0,India's latest Islamophobic law has left my country's democracy in tatters,"On Sunday night in Delhi, students protesting the newly-passed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) were brutalised by the police. The police attack was focused on one university, Jamia Millia. Similar scenes of teargas, arson and bloodshed were seen at the Aligarh Muslim University in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Both are seen as “Muslim” institutions, although students of all religions may study there. As news of police using disproportionate force against students spread across India via social media, students from other universities as well as concerned citizens joined them on the streets. Since then, the protests have not stopped; several more are planned over the coming week.

What is the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and why has it thrown India into turmoil? The act grants fast-tracked Indian citizenship to previously illegal immigrants who entered the country before 2015, and who are Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain and Parsi, as well as to Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Crucially, the act excludes Muslims.

The CAA comes hot on the heels of the disastrous National Register of Citizens (NRC) in the state of Assam, which has been used to purge the region of illegal immigrants and sent 1.9 million now stateless people to detention centres.

The move is thus perhaps unsurprising, given that the goal of Narendra Modi’s Hindu-supremacist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), re-elected with a massive majority in May, is that India is perceived as a safe haven for all religions – except Islam. Then again, it is somewhat ironic that for decades the northeast of India has claimed that migration from Bangladesh has diluted their tribal and ethnic identities, something that the CAA will potentially allows to continue.

The CAA attacks a central tenet of Indian Constitution. The country’s formation as a democratic republic in 1947 was grounded in secularism. Unlike Pakistan, which was formed as an expressly religious state, India was emphatically not. Narendra Modi’s government is not making any bones of its intention not to treat all Indians equally.

In a campaign speech this week in the state of Jharkhand, Modi said protesters against the CAA could be “recognized by their clothes” – a clear reference to Muslims. Home minister Amit Shah, who has referred to illegal immigrants as “termites”, mocked protesters: “Say you will allow all Muslims into India”. There is no hiding any more: the two most powerful men in India’s government have now made their Hindu-supremacist and Islamophobic agenda completely clear.

For India’s Muslims, the CAA stokes fears of becoming second-class citizens. Families have been torn apart by the NRC; soldiers who have won medals for their bravery are now in detention centres simply for being Muslim. If the NRC can do so much damage in one state, what horrors now lie in store for the rest of the country’s Muslim population?

Both the NRC and CAA have shaken India to its core. It is bad enough that the economy is in chaos; that the state of Kashmir has been under lockdown since August; that all the promised development has not arrived. Now India itself, and the Constitution which sets us apart, has been compromised – though at last, the fightback has begun. The Supreme Court may have deferred all petitions against the act to the end of January – yet public protests are sweeping the country.

Even the BJP’s political and ideological allies, people who supported the Citizenship Amendment Bill in Parliament, have found themselves forced to backtrack in the face of public outrage. India’s enormous and popular film industry has been scrutinised for not speaking out on its injustice; Hollywood star John Cusack shamed his Indian colleagues by expressing solidarity with the student protesters.

It is all too easy, however, to be lulled into a false sense of security that the movement against Constitutional destruction is gaining momentum. These are early days. Given the power the BJP draws from its large parliamentary majority, it is unlikely that the government will change course yet, if at all. Unless India’s many opposition parties come together to speak in one voice, they pose no challenge right now.

Time is running out for the future of a democratic India. We teeter on the edge.",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/india-narendra-modi-protests-muslim-islamophobia-a9251701.html,
1,US Congress panel criticises India’s 'punitive' new citizenship law days before Trump visit,"A US congressional panel has issued a damning new report on India’s controversial citizenship law changes, warning of the potential “punitive consequences” for Muslims, on the eve of a major visit to the country by president Donald Trump.

The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) warned that the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passed by Narendra Modi’s administration late last year, represented “a significant downward turn in religious freedom in India”.

The criticism was published in a rare standalone “factsheet” produced by the bipartisan panel, which is independent of the White House but advises the president and the State Department on foreign affairs.

Mr Trump and first lady Melania Trump will travel to India for the first time on Monday, and India is pulling out all the stops to give him a welcome of unprecedented pomp and scale. The president and Mr Modi have built a strong rapport since Mr Trump’s election in 2016, and the trip is intended to reciprocate the “Howdy Modi” stadium event put on in Texas last September.

Yet India is also in the midst of ongoing nationwide protests against the CAA and plans to extend a National Register of Citizens (NRC) nationwide. The CAA gives a route to citizenship for migrants of all major religions except Islam, while the NRC seeks to create a definitive list of Indian nationals.

Put together, the USCIRF warned, the CAA and NRC could “reserv[e] the label of illegal migrant for Muslims alone”, and “lead to the widespread disenfranchisement of Indian Muslims”.

The Indian government insists the CAA does not impact on the rights of any current citizens of India, and amid the popular backlash Mr Modi has contradicted senior ministers - and his ruling BJP party’s own 2019 election manifesto - to say there are no plans to roll out the NRC nationwide.

But the concerns expressed by the US panel follow similar comments from the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, who said on Wednesday that CAA brought “a risk of statelessness” for India’s Muslim community.

USCIRF framed the citizenship changes as coming “in the context of the growing prominence of the BJP’s Hindutva ideology… [which] views India as a Hindu state and Islam as a foreign and invading religion”.

Ahead of Mr Trump’s visit, similar concerns were conveyed to the Indian government by US Congressmen Ami Bera and George Holding, who met with Modi’s foreign secretary Harsh Shringla on Wednesday.

Speaking to the media on Thursday, India’s foreign ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said he expects there to be “an exchange of views” on matters affecting the South Asian region during talks between Mr Trump and Mr Modi in Delhi on Tuesday.

But it is trade, not human rights, that is expected to dominate proceedings. The US president has previously described India as the “tariff king of the world” and told reporters this week: “We're not treated very well by India, but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.”

Asked about that comment, Mr Kumar said it came “in the context of balance of trade”. “The US is India’s largest trading partner in goods and services,” he said. Pointing to a rise in Indian imports of US crude oil, and an expected multi-billion-dollar deal to buy American military helicopters, he added: “Efforts have been taken by India to address this particular concern… to bridge the trade deficit that exists at this point of time.”

Both sides have talked down the prospect of a significant trade deal being signed during Mr Trump’s visit, with long-standing trade differences between the two countries still to be resolved. The president was quoted as telling reporters outside Air Force One on Tuesday: “We can have a trade deal with India, but I’m really saving the big deal for later on.”

Mr Kumar said the talks were “complex negotiations… which could impact the lives of millions of people” and as such “we would not like to rush into a deal”. He said five less binding “memorandums of understanding” (MOUs) were being prepared on areas including intellectual property, trade facilitation and homeland security [cooperation].

As well as Delhi trade talks, Mr Trump’s visit will include a visit with Melania Trump to the world-famous Taj Mahal in Agra, and a stadium event in Ahmedabad, Gujarat - Mr Modi’s home state.

Mr Trump said he had been told seven million people will line the route from Ahmedabad airport to the new 110,000-capacity Modera cricket stadium, which will be inaugurated during the event.

The Indian foreign secretary has said “tens of thousands” will line the parade route as part of a “Road Show” with stages representing Indian states along the way. It is unclear why there is such a discrepancy in crowd numbers, although seven million is the estimated population of Ahmedabad as a whole.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-citizenship-law-trump-visit-modhi-muslim-uscirf-a9347051.html,
2,Inside India’s citizenship protests: Muslims fear becoming ‘refugees in their own country’,"India is currently in the grip of its largest mass protest since Indira Gandhi declared her infamous “Emergency” to quell nationwide unrest in the 1970s. Across the country, hundreds of rallies, candlelit marches and sit-ins have taken place since the government of Narendra Modi passed a bill which offers a path to citizenship for migrants of certain religions but excludes Muslims.

Defenders of the bill say it is necessary to protect those who have fled to India after suffering religious persecution in neighbouring Muslim-majority states like Bangladesh and Pakistan. But for its critics, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a major step towards the final goal of Modi’s nationalist BJP party – to turn secularist India into a Hindu nation.

From the withdrawal of Kashmir’s autonomy to his promise to build a huge temple to the Hindu deity Lord Ram on the site of the destroyed Babri Masjid mosque, Modi has pushed ahead with policies that appeal to his middle-class, Hindu nationalist base since his landslide second election win last year. Yet with Kashmir, the destruction of Babri Masjid, and even to a large degree the imposition of a register of citizens in Assam, the reaction from the left and minority communities was muted.",https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/long-reads/india-protests-citizenship-anti-caa-muslims-shaheen-bagh-modi-delhi-a9314896.html,
3,India builds detention camps for up to 1.9m people 'stripped of citizenship' in Assam,"The Indian government is building mass detention camps after almost two million people were told they could be effectively stripped of citizenship.

Around 1.9m people in the north-eastern state of Assam were excluded when India published the state’s final National Register of Citizens (NRC) list in August.

Those excluded from the register will have to appeal to prove they are citizens. The UN and other international rights groups have expressed concern that many could be rendered stateless.

The citizenship list is part of a drive to detect illegal immigrants in Assam.

The Indian government claims that the migrants have arrived from neighbouring Muslim-majority Bangladesh.

Critics say that the register has upended the lives of Muslims who have lived legally in the state for decades.

Those appealing to be put on the register will need to provide documentation, such as birth certificates, dating back decades.

Record keeping in parts of rural India is poor and many, including those building the camps, have been caught out by the NRC’s stringent requirements.

“We don’t have birth certificates,” Malati Hajong, one of the labourers working at a site near the village of Goalpara, told the Reuters news agency.

The Goalpara camp is one of at least 10 planned detention centres, according to local media reports.

It is around the size of seven football pitches and designed to hold 3,000 people.

Officials plan to have a school and hospital at the centre, as well as a high boundary wall and watchtowers for the security forces.

Critics have accused the Modi administration of using the NRC to target Assam’s large Muslim community.

But the government says it is simply complying with an order from India’s Supreme Court, which said the NRC had been delayed for too long and set a strict deadline for its completion.

Government sources say those excluded from the list retain their rights and have 120 days to appeal at local “Foreigners Tribunals”. If that fails, they can take their cases to the High Court of Assam and ultimately the Supreme Court. What happens to those who fail at all levels of appeal is yet to be decided, they said.

Last month the local chapter of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party expressed dismay after it became apparent that many Hindus had also been excluded from the list.

Officials said the government may pass legislation to protect legitimate citizens.

The government is already in the process of bringing legislation to grant citizenship to Hindu, Sikh and Buddhist immigrants from neighbouring countries.

Muslim immigrants are not included in the law.

The nationalist, hardline Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) group also called for genuine citizens to be included in the list after it emerged that Hindus had been affected. The RSS and BJP are closely affiliated.

4,UN human rights chief launches unprecedented legal action against Indian government over citizenship protests,"The UN’s human rights chief has applied to petition India’s supreme court against the Modi administration’s new citizenship laws that critics say discriminate against Muslims, in what is being described as an unprecedented move.

It comes as opposition MPs stalled proceedings in India’s parliament for a second day on Tuesday, demanding an urgent debate on the bloodshed in Delhi last week that saw at least 46 people killed and more than 400 injured.

UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet has informed India of her decision to file a brief as an amicus curiae, or third-party “friend of the court”, over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The court has already received more than 140 petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the new law.

Ms Bachelet has previously expressed concerns about the CAA and the violent police crackdown on protesters against the law, which had already claimed lives in Uttar Pradesh state and elsewhere. The mostly anti-Muslim riots in Delhi last week began with clashes between those protesting and counter-protesting over the law.

Ms Bachelet said she was concerned by reports of “police inaction in the face of attacks against Muslims by other groups”. And last month, during her regular update to the UN human rights council, she said the CAA was “of great concern”, adding that “Indians in huge numbers, and from all communities, have expressed – in a mostly peaceful manner – their opposition to the Act, and support for the country’s long tradition of secularism”.

The Modi government is facing mounting calls for home minister Amit Shah’s resignation in the wake of the violence, with police accused of standing by, or in some cases, urging on mobs as mosques and Muslim properties were destroyed. Mr Shah is responsible for policing in the capital.

Yet despite last week’s riots being the deadliest in Delhi since 1984, the government’s top leadership have offered precious little in the way of public comment. Mr Shah did not mention Delhi directly when addressing a rally for the ruling BJP party in West Bengal on Sunday, and Mr Modi has only tweeted, in English, calling for “peace and brotherhood”.

The government has, however, been swift and vociferous in its condemnation of any members of the international community raising concerns over the breakdown in law and order, and particularly the police’s failure to protect Muslims.

Raveesh Kumar, the Indian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, said India’s mission to Geneva was informed of Ms Bachelet’s application to the supreme court on Monday.

He said the CAA was “an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws”. “We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty,” he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, India summoned the Iranian ambassador after Tehran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted that his country “condemns the wave of organised violence against Indian Muslims”.

Iran became the fourth Muslim-majority nation to speak out over the Delhi riots, after Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia raised their concerns.

The US president Donald Trump failed to do so, despite the fact they were unfolding just across the city from his high-level trade talks with Indian officials. He later told a press conference that handling the riots was “up to India”.

And the UK government also toed a careful line in its response to the riots on Tuesday, during an urgent question raised in parliament by the opposition.

Labour accused India of behaving “like a state with no regard for human rights and the rule of law or the freedom of religion”, adding that it must “face the consequences of its behaviour”.

Shadow foreign office minister Khalid Mahmood described the CAA as “enabling documented migrants from neighbouring countries to seek Indian citizenship provided they meet one condition – they’re not Muslim”. “This is the first such law that has been passed in India since its independence,” he said.

Representing Johnson’s government, the foreign office minister Nigel Adams said the UK was “monitoring closely” developments in India, saying that “the events in Delhi last week were very concerning and the situation is still tense”.

But he failed to specifically criticise the Indian authorities, saying: “The death of one protester is one too many. We urge restraint from all parties and trust the Indian government will address concerns of people of all religions in India.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/delhi-riots-indian-un-human-rights-supreme-court-modi-a9372966.html,
5,What next for India's Muslims? More suffering and a further crackdown on their rights by the Modi government,"In his second term, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi’s government has expedited efforts to undermine India’s Muslims. While Muslims are widely accepted to be India’s poorest community by religion (in part a statistical quirk given that much of the Muslim middle class moved to Pakistan at partition) the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) believes that for decades other parties – notably the once dominant Congress – have prioritised Muslims over Hindus.

First to go was the “special status” granted to India’s only Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir. Amongst the provisions removed was that on “outsiders” buying land in the state. This, according to the government, had harmed economic development. Curiously, the government has no plans to remove similar protection granted to several areas of north east India.

Next was a double whammy of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The government has suggested that the NRC – a measure intended to identify illegal immigrants in Assam – should be rolled out nationwide and reportedly instructed India’s states to start constructing detention centres.

Now, proving citizenship in a country in which 38 per cent of under-fives lack birth certificates is likely to prove trickier than the government suggests. And those who may struggle are unlikely to be just Muslims. This is where the CAA comes in, making those who practise five religions “indigenous” to India – namely Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis – along with Christians, eligible for Indian citizenship. The measure applies to those escaping persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan (though how people unable to prove they are Indian would be able to prove they came from somewhere else is anyone’s guess). Undocumented Muslims are notably not eligible for citizenship.

Various ministers have reiterated that Indian Muslims have nothing to fear. But if angry mobs start attacking Muslims and burning their homes – as happened in Delhi last week – one outcome could be that any documentation is destroyed. So despite the government’s assurances, it is not difficult to envisage a scenario in which some proportion of India’s Muslims are moved to detention centres.

It’s also worth noting that India would be far from the first country in its neighbourhood to do this to a Muslim minority. Around one million Uighurs are thought to be in re-education and internment camps in China while Myanmar’s Rohingayas were first moved into camps before they fled into Bangladesh.

Next up may well be the introduction of a uniform civil code. Since Independence, each religion has its own personal law (relating to marriage and divorce, for instance). Replacing it with a uniform code would be far from unjustifiable, not least on the grounds that the current system can be seen to discriminate against Muslim women.

Once Muslims’ rights have finished being reduced their secondary status will presumably be apparent.

What next? Indian Muslims’ relative immunity from radicalisation seems likely to be sorely tested. Historically, terrorist attacks against India have been blamed on Pakistan-connected groups. “Home grown” terrorism could well provide justification for a further crackdown by the government.

Social dynamics also imply that the violence in Delhi may well be a harbinger of what’s to come. Youth unemployment stands at around 10 per cent according to the International Labour Organisation, though some studies put the figure substantially higher. Equally troubling is the societal implications of the highly skewed male-female ratio in India (along with China) resulting from female infanticide. The existence of these “bare branches”, noted a prescient article from 2004, is likely to aggravate “societal instability, violent crime and gang formation”.

As Donald Trump put it during his recent visit, India “has always been admired around the Earth as the place where millions upon millions of Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jains, Buddhists, Christians, and Jews worship side by side in harmony”. If India continues on its current pathway, this harmony may well become more difficult to discern.",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/india-modi-muslims-delhi-riots-hindu-violence-army-rights-a9370111.html,
6,Shaheen Bagh protest: Baby dies from exposure to cold as mother takes part in 50-day Delhi sit-in,"A four-month-old baby boy has died in India after his mother brought him along to protests against Narendra Modi’s new citizenship law.

The child’s 24-year-old mother, Nazia, had been taking part in the occupation of a major road in Delhi, a sit-in protest that has now entered its 52nd day.

The demonstration in the Shaheen Bagh neighbourhood has persisted despite temperatures dipping into single digits on cold nights in the capital.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

The protests have been fuelled by opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a law granting a new path to Indian citizenship for refugees of all religions except Muslims.

A protest organiser confirmed to The Independent that Nazia’s son, Mohammed Jahaan, had died after accompanying her to the sit-in, where many participants are Muslim women and are observing a hunger strike for 12 to 14 hours a day.

Nazia’s husband, Mohammed Arif, said she had returned home with Jahaan and their two other children – a five-year-old girl and a boy aged one – at around 10pm on 29 January, and Jahaan appeared to have a fever.

The baby awoke crying in the night, and the couple resolved to bring him to see a doctor the next day. They found him unresponsive in the morning, however, and he was declared dead upon arrival at hospital.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Nazia blamed the government’s measures, which have sparked protests across the country, for her child’s death.

“I would bring him to the protest to fight for the future. He was only a witness in the fight,” she said.

She suggested her family may not support her involvement in the protests, but said what happened to Jahaan would only strengthen her resolve to keep demonstrating.

“I am not afraid of anyone now,” she said. “I have already lost a child. I don’t mind if the lives of my other two kids are sacrificed for the same cause.”

The Modi administration says the CAA will help protect minorities fleeing to India from its Muslim-majority neighbours, including Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

But critics of the measure say existing asylum laws already catered well to anyone fleeing persecution, and that the CAA is instead the latest attempt to reform India as a Hindu nation. Muslims make up secular India’s largest minority, around 14 per cent of the population.

The law and a connected crackdown on illegal immigrants, through the introduction of a National Register of Citizens, have sparked hundreds of protest rallies across the country and at-times deadly clashes between protesters and police.

Women have been at the forefront of the anti-CAA backlash in many places, and no more so than at Shaheen Bagh, in spite of the generally conservative perception of gender roles that persists in India today.

Speaking to The Independent at the sit-in last week, 62-year-old Shaheen said she had the strength to stand up to the government’s measures precisely “because I am woman”. Despite being part of the protest from the start, she said she was “fit and strong… [with] the energy to continue the fight for our country”. “Women in India are really powerful, more so than the men perhaps,” she said.

Shaheen called the CAA part of “a cumulative effort to take my rights away from me”, and an affront to “the beautiful [Indian] constitution, which is secular in nature”. “We have no choice but to come forward and fight,” she said.

Jahaan’s death has already led to renewed criticisms of the women protesting at Shaheen Bagh.

Indian media widely reported on a letter, written by the 12-year-old winner of a national bravery award, urging the Supreme Court to prevent children from being brought to protests.

Zen Gunratan Sadavarte’s letter accused the protesters of “ignoring the fact that newborn babies need a lot of attention and care”, calling the decision to bring them to protests a violation of their rights. Her comments were widely shared on social media.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/shaheen-bagh-protest-india-delhi-modi-citizenship-muslim-law-baby-death-a9318976.html,
7,"While Muslims are being murdered in India, the rest of the world is too slow to condemn","On 9 to 10 November 1938 the German government encouraged its supporters to burn down synagogues and smash up Jewish homes, shops, businesses, schools. At least 91 Jews – and probably many more – were killed by Nazi supporters egged on by Joseph Goebbels, the minister for public enlightenment and propaganda, in what became known as Kristallnacht – “the Night of Broken Glass”. It was a decisive staging post on the road to mass genocide.

On 23 February 2020 in Delhi, Hindu nationalist mobs roamed the streets burning and looting mosques together with Muslim homes, shops and businesses. They killed or burned alive Muslims who could not escape and the victims were largely unprotected by the police. At least 37 people, almost all Muslims, were killed and many others beaten half to death: a two-year-old baby was stripped by a gang to see if he was circumcised – as Muslims usually are, but Hindus are not. Some Muslim women pretended to be Hindus in order to escape.

Government complicity was not as direct as in Germany 82 years earlier, but activists of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), led by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, were reported as being in the forefront of the attacks on Muslims. A video was published showing Muslim men, covered in blood from beatings, being forced to lie on the ground by police officers and compelled to sing patriotic songs. Modi said nothing for several days and then made a vague appeal for “peace and brotherhood”.

The government’s real attitude towards the violence was shown when it instantly transferred a judge critical of its actions during the riots. Judge Muralidhar of the Delhi High Court was hearing petitions about the violence when he said that the court could not allow “another 1984” to happen, referring to the killing of 3,000 Sikhs by mobs in Delhi in that year after the assassination of former prime minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards. He said the government should provide shelter for those who had been forced to flee and questioned if the police were properly recording victims’ complaints.

The government says that Judge Muralidhar’s transfer had already been announced and claims that its speedy implementation of the move had nothing to do with his remarks.

Accusations of fascist behaviour by present day political leaders and their governments, similar to that of fascist regimes in Germany, Italy and Spain in the 1930s and 1940s, should not be made lightly. Such comparisons have been frequently levelled in recent years against nationalist, authoritarian populists from the US and the Philippines to Poland to Brazil. Often the allegation is believed by the accuser and, at other times, it is simply a term of abuse. Yet Modi and the BJP appear closer than other right-wing regimes to traditional fascism in their extreme nationalism and readiness to use violence. At the centre of their agenda is their brand of Hindu nationalism and a relentless bid to marginalise or evict India’s 200 million Muslims.

The rest of the world has been slow to grasp the gravity of what is happening in India because the Modi government has played down its project to shift India away from its previous status as a pluralistic secular state. The sheer number of people negatively affected by this change is gigantic: if the Muslim minority in India was a separate country then it would be eighth largest state in the world by population.

The violence in Delhi this week stems from the fear and hatred generated by the government-directed pincer movement against Muslims in India. One pincer is in the shape of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), under which non-Muslim migrants can swiftly gain Indian citizenship but Muslims cannot. Even more threatening is the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which is likely to deprive many Indian Muslims of their citizenship. It was the non-violent protests and demonstrations opposing these measures that provoked the Hindu nationalist mobs into staging what was close to a pogrom earlier this week.

Just how far Modi and the BJP will go in their anti-Muslim campaign is already in evidence in Jammu and Kashmir, the one Indian state with a Muslim majority. It was summarily stripped of its autonomy last August and has been locked down ever since. Mass detentions and torture are the norm according to the few witnesses able to report what they have seen.

For 150 days after the government revoked Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, the internet was cut off and it has only been restored to a very limited degree since January. The security forces detain who they want and distraught family members complain that they cannot find their relatives or that they are too poor to visit them in prisons that may be 800 miles away.

The isolation of Kashmir has largely worked from the government point of view in sealing it off from the outside world. But would it make much difference if events there were better known? The burnings and killings in Delhi this week are well publicised, but regarded with a certain tolerance internationally: Modi can trade off India’s reputation as a ramshackle democracy and a feeling that “communal violence” is traditional in India, like hurricanes in Florida or earthquakes in Japan, and nobody is really to blame.

There has been an encouraging, though fiercely repressed, wave of opposition in India to the degradation of its non-sectarian traditions. The danger here – and the mobs in Delhi may be a sign of this – is that Modi and his government will respond to these protests by playing the Hindu nationalist card even more strongly.

Dealing with foreign criticism, the government may say that, regardless of its domestic political programme, it is supercharging economic growth and this excuses its other failings. Authoritarian regimes, with control over most of their own media, often make such claims and, when economic statistics show the opposite, they simply fake a new set of figures. A recent study of the Indian economy noted that, while overall economic growth had supposedly risen strongly, the growth in investment, profits, tax revenues, imports, exports, industrial output and credit had all weakened in recent years.

In one respect, Modi is in a stronger position than Germany after Kristallnacht. President Roosevelt responded with a statement denouncing antisemitism and violence in Germany and promptly withdrew the US ambassador. President Trump, on a two-day visit to India at a time that Muslims were being hunted down and killed a few miles from where he was sitting, said he was satisfied that Modi was working “really hard” to establish religious freedom.",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/delhi-riots-news-narendra-modi-muslims-hindus-jammu-kashmir-trump-a9365376.html,
8,Trump India visit: Anti-Muslim citizenship law and stalled trade deal to headline trip,"Citizenship law changes in India that block Muslim migrants from obtaining citizenship and a stalled trade pact will highlight Donald Trump's agenda when he makes his first diplomat trip to the country next week.

But among the top agenda items will be the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), passed by Modi's administration late last year, which gives a route to citizenship to migrants of all major religious groups except one: Muslims.

""I expect it will come up"" when Mr Trump and Mr Modi speak on Tuesday, the senior administration official said on a Friday afternoon conference call with reporters.

The same senior official said the US president and others in the administration have ""concerns"" about the law, noting religious freedom is ""important"" to the White House.

The US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), which is independent of the White House, warned the law represents ""a significant downward turn in religious freedom in India.""

Meantime, Mr Trump long has predicted he and Mr Modi will soon strike a sweeping trade pact. Doing so would add such an agreement to several others his administration has inked with China and Japan, as well as one with Canada and Mexico.

The American president would, if the two sides can strike a deal, achieve another 2016 campaign promise. Re-writing the United States' major trade pacts was a top vow he made to voters. But when he tried to tout a deal with New Delhi on Thursday during an event with former inmates in Las Vegas, he turned instead to the size of his social media presence.

""We had horrible, horrible deals, or no deals at all, and now we have phenomenal deals. We made a massive deal with China. Then we did the USMCA; that's Mexico, Canada. We did a $40 billion-a-year deal with Japan and we did a deal with South Korea, and we have other deals, too,"" he said. ""And I'm going to India next week and we're talking about – you know, they have 1.5 billion people, and Prime Minister Modi is No. 2 on Facebook. No. 2. Think of that.""

""You know who No. 1 is? Trump,"" he said boastfully. ""Do you believe that? Trump. No. 1.""

Soon, however, he was back on topic – though it was not immediately clear why he spoke about an unfinished trade deal at an event about an organization that strives to help former convicts transition into civilian society. And, in typical fashion, he committed to nothing, while still leaving open the door a massive trade pact might come together in the next four days.

""But we're going to India, and we may make a tremendous deal there, or maybe we'll slow it down. We'll do it after the election. I think that could happen too,"" he said before dropping his signature, made-for-television-cliffhanger line: ""So we'll see what happens.""

But there are ""a lot, a bunch"" of unresolved issues, the senior administration official said of months-old talks. The White House sees ""an increase in barriers, not a decrease,"" the official said, meaning blockages to US services and goods being allowed into India.

""Whether or not an announcement on a trade pact,"" the senior official said, ""is really wholly dependent on what the Indians are prepared to do.""",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-india-visit-modi-anti-muslim-citizenship-trade-deal-a9351986.html,
9,"In Modi’s India, police bulldoze homes of ‘suspected immigrant’ workers and ‘don’t have time’ to check IDs","It has become commonplace in Narendra Modi’s India for senior political figures to speak of Muslim immigrant workers in extremely derogatory terms – usually as “infiltrators”, sometimes as “termites”.

And that rhetoric bore fruit this week in the major city of Bengaluru, formerly Bangalore, where the shanty homes of hundreds of labourers were bulldozed on the pretext that they were housing “suspected illegal immigrants”.

The action, taken with police involvement yet seemingly on no official orders, has left hundreds homeless – either forced to share the limited space in those huts that are still standing, or else sleep on the streets.

And while the city authority is framing the incident as the actions of a rogue middle-ranking official, it has been welcomed by the local branch of Modi’s ruling BJP party, which called it “the right decision”.

The incident began last Sunday when men in JCB bulldozers, flanked by plainclothes police officers, descended on the 600-home informal settlement of Kariyammana Agrahara, to the east of the city.

They declared that all those present were illegal Bangladeshi migrants, and started tearing apart their homes.

Videos that have since gone viral on social media show the residents trying to produce their voter ID cards, biometric registration documents known as Aadhaar, and other evidence that they were in fact born and raised in other states of India.

But the police continued regardless, later telling a local newspaper that they have neither the time nor the money to verify such documents with other state authorities.

The destruction ended after around 200 homes were destroyed, and after submissions by legal activists the Karnataka state High Court issued a stay order on Wednesday, as well as an immediate inquiry into both the police and municipal corporation to determine how something like this could happen.

Lekha Adavi, a member of the Alternative Law Forum collective which has been providing Bengaluru’s migrant workers with free legal support, told The Independent that those living in the slum came to the city from other Indian states like West Bengal, Assam, or even within Karnataka itself.

And even if they were illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, or third- or fourth-generation migrants, neither the municipal authorities nor the local police has the jurisdiction to act in the way it did – that would be a matter for the federal authorities.

Adavi said the incident was particularly concerning because it came just days after the local BJP legislative assembly member (MLA) for the area, Aravind Limbavali, tweeted a video of the settlement, saying it was “without cleanliness ... a site of illegal activity” and housing people who “are suspect to be illegal immigrants of Bangladesh”.

Such comments do not exist in isolation. Only two days after the demolition, the BJP’s most senior official in West Bengal state, Dilip Ghosh, said there were “two crore [20 million] Bangladeshi Muslim infiltrators” who had entered India, adding that “we will not allow any to stay here”.

Adavi said there was clearly a link between the evictions in Bengaluru and a broader anti-immigrant “sense across India right now”, with the government recently passing a citizenship law for refugees that excludes Muslims, and the exercise of creating a register of legal citizens (NRC) in Assam state.

“It is very clear that these guys are implementing their [the BJP’s] agenda, there is nothing more or less to it. They want to implement their agenda of persecuting Muslims, and Bangladeshi Muslim immigrants happen to be one pawn in that entire agenda,” she said.

Mohammed Riyadh Ul Islam, 24, told NDTV he had been forced to stay this week in a hut that already housed two others before the demolitions, saying his home was destroyed on Sunday.

He agreed that “if there are Bangladeshis here, it is the job of police to do an inquiry and remove them”.

“[But] we are from Assam – we just went through NRC and we have all the proof. Police should check those papers instead of saying ‘Bangladeshis’ and demolishing houses. All of us living here are from different parts of India.”

Siddaramaiah, the former chief minister of Karnataka, called the evictions and demolition “an inhumane act by the BJP government”.

And VS Ugrappa, a spokesperson for the opposition Congress party, said: “God only knows what happens to the people who are there. It is nothing but a jungle raj and ultimately the government has to be held responsible.”

When approached by the Deccan Herald newspaper, a senior police officer at the station local to Kariyammana Agrahara suggested it was up to the slum residents to provide verification for their own ID documents, adding: “What is the guarantee that these documents are genuine?”

He said previous attempts by officers to travel to West Bengal and verify migrant workers’ documents had been met with non-compliance by the state authorities there.

D Randeep, head of the local branch of the municipal authority, said in a statement that “no senior officials were informed beforehand” about the evictions. He said the engineer whose letter to police sparked the action would face unspecified “action” and that a detailed report would be produced on Sunday’s events.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-bengaluru-evictions-demolition-slum-shelters-bangladeshi-modi-a9300511.html,
10,Trump and Modi's bromance is real — and what's scary is what the president might be learning,"On Monday in Ahmedabad, president Donald Trump and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the world’s largest cricket stadium, jointly addressing an audience of 125,000 jubilant Indians.

It was the first stop on Trump’s maiden diplomatic two-day visit to India, in Modi’s home state of Gujarat. Certainly, there are few places in the world where Trump can enjoy the sort of rock-star reception, replete with folk dancers and Bollywood singers, that India afforded him.

The event, billed as “Namaste Trump”, was a nod to the “Howdy Modi” spectacle rolled out for Modi last fall in Houston. Both stocky strongmen exchanged embraces and rhetorical flourishes, as Trump painfully contorted his way through snippets of Hindi and the names of hallowed figures from Sachin Tendulkar to Swami Vivekananda.

Trump received the pageantry befitting an autocrat whose ego is bound up with crowd sizes. Modi and his fabled “56-inch chest” can summon up throngs at the scale that would make Trump blush.

Trump has long expounded over his fraternal relationship with Modi. Indeed, there’s much that Trump must admire – and perhaps is envious of – when he takes a look at how his Indian ruling counterpart operates.

Since the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took power in 2014, Modi and his regime have presided over a steady erosion of the institutional and ideological foundations of the Indian secular republic to realize the political horizon of a Hindu Rashtra (nation) where minorities are second-class citizens, if not cleansed from the body politic altogether.

Modi, like Trump, channeled populist rage and majoritarian resentment by directing ire upon a corrupt “globalist” establishment, and branding himself as a pro-growth economic reformer and anti-red tape crusader.

Trump’s nativist “America First” policy is matched by the BJP’s autarkic “Make in India” drive. Ironically, at the heart of the ongoing economic strain between the two is that Modi is too protectionist for Trump’s ostensibly mercantilist sensibilities.

Trump’s pro-Wall Street administration is underpinned by corporatism and fueled by white identity politics. Meanwhile, jobless growth and crony capitalism define Modi’s stewardship over the economy, as popular anxiety has been ensnared by a virulent Hindu identity politics. During Modi’s first term, this played out in the form of mob-led cow vigilante violence, that primarily targeted Muslims in grisly public lynchings.

The culture of impunity is unparalleled. While Trump surrounds himself with a revolving door of unsavory figures and controversially pardoned those like Michael Milken (and might extend clemency to Roger Stone), Modi counts amongst his political cadre Amit Shah, the Indian home minister who has escaped murder and kidnapping charges, and Yogi Adityanath, a bigoted monk and current chief minister of the country’s most populous state.

After the BJP secured a second term in May last year, the gloves came off.

While Trump’s Muslim ban and anti-immigration measures had to bypass Congress, Shah managed to push the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), a chilling anti-Muslim citizenship law, through the Indian Parliament. He also revoked the autonomy of Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, which has endured the longest internet shutdown recorded in any democratic country along with widespread detentions and ongoing human rights abuses.

The BJP has also primed the country for a National Register of Citizens drive before 2024, aimed at identifying and removing illegal immigrants in what is essentially a bureaucratic cleansing initiative. Detention centers that could rival China’s are being built for those eventually displaced and rendered stateless, in what could end up being the largest disenfranchisement drive in history.

In response to widespread anti-CAA protests, the government’s crackdown has been unrelenting. Systematic targeting of university students and Muslims by police brutality and far-right thuggery has wrought an escalating climate of violence across India’s streets.

Disinformation campaigns were critical digital components in both Trump’s and Modi’s electoral victories. But the scourge of fake news has ravaged India’s public discourse to the extent where it has been weaponized by those in power to devastating effect.

One of the most stunning developments is how the Indian press has cravenly bent the knee, pumping out government propaganda and acting as Modi’s jingoistic press secretary. Journalists are threatened, dissent is gagged. Trump on the other hand is regularly lambasted by the US media, with even occasional pushback from Fox News.

Fascism ultimately ends with one-party rule over the state’s legal, institutional and ideological apparatuses. A cult of personality that harnesses nostalgia for a mythical past in service of national renewal is very much part of an old playbook that Modi and Trump have benefited from.

The difference is that Modi is comfortably – and terrifyingly – ahead of the pack of ascendant far-right regimes strewn across the international arena. Under his reign, Indian democracy has degenerated into a brutish theocracy that draws upon vast reserves of anger, social sadism and hyper-masculine worship of power.

Yet, what appears to be the Trumpification of India, to be sure, precedes Trump. Rather, the “New India” might be what Pankaj Mishra calls “Trump’s spiritual home”.",https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/trump-modi-india-pm-visit-trip-us-relationship-a9362261.html,
11,Indian police officer tells citizenship law protesters to 'go to Pakistan',"A senior police officer in an Indian state which has seen 19 deaths in protests over a controversial citizenship law has been filmed telling demonstrators to “go to Pakistan”.

Critics have claimed a new law which makes it easier for members of persecuted religious minorities, but not Muslims, to become eligible for citizenship is discriminatory and violates India's secular constitution.

Uttar Pradesh (UP), the country’s most populous state with nearly 20 per cent of its population Muslim, has seen the majority of at least 25 deaths so far during the protests.

Akhilesh Narayan Singh, a senior UP police officer, was filmed telling protesters to “go to Pakistan if you don't want to live here” in a video which has been widely-circulated on social media.

The video is likely to compound concerns that Muslims are being marginalised under Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government.

Mr Singh later told Reuters his comments were a response to some protesters who had been shouting pro-Pakistan slogans.

“It is in this situation I told them to go to Pakistan,” he said on Saturday.

The controversy over the video came as the UP chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, rebuffed accusations from rights groups of police abuses during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Mr Adityanath, a hardline Hindu priest who belongs to Mr Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, has claimed his tough policies have restored calm to the state.

“Every rioter is shocked. Every troublemaker is astonished. Looking at the strictness of the Yogi government, everyone is silent,” he wrote on one of his official Twitter accounts.

“Do whatever you want to, but the damages will be paid by those who cause damages.”

Last week, the UP government said it was demanding millions of rupees from more than 200 people and threatened to confiscate demonstrators' property to pay for damages during protests.

Rights groups have accused the state government of “employing unlawful and lethal tactics” against protesters and decried what they say have been mass detentions in UP, where officers have arrested more than 1,000 people.

The CAA allows Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities to become citizens in India if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in neighbouring Muslim-majority countries - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

However, the law does not offer concessions to Muslims.

Officials from the opposition Congress party were set to lead protests on Saturday under the slogan ""Save Constitution-Save India"".

“They can punish us, throw us in jail, siphon our property but they will not be able to stop us from continuing our protest,” said Akhilesh Tomar, a student activist who is working with the Congress to coordinate protests in four Muslim-dominated districts of UP.

Protests were also planned in the northeastern state of Assam, where migration has long been an emotive political issue.

Meanwhile, Hindu activists associated with Mr Modi's party were conducting workshops in slums in an effort to ease public discontent.

“We have to explain the facts to the common people who are being misled against the law by the opposition,” said Ram Naresh Tanwar, a member of a group called the Hindu Jagran Samiti, or Hindu awareness committee, in New Delhi.

Twenty-three people have been killed nationwide since the law was passed in parliament earlier this month in protests that represent the first major roadblock for Mr Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda since his party's landslide re-election last spring.

Most of the deaths have occurred in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where 20 per cent of the state's 200 million people are Muslim.

Police, who deny any wrongdoing, said that among the 15 people killed in the state was an eight-year-old boy who died in a stampede in the city of Varanasi, the heart of Mr Modi's parliamentary constituency.

Since last week, police in Uttar Pradesh have taken nearly 900 people into custody for engaging in violence.

Authorities across the country have scrambled to contain the situation, banning public gatherings under Section 144, a British colonial-era law, and blocking internet access.

India's Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued an advisory on Friday night asking broadcasters across the country to refrain from using content that could inflame further violence.

A group of politicians from the opposition Trinamool Congress party who travelled to Uttar Pradesh on Sunday to meet with families of those killed in the violence were not permitted to leave the airport runway, police said.

“We will not permit them because Section 144 is imposed in the area and it can make the atmosphere more tense,” said Uttar Pradesh's police chief, OP Singh.

In the southern state of Tamil Nadu, about 500 Muslim and leftist activists protested, defying a ban on public gatherings there.

Meanwhile, Mr Modi took the stage at a rally in the capital launching his Bharatiya Janata Party's campaign for New Delhi legislative assembly elections in February, and quickly turned to the contentious new law.

“People who are trying to spread lies and fear, look at my work. If you see any trace of divisiveness in my work, show it to the world,” he said.

Mr Modi accused the main opposition Congress party of conspiring to “push not only New Delhi but other parts of the country into a fear psychosis”.

“They are trying every tactic to push me out of power,” he said, urging protesters to desist from attacks on police and other violence.

The new law allows Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens if they can show they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.

Critics have slammed the legislation as a violation of India's secular constitution and have called it the latest effort by Mr Modi's government to marginalise the country's 200 million Muslims.

14,"India protests: Three dead and 1,200 arrested as demonstrations rage against citizenship law","At least three people have died and 1,200 have been arrested amid protests against India’s controversial new citizenship law.

Demonstrators defied a ban on assembly and took to the streets in many of the country’s biggest cities as anger erupted over the law, which excludes Muslims.

Two people were killed during clashes with police in Mangalore, a city in the southern Karnataka state, where police fired warning shots and used tear gas and batons to disperse a large group of protesters.

Protesters also clashed with police in parts of Lucknow, the state capital of northern Uttar Pradesh state, where police said one person died from a gunshot fired by a demonstrator.

The protesters torched a bus, hurled rocks at police and damaged some police posts and vehicles, authorities said.

Authorities have pushed back by setting up roadblocks and disrupting internet and phone services, including in parts of New Delhi.

They have also tightened restrictions on protesters in the northeastern border state of Assam, where the protests began last week, and have imposed a curfew in some places.

The new citizenship law applies to Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally but can demonstrate religious persecution in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, however it excludes Muslims.

The legislation has sparked anger at what many see as the government’s push to bring India closer to a Hindu state.

Critics say it is the latest effort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist-led government to marginalise India’s 200 million Muslims, and a violation of the country’s secular constitution.

Mr Modi has defended it as a humanitarian gesture.

Rather than containing uprisings, the protest bans appear to be helping them spread – from Assam and a handful of university campuses and Muslim enclaves in the capital to campuses and cities from coast to coast.

Zoya Hasan, a political scientist in New Delhi, said: “I think what is wonderful is that young people all in their Twenties have so vividly understood the game plan, which is to divide people.

“What people are saying is that you are going to divide, we are going to multiply.”

Some of the country’s divided opposition parties have found common ground in condemning what they say has been a heavy-handed official response to the protests.

In New Delhi, Yogendra Yadav, a well-known political activist and the chief of the Swaraj India party, was among 1,200 protesters detained at the city’s Red Fort and the surrounding historic district.

Anil Kumar, a police spokesman, said all the protesters were released later on Thursday.

15,Indian citizenship law: More than 100 arrested after defying police ban on protests,"Police detained more than 100 protesters in key Indian cities on Thursday, as they defied a ban on protests that authorities hope will stop widespread demonstrations against a new citizenship law which, opponents say, will threaten the secular nature of Indian democracy.

Dozens of demonstrations were to take place around the country as opposition grows to a new citizenship law that excludes Muslims. The law has sparked anger at what many see as the government’s push to bring India closer to a Hindu state.

Historian Ramchandra Guha, a biographer of India‘s independence leader Mohandas Gandhi, was among those detained in Bangalore, the capital of southern Karanataka state.

When reached by the phone, Mr Guha said he was in a bus with other detainees and did not know where the police were taking them.

In New Delhi, Yogendra Yadav, the chief of the Swaraj India party, was among those detained as protesters said they would go ahead with a demonstration at New Delhi’s iconic Red Fort and surrounding historic district.

Internet services were blocked in some parts of New Delhi, a tactic authorities are known to use in other parts of the subcontinent – such as in the disputed territory of Kashmir – to try to stop protests from being organised. Such tactics are rare for the capital.

The new citizenship law applies to Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally but can demonstrate religious persecution in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. It does not apply to Muslims.

Critics say it’s the latest effort by prime minister Narendra Modi‘s Hindu nationalist-led government to marginalise India’s 200-million Muslims, and a violation of the country’s secular constitution.

Mr Modi has defended it as a humanitarian gesture.

The law’s enactment last week follows a contentious process in northeastern Assam state intended to weed out people who entered illegally. Nearly 2 million people in Assam were excluded from an official list of citizens, about half Hindu and half Muslim, and have been asked to prove their citizenship or else be considered foreign.

India is also building a detention centre for some of the tens of thousands of people – with the courts expected to ultimately determine who has entered illegally. Mr Modi’s interior minister, Amit Shah, has pledged to roll out the exercise nationwide.

Some Indian Muslims fear it’s a means by which Hindu nationalists can put them in detention or deport them from the country.

On Wednesday, authorities tightened restrictions on protesters, expanding the blockade on internet use along with a curfew in Assam.

16,Trump hails Modi as ‘true friend’ as host faces backlash over ‘anti-Muslim’ citizenship law,"Donald Trump has praised India as “a democratic, peaceful country” and reaffirmed his close ties to “true friend” Narendra Modi at a huge stadium rally, even as his host faced a fierce public backlash over what critics call attempts to undermine the country’s secular constitution and marginalise its Muslim minority.

The brand new, 110,000-capacity Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad had barely emptied when news emerged that a police head constable had been killed in clashes in the capital, Delhi, as protests against Modi’s government threatened to overshadow Donald and Melania Trump’s maiden, two-day visit to the country.

In his speech on Monday, the US president emphasised the difference between India and China, the rival giant in Asia, saying the former’s economic growth was all the more remarkable because it was achieved “as a democratic country, a peaceful country, a tolerant country – as a great, free country”. This success, he said, made it “an example to every nation in the world”.

Mr Modi, hosting Mr Trump in his home state, led the crowd in chants of “namaste Trump” and “long live India-US friendship”, and hailed the event as a sign of a “far greater and closer relationship” between the two countries. He had earlier tweeted, as Mr Trump was about to land in India, a phrase in Hindi that translates as “the guest is God”.

While a steady stream of people walked out as Mr Trump spoke – some in the audience not understanding English – he also received big cheers for vowing to tackle “bloodthirsty Islamist terrorism” and when he lathered Mr Modi with praise, calling him a “tremendously successful leader”.

The Namaste Trump event was the biggest political rally that the US president has ever addressed, and the high point in spectacle of his and Ms Trump’s 36-hour stay, which also included a sunset visit to the Taj Mahal, the world-famous 17th-century monument to love.

With seats also laid out in rows across the pitch, Mr Trump claimed an audience of “125,000 beating hearts in this stadium”. By that stage in the speech, however, many of those seats had emptied.

After arriving in Air Force One on Monday afternoon, Mr Trump was warmly welcomed by Mr Modi, and then treated to a 22km “road show” of stages promoting India’s 28 states on the route to the stadium.

The Trumps also fitted in a quick stop at an ashram where Mahatma Gandhi lived for 13 years as he launched India’s independence movement. They were given prayer shawls and shown the workings of a cotton loom, a symbol of Gandhi’s humble life, and Mr Trump signed a message in the guest book, addressed ”to my great friend Prime Minister Modi”.

The US president may have felt let down by the mere tens of thousands who lined the road-show route to greet him – he had repeatedly claimed in the run-up to this trip that he would be met by millions – but he cannot have been disappointed by the roar that greeted him as he took to the stage in the Motera stadium. The crowd had been warmed up with “Macho Man” by the Village People booming out over the sound system, as well as a medley of Elton John songs.

On stage, Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged a bear-hug before waving to the crowd, after which the national anthems of both countries were played.

Forced to stick to his script, with the speech translated into Hindi on screens behind him, Mr Trump stuck mainly to safe, crowd-pleasing topics. He brought up cricket – although mispronouncing the name of Indian legend Sachin Tendulkar – Bollywood, and the “profound honour” of inaugurating the pristine stadium.

“Melania and my family will always remember this remarkable hospitality… From this day on, India will always hold a very special place in our hearts,” Mr Trump said.

His visit comes at a difficult time for Mr Modi, however, who is facing a national protest that began in mid-December as a backlash against new laws granting a route to citizenship for refugees of every major South Asian religion – except Muslims. Following the decision to revoke Muslim-majority Kashmir’s autonomy, and to build a Hindu temple on the site of the demolished Babri Masjid mosque, the legislation has provoked outrage among Muslims and supporters of India’s secular origins alike.

In Delhi, those protests boiled over on Monday, with hundreds of protesters and supporters of the new laws clashing in the streets, throwing stones and setting fires. Police confirmed that one officer was killed during the violence.

White House officials have said the president will raise US concerns about religious freedom and authoritarianism during his trip, but there was no overt criticism to be found in Mr Trump’s address at the stadium.

Mr Trump said his host, who rose to be prime minister from humble beginnings as the son of a tea seller, was “living proof that with hard work and devotion, Indians can accomplish anything they want”. “Everybody loves him – but I will tell you this, he’s very tough,” he said of Modi.

With supportive audience members bussed in from many miles away to back Mr Modi and give Mr Trump the welcome he craved, the lack of criticism on the platform was perhaps unsurprising.

Renju, 42, told The Independent that she had left her home in neighbouring Kerala state at 7am to be there for the afternoon rally and to “support Trump and Modi”.

She praised Mr Modi – “one of the best leaders we have ever witnessed” – and, on comparisons between him and Mr Trump, she said: “They are both daring, courageous leaders. Both are fighting against terrorism – that is the best thing.”

Vijesh Panicker, 32, works for the US company TTec in Ahmedabad. He said the city was “so glad and proud to have this fantastic stadium”, as well as being “excited to welcome Trump on his first visit to India”.

Mr Panicker said he liked Mr Trump because he was “a different personality compared with past [US] leaders”. “I think he is better than Obama – he is certainly more famous. He appeared in the [WWE] wrestling on TV! And Trump is very fond of Modi, so hopefully we can have better ties and better trade in future because of this.”

Unsurprisingly for a rally like this, it was hard to find anyone with a bad word to say about either leader. Manoj Kumar, 50, said he was attending in traditional dress to represent his community, a group of Keralan migrants based in Ahmedabad. He only found out about his invitation a week ago, when he and other members of the Ahmedabad Kerala Samajan were “told to be here”.

He said both Mr Trump and Mr Modi were “charismatic in nature… truly global leaders”. “This [event] is not just a celebration, it is the beginning of a bilateral relationship that can benefit all countries in the world,” he said.

Asked about potentially awkward comments made last week by Mr Trump – that India had “treated us very badly” on trade – Mr Kumar said: “There are certain things I cannot comment on. This is a political issue – please just ask general questions.”

Mr Modi and Mr Trump’s speeches lasted well under an hour combined – brief, arguably, considering the estimated £11m India has spent preparing just for this leg of the trip.

After Ahmedabad, the Trumps were scheduled to fly on to Agra where they will visit the Taj Mahal.

High-level talks will then be held throughout the day in Delhi on Tuesday, as long as plans are not derailed by the violent protests. The Trumps will then be treated to a state dinner with India’s president, Ram Nath Kovind, before they fly out from Delhi.

Not so long ago, there had been high hopes that the talks would herald a major trade pact to reduce tariffs, in addition to some multi-billion-dollar Indian acquisitions of US defence equipment. On stage, Mr Trump confirmed that a deal to sell $3bn of military equipment, including all-purpose helicopters, would be signed in Delhi.

Both sides have since said that a broad breakthrough on trade is unlikely, but the talks are still supposed to emphasise a growing strategic partnership between the two nations.

Dr Jagannath Panda, a research fellow at the Delhi-based Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, said the US and India were natural allies with a shared goal to stem China’s rising dominance in Asia.

“Building credible partnerships… [with] pro-democratic regimes across the region becomes a strategic necessity, and the US will certainly need India on such a mission more than any other power in the region,” he said.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/trump-india-visit-modi-speech-ahmedabad-modera-stadium-cricket-a9354316.html,
17,"India protests: 14 people dead and 4,000 detained as police cut internet in bid to quell growing demonstrations","Police in India banned public gatherings and continued clampdowns in Muslim-majority regions for a third day on Friday amid protests against a controversial citizenship law that has seen 14 people killed over the last three days and more than 4,000 detained. Six people died yesterday, police said.

Police in India banned public gatherings and continued clampdowns in Muslim-majority regions for a third day amid protests against a controversial citizenship law that saw 14 people killed and more than 4,000 detained.

Internet services were cut as the government attempted to temper unrest across the country, with thousands amassing on the steps of New Delhi’s Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in the country.

Waving Indian flags and shouting anti-government slogans, protesters accused the government of threatening the nation’s secular democracy and marginalising its sizeable Muslim minority.

Similarly large protests took place outside the city’s Jamia Millia Islamia University, the site of violent clashes as students collected signatures demanding the law be scrapped. Students have since accused police of excessive force in the incident, with dozens being seriously injured in the ensuing carnage.

In response to growing unrest authorities erected roadblocks and turned areas around mosques in the Indian capital, Lucknow and other areas frequented by Muslims into security fortresses to prevent widespread demonstrations after Friday prayers.

The unrest was sparked after the government voted to pass India’s contentious citizenship bill – put forward by Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government to offer an easier path to citizenship for religious minorities in neighbouring countries.

Jakob Lindenthal, a 24-year-old exchange student studying a master’s degree in physics, said he took part in two rallies in the southern city of Chennai against the legislation, which discriminates against India’s minority Muslims.

A photo circulated on Twitter showed Mr Lindenthal, who was studying at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras, holding a sign which read: “1933-1945 We have been there,” in an apparent reference to Nazi Germany.

The student said he was summoned to a meeting with India’s immigration authorities on Monday and told he had violated the conditions of his student visa due to his “political activities outside the campus”, and must therefore leave the country.

Mr Lindenthal said during the meeting he was asked for his views on the protests against the new Indian law, which grants citizenship to non-Muslim religious groups fleeing persecution from three Muslim-majority countries.

Speaking from New Delhi while waiting for a flight back to Germany, he said: “I think nobody can claim that I was just there to exploit my student visa to go on anti-government demonstrations and harm the country’s integrity or something. But that was how they presented it to me.”

Chinta Bar, a student collective at IIT, shared a video and images of Mr Lindenthal on Twitter, adding: “ChintaBAR extends solidarity and gratitude to Jakob Lindenthal, for being part of struggles to protect the rights of people in this country and his concern for humanity.”

India’s Home Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while a spokesman for the foreign ministry declined to comment.

The Indian Express newspaper quoted an official at India’s Foreigners Regional Registration Office as saying while he was unaware of Mr Lindenthal’s case, it appeared to be a “clear case” of violating visa rules.

Indian opposition leaders, who accuse Modi’s Hindu nationalist government of strong-armed tactics to muzzle dissent, decried Mr Lindenthal’s expulsion.

Congress lawmaker Shashi Tharoor tweeted: “This is dismaying. We used to be a proud democracy, an example to the world. No democracy punishes freedom of expression.”

At Pondicherry University in southern India, four students boycotted the graduation ceremony on Monday and one refused to accept her gold medal in protest at the citizenship law, according to student council president Parichay Yadav.

India’s ruling party lost a key state election on Monday as it faces massive ongoing anti-government protests against its contentious new citizenship law.

According to results announced late on Monday, prime minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost seats to an alliance forged among the opposition Congress party and powerful regional groups in eastern Jharkhand state, where the voting took place this month.

The election was held amid protests calling for the revocation of the citizenship law, which critics say is the latest effort by Mr Modi’s government to marginalise India’s 200 million Muslims.

BJP leaders said the new citizenship law was not an issue in the Jharkhand election, but Congress party leader RPN Singh said the results were a snub to Mr Modi’s party, which won only 25 of 81 state legislature seats.

The Congress party and its allies won 47 seats, ending the BJP’s five-year rule in the state.

19,Labour MP who chairs Kashmir committee 'treated like criminal and deported' upon arrival at India airport,"A British MP has been refused entry to India after she voiced criticism of the Indian government’s policies in the disputed Kashmir region.

Debbie Abrahams, the Labour MP for Oldham and chair of a parliamentary committee on Kashmir, arrived at Delhi’s international airport shortly before 9am on Monday, but was stopped at immigration and told her e-Visa was no longer valid.

Speaking to The Independent from on board a plane deporting her back to her layover destination of Dubai, Ms Abrahams said blacklisting critical lawmakers from other countries was “the sign of a very unhealthy democracy and everybody should be very concerned”.

India moved in August last year to revoke its portion of Kashmir’s special constitutional status and autonomy, as well as its position as a state, and blocked internet access in a crackdown that, in some parts of the valley, remains in place to this day.

The 59-year-old Ms Abrahams, who was due to visit friends and family in Delhi for two days before flying on to take part in a formal delegation to Pakistan-administered Kashmir, said she believed she was blacklisted over the fact she had “expressed concerns” about the Modi administration’s actions, as well as her onward travel plans.

“I can’t see it not being connected,” she said. Ms Abrahams travelled to India with an e-Visa that permitted her to “attend technical/business meetings”, and was due to expire in October 2020.

During the hours she spent blocked at Delhi airport she was told “not one word” about why she was being refused entry. She said the immigration official who first denied her entry was “rude and aggressive and treated me like a criminal”, but that the many other officials she dealt with had been “very polite and courteous”.

A government source told The Independent that Ms Abrahams “was not in possession of a valid visa to visit India”, adding that “entry into the country was therefore denied”. Separately, the Associated Press quoted an unnamed official as saying the MP had been informed of this prior to travel “in another communication sent to her”.

Ms Abrahams tweeted about her situation while waiting in a room marked as a “deportee cell”, and was met by a large number of critical or abusive replies, purportedly from Indian accounts, saying they were “glad” she was refused entry, calling her a “terrorist sympathiser” and suggesting she could have been “put in prison or shot on sight”.

She defended speaking out about the situation in Kashmir, saying “I think human rights should be the focus of the All Party [Parliamentary] Group [on Kashmir]. We are signatories of the UN Convention on Human Rights and it is every state’s obligation, when we see issues that we are concerned about affecting different populations in a state, that we have to speak out.”

The Indian government is highly sensitive about international criticism of its actions in Kashmir, and in a separate incident on Monday summoned the Turkish ambassador to Delhi over President Tayyip Erdogan's remarks on the disputed region.

During a visit to Pakistan last week, Mr Erdogan said the situation in Indian-administered Kashmir was worsening because of the sweeping changes introduced last August, and that Turkey stood in solidarity with the people of Kashmir.

Foreign ministry spokesman Raveesh Kumar said Mr Erdogan’s comment was “but one more example of a pattern of Turkey interfering in the internal affairs of other countries”. “India finds that completely unacceptable,” he said, adding the episode would “have strong implications for our bilateral relationship”.

It all comes just a day after India lashed out at the UN Secretary General, Antonio Guterres, for offering his own mediation as part of “enhanced dialogue” between Pakistan and India over Kashmir. Both countries administer a portion of the region and claim it in its entirety.

Mr Kumar said on Sunday that Jammu and Kashmir, India’s name for the wider region it administers, “is and will continue to be an integral part of India… further issues, if any, [will] be discussed bilaterally” with Pakistan.

Ms Abrahams plans to stay overnight in Dubai before flying on to Islamabad on Tuesday, saying she would not let the episode with India affect her plans to visit Pakistan.",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/labour-mp-kashmir-india-debbie-abrahams-deported-visa-delhi-airport-a9339306.html,
20,Fury grows after Indian police accused of shooting five Muslim men dead,"Zaheer Ahmed had just returned home from work in northern India last Friday afternoon and stepped out for a smoke before lunch.

Minutes later, he was dead, shot in the head.

His death, and the killing by gunfire of four other Muslim men the same afternoon in the mainly Muslim neighbourhood, made it the most intense burst of violence in two weeks of protests.

India has been convulsed by the broadest unrest in at least seven years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government brought in a law that many see as discriminatory against Muslims, who make up 14 per cent of the population.

All of the families of the five dead men say they were shot and killed by police as a protest flared against the new law. Reuters could not independently verify those accounts, and none of the more than 20 individuals Reuters interviewed saw police open fire.

Police say they used baton charges and teargas, and opened fire to control the crowd but did not kill anyone.

Police add that the men must have been killed by violent armed protesters whose shots went astray. An investigation into the violence is under way.

In the aftermath, distrust and anger between the Muslim community in the area where the deaths happened and security forces has deepened, as protests to the law enter their third week.

The clashes on 20 December erupted around Lisari Gate after Friday afternoon’s Muslim prayers.

Residents say police broke several CCTV cameras in the area before the violence began.

Reuters was unable to independently verify those accounts, but did review CCTV footage from two cameras on shops in the area. In both cases, the footage ends abruptly after a policeman waving a baton is seen trying to hit the cameras.

Akhilesh Singh, the police superintendent of the Meerut City zone, said police had not destroyed any cameras and that all of the victims were involved in what he called rioting.

“Obviously they must be in the midst of the violence. That’s why they must have been killed,” Mr Singh told Reuters.

Police have cracked down on the demonstrations that have spread across India, but Uttar Pradesh state, where Meerut is located, has seen the worst violence. At least 19 of 25 deaths have taken place there.

Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state with roughly 200 million people, is ruled by a Hindu priest and has a history of deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes.

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in a televised statement last week that he would take “revenge” against those behind the violence and make them pay for the public damage.

Zaheer Ahmed’s home lies in a jumble of lanes that make up the crowded Lisari Gate area. The 45-year-old, who sold cattle fodder for a living, had coloured his hair that day for a family wedding, said his 22-year-old niece Shaheen.

When Zaheer returned from work, he told Shaheen that he wanted to smoke and stepped out to go to a small stall in the next lane that sold beedis, the small Indian cigarette.

Zaheer’s friend Naseem Ahmed was standing in the lane across the beedi stall at the time, Mr Ahmed said. He described seeing Ahmed buy the beedi and sit down on a ledge next to the shop.

Around that time, there was chaos on the main road beyond the lanes, Shaheen and several other residents said. They said they could hear the sound of people screaming and saw tear gas clouds. Many men ran into the lanes, some followed by police.

“I suddenly saw Zaheer fall down,” said Mr Ahmed, adding that he had seen some policemen rushing into the lane just before. “I thought he fell unconscious. It all happened within minutes.”

Through the clouds of teargas, Shaheen said she heard someone scream that Ahmed had been shot.

Neighbours brought his body home.

“I don’t know who engaged in the violence, but my husband didn’t,” said his wife Shahajahan. “Why did they kill my innocent husband? How can they kill innocent people?”

The families of the other four men who died that day said the men were either out for work or prayers when they were hit by gunfire. None of them have received post-mortem reports.

According to their families, Mohammed Mohsin was buying fodder for cattle. Asif, a tyre mechanic, had stepped out to fix tyres at someone’s home. Another man called Asif, a rickshaw-driver, was returning home after prayers. Aleem Ansari had gone to the restaurant where he worked making rotis, the Indian bread.

Many people in the impoverished area use just one name.

Thousands of people have taken to streets across India to demand the government rescind the Citizenship Amendment Act enacted by parliament on 11 December.

It gives minorities who migrated from three neighbouring countries a path to citizenship, except for Muslims. Critics say it is an attack on India’s secular foundations.

“He was shot dead by police. They shot him in the head and killed him,” said Ansari’s mother Saira. “I swear if I find that policeman I will not spare him.”

Reuters reviewed a copy of a case report of the violence that day that police registered at the Lisari Gate police station.

The report dated 20 December includes a police officer’s statement that a crowd of about 1,000 protesters armed with sticks charged down the main road at around 2.30pm.

Police asked them to disperse, saying the large gathering was not permitted, according to the police report. The officer who filed it, Ajay Kumar Sharma, did not immediately respond to calls for comment.

“Suddenly there was chaos when the crowd started pelting stones at us and firing at us,” the report says. In response, police used batons and fired teargas and rubber bullets, the statement says.

Mr Singh, the Meerut police superintendent, said the police and paramilitary personnel around Lisari Gate that day were armed with AK-47 rifles, pistols and chilli bombs.

Human Rights Watch has said Indian police have used “unnecessary, deadly force” in controlling the protests.

At a hospital in Meerut, two paramilitary policemen being treated said they were injured when fired at by protesters last Friday. A doctor said they had been treated for bullet injuries on the leg and forearm.

When asked about civilians who had been shot and killed, one of them, Vidya Dhar Shukla, sat up on his bed. “There was so much chaos, who knows where the damned people died?”

“If I had a gun I would fire at them that day,” he said. “India shouldn’t harbour such snakes.”

21,UN human rights chief launches unprecedented legal action against Indian government over citizenship protests,"The UN’s human rights chief has applied to petition India’s supreme court against the Modi administration’s new citizenship laws that critics say discriminate against Muslims, in what is being described as an unprecedented move.

It comes as opposition MPs stalled proceedings in India’s parliament for a second day on Tuesday, demanding an urgent debate on the bloodshed in Delhi last week that saw at least 46 people killed and more than 400 injured.

UN high commissioner for human rights Michelle Bachelet has informed India of her decision to file a brief as an amicus curiae, or third-party “friend of the court”, over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The court has already received more than 140 petitions questioning the constitutional validity of the new law.

Ms Bachelet has previously expressed concerns about the CAA and the violent police crackdown on protesters against the law, which had already claimed lives in Uttar Pradesh state and elsewhere. The mostly anti-Muslim riots in Delhi last week began with clashes between those protesting and counter-protesting over the law.

Ms Bachelet said she was concerned by reports of “police inaction in the face of attacks against Muslims by other groups”. And last month, during her regular update to the UN human rights council, she said the CAA was “of great concern”, adding that “Indians in huge numbers, and from all communities, have expressed – in a mostly peaceful manner – their opposition to the Act, and support for the country’s long tradition of secularism”.

The Modi government is facing mounting calls for home minister Amit Shah’s resignation in the wake of the violence, with police accused of standing by, or in some cases, urging on mobs as mosques and Muslim properties were destroyed. Mr Shah is responsible for policing in the capital.

Yet despite last week’s riots being the deadliest in Delhi since 1984, the government’s top leadership have offered precious little in the way of public comment. Mr Shah did not mention Delhi directly when addressing a rally for the ruling BJP party in West Bengal on Sunday, and Mr Modi has only tweeted, in English, calling for “peace and brotherhood”.

The government has, however, been swift and vociferous in its condemnation of any members of the international community raising concerns over the breakdown in law and order, and particularly the police’s failure to protect Muslims.

Raveesh Kumar, the Indian foreign ministry’s spokesperson, said India’s mission to Geneva was informed of Ms Bachelet’s application to the supreme court on Monday.

He said the CAA was “an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws”. “We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty,” he said.

Earlier on Tuesday, India summoned the Iranian ambassador after Tehran’s foreign minister, Javad Zarif, tweeted that his country “condemns the wave of organised violence against Indian Muslims”.

Iran became the fourth Muslim-majority nation to speak out over the Delhi riots, after Pakistan, Turkey and Indonesia raised their concerns.

The US president Donald Trump failed to do so, despite the fact they were unfolding just across the city from his high-level trade talks with Indian officials. He later told a press conference that handling the riots was “up to India”.

And the UK government also toed a careful line in its response to the riots on Tuesday, during an urgent question raised in parliament by the opposition.

Labour accused India of behaving “like a state with no regard for human rights and the rule of law or the freedom of religion”, adding that it must “face the consequences of its behaviour”.

Shadow foreign office minister Khalid Mahmood described the CAA as “enabling documented migrants from neighbouring countries to seek Indian citizenship provided they meet one condition – they’re not Muslim”. “This is the first such law that has been passed in India since its independence,” he said.

Representing Johnson’s government, the foreign office minister Nigel Adams said the UK was “monitoring closely” developments in India, saying that “the events in Delhi last week were very concerning and the situation is still tense”.

But he failed to specifically criticise the Indian authorities, saying: “The death of one protester is one too many. We urge restraint from all parties and trust the Indian government will address concerns of people of all religions in India.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/delhi-riots-indian-un-human-rights-supreme-court-modi-a9372966.html,
22,Millions of Muslims risk being stripped of citizenship in India and declared 'foreign migrants',"More than 4 million people in India, mostly Muslims, are at risk of being declared foreign migrants as the government pushes a hardline Hindu nationalist agenda that has challenged the country’s pluralist traditions and aims to redefine what it means to be Indian.

The hunt for migrants is unfolding in Assam, a poor, hilly state near the borders with Myanmar and Bangladesh.

Many of the people whose citizenship is now being questioned were born in India and have enjoyed all the rights of citizens, such as voting in elections.

State authorities are rapidly expanding foreigner tribunals and planning to build huge new detention camps.

Hundreds of people have been arrested on suspicion of being a foreign migrant — including a Muslim veteran of the Indian army.

Local activists and lawyers say the pain of being left off a preliminary list of citizens and the prospect of being thrown into jail have driven dozens to suicide.

But the governing party of prime minister Narendra Modi is not backing down.

Instead, it is vowing to bring this campaign to force people to prove they are citizens to other parts of India, part of a far-reaching Hindu nationalist program fuelled by Mr Modi’s sweeping re-election victory in May and his stratospheric popularity.

Members of India’s Muslim minority are growing more fearful by the day.

Assam’s anxiously watched documentation of citizenship — a drive that began years ago and is scheduled to wrap up 31 August — coincides with another setback for Muslims, this one transpiring more than 1,000 miles away.

Less than two weeks ago, Mr Modi unilaterally wiped out the statehood of India’s only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, removing its special autonomy and turning it into a federal territory without any consultation with local leaders — many of whom have since been arrested.

All of the 33 million residents of Assam have had to prove, with documentary evidence, that they or their ancestors were Indian citizens before early 1971, when Bangladesh was established after breaking away from Pakistan.

That is not easy. Many families are racing to get their hands on a decades-old property deed or fraying birth certificate with an ancestor’s name on it.

23,"India invites non-Muslim refugees to become citizens, sparking protests ahead of crunch election","India‘s lower house of parliament has approved a bill that would give citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants, leading to protests that brought the country’s northeast to a standstill.

Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Bill is blatantly anti-Muslim and an attempt by prime minister Narendra Modi‘s Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to boost its votes among Hindus ahead of a general election due by May.

But Home Minister Rajnath Singh denied the bill, which he introduced and must now pass the upper house, was discriminatory.

It would give citizenship rights to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis and several other non-Muslim religious groups who allegedly migrated to India illegally from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

“They have no place to go except India,” Mr Singh told parliament. “The beneficiaries of the bill can reside in any state of the country.”

It sparked protests in Assam, where residents have complained for years that immigrants from Bangladesh have put a strain on resources.

Demonstrators set up blockades with burning tyres and vandalised two BJP offices, disrupting traffic and businesses for much of the day.

Police used tear gas to disperse crowds. Assam police spokesman Mukesh Agarwal said more than 700 demonstrators were arrested.

Protest organiser Samujjal Bhattacharya, a leader of the All Assam Students Union, said the legislation would confer citizenship on the basis of religion, violating India’s secular constitution.

He also said providing residency and citizenship rights to migrants from Bangladesh, with which Assam state shares a long open border, would threaten indigenous communities.

“Already, we have a whole lot of Muslim migrants from Bangladesh who entered Assam illegally over the years,” Mr Bhattacharya said. “Now, the government is trying to make a law seeking to confer citizenship to Hindus from Bangladesh. We want all illegal migrants to be detected and deported, irrespective of their religion.”

The issue of illegal immigration from Bangladesh has spurred periodic public uprisings in Assam since the Indian government granted rights to Bangladeshis who entered the country after winning independence from Pakistan in a 1971 war.

Mr Singh tried to reassure Assam it would not have to bear any burden alone. ”The burden of those persecuted migrants will be shared by the whole country. Assam alone should not have to bear the entire burden,” he said.

However, the bill is unlikely to pass the upper house of parliament, which isn’t controlled by the ruling party. But even if it isn’t passed, the government could pass an ordinance that wouldn’t require the approval of politicians.

Members of religious minorities often face discrimination and sometimes violence at the hands of militant members of Muslim majorities, particularly in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

24,‘Targeted for being Muslim’: Inside the mosque burnt by rioters in worst Delhi violence for decades,"Heat still rises from the blackened debris inside Khursheed’s home as he opens the door, his palms covered in ash from picking his way through what little is left of his belongings with his bare hands.

His was one of around eight homes belonging to Muslims targeted by a rampaging mob in this Delhi neighbourhood on Tuesday afternoon, picked for destruction because they sat next to a mosque in this otherwise mostly Hindu-populated neighbourhood, vandalised, looted and then gutted with fire.

The mosque was also attacked in what has now become a high profile and especially contentious incident amid three days of religious riots that have so far claimed at least 24 lives.

Khursheed said around 400 people came to the Ashok Nagar neighbourhood in the morning and started attacking Muslim properties. Police officers rescued the residents and escorted them to a nearby station for their own safety but, outnumbered, retreated as the vandalism of the mosque began.

“Look at my home, the whole thing is burnt, as well as all our possessions – clothes, utensils – everything,” he said. “There were 11 of us living here, what do I do now? Where will we go?”

Videos then went viral of men chanting the Hindu nationalist slogan “Jai Shri Ram” (glory to Lord Ram) as the mosque was vandalised and two flags, one of India and the other showing the Hindu deity Lord Hanuman, were hoisted on its tallest minaret.

Due to confusion over the name of the neighbourhood, the Delhi police mistakenly said on Twitter that this mosque had not been targeted and that the videos were “misinformation”, prompting the major right-wing channel Times Now to run unquestioningly a prime-time segment denouncing the “fake” footage – and those sharing it – on TV.

Yet the buildings around the mosque were still smoking when The Independent met with the Muslim victims of the attack on Wednesday, as well as the Hindu neighbours who tried to protect them from the mob of “outsiders”.

Khursheed, who works driving a battery-powered autorickshaw, said he does not blame Hindus for what happened, but rather the heightened tensions created by the Modi government’s new citizenship laws. Critics say the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), and a planned National Register of Citizens (NRC), discriminate against Muslims and threaten India’s secular constitution.

He and other residents said they didn’t recognise the attackers. “I don’t know the people who came and did this – it is all just politics,” he said. “I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in.”

Parveen, another resident, said she had lived in her home in Ashok Nagar for 25 years. Yet seeing it gutted by fire was still not as painful as what the rioters did to the adjacent mosque.

“We were targeted because we are Muslim,” she said. “All the shops belonging to Muslims were burnt, while none of the Hindu shops were touched. They want to single us out, to separate us from the other religions.”

She said Hindus and Muslims in the neighbourhood had “never had any problems”.

“We have always prayed together, Hindus and Muslims, in mosques and temples. We have always believed that we are all equal.”

Like the other residents, Parveen says she bears no ill feelings for her Hindu neighbours, saying that when the mob first came from outside “they tried to save us”.

I am just very sad for the situation my family is now in Khursheed, resident

But she says she doesn’t know whether the situation will calm down across the city after what happened. She is just thankful she wasn’t home to see the mosque attacked. “It is totally broken and burnt, we feel worse about that than what happened to our own homes. We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing.”

A little down the road from the burnt-out mosque, shattered shop fronts and piles of debris, a group of Hindu neighbours watch the clear-up and are nervous about speaking to the media.

A 39-year-old man, who asked not to be named, said he welcomed prime minister Narendra Modi’s call for calm on Wednesday afternoon, but that it should have come on Monday.

He admits the situation is “very tense”.

“We have always been living together amicably here, there was no tension, we spent our childhoods together. Now these outsiders have come in and this has happened, and it is the people living here who have to deal with the tension.”

He points to four armed police officers sitting outside the burnt-out mosque. “At least there is some protection now, but we were expecting it earlier. There should have been some procedure in place,” he said

For some, though, the four officers provide little comfort. A Muslim man whose house across the road from the mosque was burnt, who did not give his name, said the violence had turned into “the most terrible outcome possible” for this neighbourhood.

We were so surprised when we heard they targeted the mosque, we never thought that people could be capable of such a thing Parveen, resident

“The situation is calmer today but it could still turn turbulent [again]. I see [almost] no police here, no big deployment, nothing. I am obviously worried – surely there must be a heavy deployment of police at a place where a mosque has been demolished?”

Clearly nervous, he says he is only returning briefly to retrieve any key documents that – he hopes – may have survived the fire. “All the documents, all the possessions we have, we had to just leave them behind and just run for our lives,” he said. “If they are not there, how will I get a job? These attacks are not just damaging property, they are ruining people’s lives.”",https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/muslim-hindu-clashes-latest-mosque-burnt-delhi-a9361601.html,
25,India effectively strips 4m people of their citizenship in northern Assam region,"India has effectively stripped 4 million people from the state of Assam of their citizenship.

The state has a National Register of Citizens (NRC), which includes the names of all those who can prove they came to the state before 24 March 1971 – the day before Bangladesh declared independence.

India has now released a final draft of a list of its citizens, leaving some 4 million people to prove their Indian nationality.

It says hundreds of thousands of people have illegally entered the country from neighbouring Bangladesh over decades and settled down in the northeast – a claim which Bangladesh rejects.

The application process for inclusion in India’s national register started in 2015. Of the 32.9 million applicants, the names of 28.9 million have been approved and included in the draft, India’s registrar-general Sailesh told reporters in Gauhati, the capital of Assam state.

Mr Sailesh said more than 4 million who have been left out can file appeals by 30 September and prove their Indian nationality by providing documents – until then, no one will be declared an illegal migrant.

“Adequate and ample scope will be given to people for making objections. No genuine Indian citizen should have any fear,” Mr Sailesh said.

Allegations of illegal movement of people from India’s border with Bangladesh have triggered sectarian tensions between the state’s indigenous population and Bengali-speaking Muslims.

Hundreds of Bengali-speaking Muslims whose nationalities are suspect are living in detention camps in Assam state.

26,Jamia suspends professor who said he won’t pass ‘non-Muslim’ students for supporting CAA,"The Jamia professor said he had been “misinterpreted” and that “it was a sarcastic and imaginary tweet.” The Jamia professor said he had been “misinterpreted” and that “it was a sarcastic and imaginary tweet.”

Jamia Millia Islamia has suspended an assistant professor who tweeted that he had passed all his students except 15 “non-Muslim” students for supporting the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). The teacher, however, later claimed the tweet was “sarcastic” and “misinterpreted”.

Assistant Professor Abrar Ahmad, who teaches electrical engineering at the university, had tweeted Wednesday morning: “All my students are passed except 15 non-Muslims, who have to reappear #CAA. If you have #CAAprotests, I have 55 students in my favour #CAAsupport. Majority will teach you lesson if protests not ends #riot (sic).”

Dr. Abrar Ahmad, Asstt Professor of @jmiu_official tweeted in public domain as to failing 15 non-muslim students in an exam. This is a serious misconduct inciting communal disharmony under CCS CONDUCT RULES.The university suspends him pending inquiry.@DrRPNishank @HRDMinistry — Jamia Millia Islamia (Central University) (@jmiu_official) March 25, 2020

After it attracted criticism, Ahmad tweeted, “Regarding a post I wrote about an examination discrimination is parody to explain #CAA and #CAAprotests (and) how government is discriminating a community. There has been no such examination and no such results… It is just to explain an issue…”

At 12.30 am on Thursday, Jamia tweeted from its official handle, tagging the Human Resource Development Minister, saying Ahmad had been suspended pending enquiry. “Dr Abrar Ahmad, Asst Professor. tweeted in public domain as to failing 15 non-Muslim students… This is a serious misconduct inciting communal disharmony under CCS CONDUCT RULES. The university suspends him pending inquiry,” it said.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Ahmad claimed he had been “misinterpreted”. “It was a sarcastic tweet. I wanted to say that the way the government is targeting minorities in the name of CAA — by targeting those protesting against it — is wrong. Just like it would be wrong if I fail the non-Muslim students in my class…if they protest against it,” he claimed.

“In this session, exams have still not taken place. In the previous semester, I taught two M.Tech classes, in which all students have been passed. This was a misunderstanding. Anyway, the university has set up an inquiry, so everything will become clear now,” said Ahmad.

The Jamia unit of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) hit out at Ahmad for his tweet, saying he had “shamed the pious profession of teaching”.

“A prominent university like Jamia Millia Islamia has no place for a bigoted teacher like Dr Abrar who spews the venom of communalism to poison the minds of students dependent on him for their education,” said ABVP Jamia president Shubham Rai.

In view of the growing scare of coronavirus across the country, students of Jamia Millia Islamia on Saturday suspended their sit-in protest against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act outside the university gate number 7.

“With a heavy heart but with great hope in our hearts, we temporarily suspend the ongoing 24 hours sit-in protest at Gate no. 7, JMI and appeal to all protestors to kindly take the situation with utmost seriousness and save themselves and other from this fatal illness,” a statement from Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) said on the 100th day of the sit-in.

It also appealed the Centre to “immediately” suspend the exercise of National Population Register.

The JCC, comprising JMI students and alumni, was formed after alleged police brutality on the campus on December 15.

The varsity put forth a list of demands including, the release of all political prisoners immediately, withdrawing the Foreigners (Tribunal) Amendment Order, 2019, withdrawing all instructions for construction of detention camps and release of all people in those camps after testing them for COVID-19.

“Our fight against the CAA, NRC and the NPR remains uncompromising,” JCC said.

In order to combat the coronavirus spread, the JCC also asked the Centre to undertake adequate monetary and policy measures, adding that doctors need proper medical infrastructure such as safety gear and testing kits more than appreciation and heroism.

“In 1947, when our campus was burnt during riots, it did not stop the students and teachers of our university from working relentlessly in refugee camps all over India. The university could be fixed later, but humanity must be fixed first,” JCC said.

28,"Din in Maharashtra House as BJP tries to expose cracks in Sena-NCP-Cong alliance over CAA, NPR","Fadnavis said there was no provision in the CAA to take away anyone’s citizenship, but a “misinformation campaign” had been undertaken against it. Fadnavis said there was no provision in the CAA to take away anyone’s citizenship, but a “misinformation campaign” had been undertaken against it.

RUCKUS PREVAILED in the Maharashtra Assembly on Saturday as BJP attempted to expose the cracks in the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and the National Population Register (NPR).

A discussion on the budgetary grants for 2020-21 was disrupted after the Treasury and the Opposition benches locked horns over the issue. Saturday was the last day of the current session, which has been curtailed amid the spread of Covid-19.

Trouble erupted in the House after Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, while discussing budgetary grants, accused “some of the ministers” in the state of stoking fear among minorities.

Fadnavis said there was no provision in the CAA to take away anyone’s citizenship, but a “misinformation campaign” had been undertaken against it.

“It is the responsibility of the state government to clear the air in this regard. But some ministers of the government are themselves stoking fear and spreading confusion. How are they being allowed to speak out against a national legislation? The government must gag them against the same,” said Fadnavis.

Senior ministers, especially those belonging to NCP and Shiv Sena, repeatedly interrupted Fadnavis’ speech, contending that a discussion on CAA was beyond the scope of the discussion.

“This is an independent issue. It has nothing to do with budgetary grants,” said Home Minister Anil Deshmukh.

When Fadnavis argued that the “rumours being spread” had created a law and order issue, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Anil Parab, who belongs to Sena, countered. “Riots have taken place in BJP-ruled states. We haven’t seen a single incident. You (BJP) are trying to pollute the atmosphere in the state,” he said.

NCP’s Nawab Malik and Chaggan Bhujbal later read out legislative rules, seeking the chair’s ruling that Fadnavis should not be permitted to speak over the issue. The din in the house intensified after Bhujbal made an “objectionable” remark, with the BJP members storming into the well.

Assembly Speaker Nana Patole adjourned the House for 30 minutes. During the break, group leaders of all parties held a meeting. When the proceedings resumed, Patole ruled that “objectionable” remarks made on both sides stood expunged.

While he ruled that Fadnavis shouldn’t speak on the issue further, the Opposition leader concluded his speech criticising the coalition for not acting against former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid, alleging that the latter, while addressing a gathering in Amravati, had exhorted people to come out on the streets during US President Donald Trump’s recent visit to India.

29,No NRC,"The Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens, and the National Population Register are governed by separate processes and purposes. The Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens, and the National Population Register are governed by separate processes and purposes.

Responding to the discussion in the House on the communal violence in Delhi in Rajya Sabha on Thursday, Union Home Minister Amit Shah seemed to be taking a step back from his government’s unyielding line on the NPR-NRC issue that forms its backdrop. No one would be marked “doubtful” in case he or she is unable to provide the information sought in the impending National Population Register process, he said, all information is voluntary, no document would be sought and nobody should fear the NPR. He assured members of the Opposition that he was open and ready for discussions with them on the matter. In effect, Minister Shah seemed to be reaching out, for the first time, to meet the criticism and apprehensions that data collected under the NPR would be weaponised subsequently by the NRC, that the former was a prelude to the latter, which would result, due to state malevolence or incapacity or both, as in Assam, in vulnerable citizens losing their citizenship. Minister Shah’s assurance is welcome, but it isn’t enough. In the House on Thursday, he could have gone further, taken another step back. He could have said that there will be no NRC.

The Citizenship Amendment Act, the National Register of Citizens, and the National Population Register are governed by separate processes and purposes. Yet they have come to be linked with each other, in popular fear and imagination — and, before that, in the politics of the BJP. In fact, the citizenship law gives, doesn’t take away, citizenship. But in tandem with the proposed nation-wide NRC, it is seen to be holding out a legal safety net to Hindus caught on the wrong foot by the NRC, while underlining the helplessness of Muslims in the same predicament. In fact, the NPR only collects data. But in the verification process of the NRC that follows, it could hand the power to decide who is a citizen, and who isn’t, to a local official. In other words, the NRC is the nub of the fears and doubts that have collected around both the CAA and NPR.

The CAA is now in the Supreme Court, which will decide on its constitutionality. But it is in the government’s hands to strike out the idea of the nationwide NRC. At Ramlila maidan in December, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that a nationwide NRC was not being discussed in government circles. President Ram Nath Kovind’s address that flagged off the Budget session made no mention of the NRC. Now, the Home Minister, who has on several occasions spoken of the NRC and CAA in the same breath, has sought to allay the fears sparked by them ahead of the NPR. But both the PM and the home minister should recognise that in the climate of their party and government’s making, in which those who have genuine questions about being left out of the NRC are called “anti-national” or painted as “misled”, nothing less than a recall of the idea of a nationwide NRC will do. Admittedly, it is in the BJP’s election manifesto but, surely, the prime minister’s commitment of sabka vishwas should over-ride that.

30,Amit Shah on NPR: No one to be marked D (doubtful)… telling you as Home Minister,"Amit Shah at Parliament on Thursday. Express Amit Shah at Parliament on Thursday. Express

On the day Tamil Nadu became the newest addition to the list of states opposed to the National Population Register exercise which is due to start weeks from now, Union Home Minister Amit Shah assured Parliament Thursday that no participant in the process will be marked ‘doubtful’ in case he or she is unable to provide the information sought.

Reaching out to the Opposition saying he is always ready for a discussion on the issue of NPR and the Citizenship Amendment Act, Shah, speaking during a short-duration debate in Rajya Sabha on the Delhi law and order situation, said no document is being sought during the NPR process, and no verification of citizenship is being done. He asked the Opposition to support the government, and said nobody in the country should “fear” the NPR.

On the Opposition charge that citizenship rules have a provision to mark a citizen as “D” or doubtful in the NPR process, Shah told Congress member Kapil Sibal: “Let me say, now that we are sitting face to face… support us now. I say it clearly: First, no document will be asked for NPR. Second, any information that you don’t have, you don’t have to share that. And third, I say it on the floor of Rajya Sabha as Home Minister, nobody will be marked D.”

“No document is being asked. All information is voluntary. Whatever information a participant wants to share will be recorded,” he said.

Explained With the NPR process due to start, Shah sought to blunt opposition to it over apprehensions regarding citizenship. His offer to engage with the Opposition is the first formal reachout following the din over the NPR-NRC process. While he may have sought to clear some of the lingering doubts, the NRC issue still hangs in the air.

Taking note of the assurance, Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad asked Shah: “If I heard correctly, the Home Minister is saying that nobody will have a D against them, is that right?”. At this, Shah said: “Yes”. He said if any member of the Opposition has any doubt, he will discuss it on priority. The discussion on NPR began after Shah asked Sibal under which part of the CAA can someone lose citizenship. Sibal said, “Nobody is saying that CAA will snatch anyone’s citizenship. We are not saying that.” At this, the treasury benches erupted, saying this had always been the line of the Congress.

Sibal then said, “the law says that when NPR will happen, during NPR ten more questions will be asked and the enumerator… he will go and ask, and will put a D against the person, and an inquiry will be initiated.” He said it is not just against “Muslims” but also against the “poor” and the Dalits as many will not have documents.

Shah’s assurance comes in the backdrop of several state governments opposing the NPR process in its 2020 form — their opposition is over questions seeking details on the date and place of birth of an individual’s parents and last residence, and the fear that failure to answer these questions would make them ‘deemed doubtful’ for the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) process. More so, when Shah himself, in public utterances in the past, has spoken of a nationwide NRC.

While Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Puducherry, Bihar (where BJP rules with JD-U) and Andhra Pradesh have all passed resolutions against NPR, states such as Odisha and Telangana have reservations on the questions relating to details of parents in the NPR form.

On Thursday, Shah appeared to be putting a stamp of authority on what his junior minister had said indirectly in Parliament last month. On February 4, in reply to a question by Congress leader Manish Tewari on the ‘doubtful’ issue, MoS Home Nityanand Rai, in a written reply in Lok Sabha, said: “During the updation of National Population Register, no verification is done to find individuals whose citizenship is doubtful.”

According to Citizenship Rules, verification of NPR data will begin only when the process for NRC starts. The NPR process will collect data of all “usual residents” of the country in a house-to-house census and then, during the process of NRC, verification of these details would be done and doubtful citizens would be marked. Notably, under Citizenship Rules, 2003, NPR is part of the NRC process.

According to Rule 4 (Preparation of the National Register of Indian Citizens) of the Citizenship Rules, 2003: “For the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the Local Register of Indian Citizens, the particulars collected of every family and individual in the Population Register shall be verified and scrutinized by the Local Registrar… During the verification process, particulars of such individuals, whose Citizenship is doubtful, shall be entered by the Local Registrar with appropriate remark in the Population Register for further enquiry and in case of doubtful Citizenship, the individual or the family shall be informed in a specified proforma immediately after the verification process is over.”

The rule says “The Central Government shall, for the purpose of National Register of Indian Citizens, cause to carry throughout the country a house-to-house enumeration for collection of specified particulars relating to each family and individual, residing in a local area including the Citizenship status.”

31,Those who preach for refugees’ rights are opposing CAA meant for refugees: PM Modi,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his government’s decision to amend the citizenship act Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his government’s decision to amend the citizenship act

Facing criticism from within and outside the country over the amended citizenship law, Prime Minister Narendra Modi Friday hit out at those who “preach for rights of refugees the world over” but are opposing the CAA that is giving citizenship to persecuted minorities of neighbouring nations.

Speaking at the Global Business Summit in New Delhi, Modi underlined his government’s “conviction to break status quo”, while defending contentious laws, including the Triple Talaq, abrogating Article 370 and amending the Citizenship Act.

The Citizenship Amendment Act was passed by the Parliament last year, resulting in a series of protests across the country.

“There is nothing wrong with talking the right things. But these people have a particular hatred for people who are doing the right things,” he said. “So when changes are brought in status quo, they see this as disruptions,” he was quoted as saying by PTI.

According to the CAA, members of the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan who entered India before December 31, 2014 will get Indian citizenship. Critics have argued that the Act is unconstitutional as it makes religion criteria for citizenship. Combined with the proposed nationwide NRC, the Act has been accused of being discriminatory against Muslims.

In January this year, more than a month after the CAA was passed leading Bangladesh to cancel at least two ministerial visits to India, Prime Minister Hasina had said that while the CAA and NRC were “internal matters” of India, the CAA was “not necessary”.

On Saturday, Indonesia became the latest country to convey its concerns over the deadly riots in Delhi that were triggered by clashes over the amended Act. The Indonesian foreign ministry’s statement came hours after that country’s religious affairs ministry uncharacteristically issued a statement condemning the sectarian “violence against Muslims” in India.

At least 53 people have died in Delhi in communal clashes that spiralled over protests against the CAA. The US has urged India to “protect and respect” the right to peaceful assembly of people and hold accountable those perpetrating violence following the riots in Delhi.

Meanwhile, the Indian government has been emphasising that the new law will not deny citizenship rights, but it has been brought to protect the oppressed minorities of neighbouring countries and give them citizenship.

Last month, the Ministry of External Affairs Thursday said that India has reached out to countries across all geographic regions on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Several Opposition ruled states, including Kerala, Punjab, West Bengal, have said they will not implement the new law, and a clutch of petitions wanting it to be struck down are before the Supreme Court. While the government has toned down its rhetoric on NRC, Home Minister Amit Shah has said it will not budge on CAA.

32,"CAA raises human rights issues, we will intervene in Supreme Court, says UN body","India reacted sharply and underlined that the CAA was an “internal matter of India” and “no foreign party has any locus standi” on issues pertaining to its sovereignty. India reacted sharply and underlined that the CAA was an “internal matter of India” and “no foreign party has any locus standi” on issues pertaining to its sovereignty.

In an unprecedented departure, the office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet Jeria, has informed India’s Permanent Mission at the UN in Geneva that she “intends to file” an intervention application in the Supreme Court on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act because an “examination of the CAA in the present case raises important issues with respect to international human rights law and its application to migrants, including refugees”.

Through the application, the UN Commissioner “seeks to intervene as amicus curiae (third-party) in this case, by virtue of her mandate to inter alia protect and promote all human rights and to conduct necessary advocacy in that regard, established pursuant to the United Nations General Assembly resolution 48/141.”

India reacted sharply and underlined that the CAA was an “internal matter of India” and “no foreign party has any locus standi” on issues pertaining to its sovereignty.

While the Ministry of External Affairs’ spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the Permanent Mission in Geneva was informed Monday evening by the UN Commissioner for Human Rights that her Office had filed an Intervention Application, the United Nations Information Centre in Delhi told The Indian Express she “intends to file” the application in the next couple of days, and had informed the Indian government, in advance.

“We are clear that the CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of our constitutional values. It is reflective of our long-standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of the Partition of India,” the MEA spokesperson said. Stressing that India is a democratic country governed by the rule of law, he said, “We all have utmost respect for and full trust in our independent judiciary. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position would be vindicated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.”

The Supreme Court is hearing a batch of pleas challenging the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The intervention application has been made on a petition filed by former diplomat Deb Mukharji. He had served as Indian envoy to Bangladesh in the past.

There is no known precedent of the UN moving the Supreme Court in India in the recent past. A Special Rapporteur of the United Nations had filed an intervention application before the Supreme Court last week, seeking to assist the Court in the matter concerning deportation of Rohingyas from India. In the case of foreign governments, the Italian envoy was made a party at the Italian marines case.

In her application, Michelle Bachelet Jeria said the High Commissioner is the principal human rights official of the United Nations. “The High Commissioner’s role is thus to promote adherence to international human rights law and, with this purpose in mind, to support domestic courts, with their constitutional or judicial function, in ensuring the implementation of international legal obligations,” the application said.

The application said the “examination of the CAA in the present case raises important issues with respect to international human rights law and its application to migrants, including refugees”.

“The examination by the Honourable Court of the CAA is of substantial interest to the High Commissioner, considering its potential implications for the application and interpretation of India’s international human rights obligations, including the right to equality before the law and the prohibition of discrimination as well as the CAA’s impact on the protection of human rights of migrants, including refugees in India,” it said.

It also said “special attention” is given to the core international human rights treaties to which India is a State party, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), the International Covenant on Economic Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), the International Covenant on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (ICERD), the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW).

33,Five foreigners asked to leave India for CAA protests: Govt in Lok Sabha,"Union minister Nityanand Rai. (File Photo) Union minister Nityanand Rai. (File Photo)

As many as five foreigners have been asked to leave India for participating in anti-CAA protests, the government informed the Lok Sabha on Tuesday. The foreigners have been asked to leave on the ground that they violated their visa conditions by engaging in an activity that could be defined as political, sources said.

Responding to a question in this regard, Union Minister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai said, “As reported by the Bureau of Immigration, five foreign nationals who violated visa norms by participating in the anti-CAA protests were asked to leave India.”

The amended citizenship law has triggered protests across the country. According to the new law, Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian immigrants who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan will be given Indian citizenship with December 31, 2014 as the cut-off date.

The government also told the Lok Sabha on Tuesday that it was holding discussions with all States over the NPR exercise which is scheduled to begin along with the houselisting phase of the Census on April 1.

“The government is in discussion with the States having concerns in regard to the preparation of NPR. The demographic and other particulars of each family and individual are to be updated/collected during the exercise of updation of NPR. No document is to be collected during this exercise,” Rai said in his reply to a written question.

Explained: Why a UN body intends to intervene in a Supreme Court case against CAA

Home Ministry sources said the Central government is already reaching out to allay the apprehensions of States by meeting Chief Ministers critical of the exercise. Punjab, Kerala, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh are some of the non-BJP ruled states which have apprehensions about the NPR and are critical of the exercise.

As part of the Centre’s outreach, Registrar General and Census Commissioner Vivek Joshi recently met Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and apprised him of the preparations for the Census and NPR. Punjab Assembly has adopted a resolution expressing its opposition to the CAA. Joshi, who will supervise the Census and NPR exercise, is expected to meet Chief Ministers of all states critical of the NPR, sources said.

Several states, including Kerala, have said they will cooperate with the Census exercise but not NPR.

Sources said the RGI is also looking at roping in celebrities to allay fears about the NPR exercise. The government is also asking various government departments to carry out an awareness campaign on NPR.

34,"UN Human Rights chief to move SC over CAA, India calls it ‘internal matter’","The Citizenship (Amendment) Act introduced and passed by Parliament in December last year sparked protests across the country. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act introduced and passed by Parliament in December last year sparked protests across the country.

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights “intends to file” an Intervention Application in the Supreme Court of India over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. India, which was informed about this on Monday evening, said that CAA was an “internal matter” and that it is a “long-standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of Partition.”

Reacting to the same, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement, “The Citizenship Amendment Act is an internal matter of India and concerns the sovereign right of the Indian Parliament to make laws. We strongly believe that no foreign party has any locus standi on issues pertaining to India’s sovereignty.”

“We are clear that CAA is constitutionally valid and complies with all requirements of our constitutional values. It is reflective of our long-standing national commitment in respect of human rights issues arising from the tragedy of Partition of India,” the statement further added. “India is a democratic country governed by the rule of law. We all have utmost respect for and full trust in our independent judiciary. We are confident that our sound and legally sustainable position would be vindicated by the Hon’ble Supreme Court,” MEA Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act passed by Parliament in December last year sparked protests across the country. The citizenship law expedites granting of citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Jains and Parsis — it leaves out Muslims — who entered the country from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan until December 31, 2014.

The Supreme Court is currently hearing petitions filed by activists, opposition members, against the amended Citizenship Act.

Unfazed by the criticism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, last month said the government stands by the decision “despite all pressure”. “For years, India had been waiting for decisions like repealing Article 370 and the introduction of CAA. These decisions were necessary in the interest of the country. Despite all the pressure, we stood our ground over these decisions and will remain so,” Modi said while addressing a public meeting in Varanasi.

Several opposition ruled states across have also raised their concern against the CAA and said they will not implement the new citizenship law. Various states in India including Bengal, Bihar, Punjab, Kerala have passed resolutions against CAA. Violent clashes over the law also broke out in Delhi last week, killing 47 people and injuring over 250.

35,Gujarat: Dalits seek release of people held for CAA protests,"Protests against CAA at Shah e Alam area in Ahmedabad in December 2019. (File) Protests against CAA at Shah e Alam area in Ahmedabad in December 2019. (File)

Months after violent protests erupted in Chhapi area of Banaskantha against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), in which 51 people were arrested, mostly from Muslim community, the Dalit community of Banaskantha demanded relief for the accused, stating that many from respectable families have been languishing in jail for the past two months.

Dalit community leaders have approached the Banaskantha administration and police, demanding faster probe and filing of chargesheet in the case so that the 51 people locked up in Palanpur sub-jail can seek bail. They claimed that among the arrested accused, many are respectable businessmen and veteran farmers, who never had a criminal record and their livelihood was getting affected. In this regard, dozens of Dalit community leaders from 8 talukas of Banaskantha met the district collector and superintendent of police and submitted a memorandum.

“Many among those who have been arrested are senior citizens, businessmen, hoteliers and farmers. There might be some anti-social people who may have resorted to violence but those who have been arrested have no criminal record and they belong to respectable families. They were arrested for December 19 protests, and the police have not been able to file a charge sheet even though two months have passed. We want the police to complete their investigation so that those who are innocent can at least apply for bail,” said Dalpat Bhatia, president, Banaskantha Dalit Adhikar Manch.

“The Dalit community in Gujarat has always stood in support of any mariginalised group and we keep working for the welfare of all. Many in the Chhapi violence case are locked up in jail on wrong charges and they must get a fair chance for bail,” said Nanjibhai Hadiyal, another Dalit leader from Palanpur in Banaskantha.

The case dates back to December 19 last year when hundreds of people had assembled at a public ground in Chhapi to protest against CAA and NRC, without police permission. The protest had then turned violent and videos had surfaced in which the crowd could be seen attacking a police vehicle.

Taking cognisance, police initially booked 22 people and later 51, under Indian Penal Code (IPC) sections pertaining to conspiracy (120 B), attempt to culpable homicide (308), endangering life (336), 390 (loot), unlawful assembly (143, 149), rioting (147, 153), assault and obstruction to public servants (152, 353) and criminal intimidation (506(2)). The accused have also been charged under provisions of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act.

From December 20 to 26 last year, 49 people were arrested in this matter and later on February 10 this year, two more were held, taking the count to 51. The accused were first sent to 10-day police custody and later sent to Palanpur sub-jail. Dalit activists also alleged that the police have framed many persons for merely witnessing the protests on December 19.

“Police have applied stringent and arbitrary sections against those who have had absolutely no criminal record in the past. For example, on December 19, the protesters had blocked a private bus and tried to snatch the keys from the driver as a way of chakka jam. However, the police have also applied section of loot in the FIR even though nothing happened to the bus. There was no intention of protestors to cause violence and among the accused there are many who are old and sick,” said Satish Rajpal, another Dalit leader from Banaskantha.

The Jamat-e-Ulema Hind faction of Banaskantha has now decided to approach the state Home Minister to seek relief for those locked in jail.

“Among those who are locked, many are hoteliers, restaurant owners, workers in garage, factories and mill. The livelihood of these people are at risk if they are not allowed to work on a daily basis. The police have relied on video footage to make the arrests, however, they have picked up anyone who was seen in that area on December 19. Many had only assembled to witness the protests and did not indulge in anyviolence. The protestors were neither given permission to protest nor the government approached them for a dialogue.

I am happy that our Dalit brothers have come forward to help us and we will soon approach the state home minister, Pradipsinh Jadeja, in this case,” said Atiqur Rahaman, secretary, Jamat-e-Ulema Hind Banaskantha.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Tarun Duggal, Superintendent of Police Banaskantha said, “Police are investigating this case as per procedure and we have not filed the charge sheet yet. We received the memorandum from the Dalit community leaders.”

Indonesia on Saturday conveyed its concerns over the deadly riots in Delhi that were triggered by clashes over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). On Sunday, Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla will travel to Bangladesh, the first high-level visit to that country since the CAA-NRC issue introduced strains in an otherwise robust bilateral relationship.

The Indonesian foreign ministry called in the Indian Ambassador to Jakarta, Pradeep Rawat, on Friday to discuss the riots that have claimed 42 lives so far, The Jakarta Post reported on Saturday.

“The Government of Indonesia has complete confidence that the Government of India will be able to manage the situation and ensure the harmonious relations among its religious communities. Moreover, both countries share similar characteristics, as pluralistic countries that uphold democratic values and tolerance,” the Indonesian foreign ministry said, according to the newspaper.

The Indonesian foreign ministry’s statement came hours after that country’s religious affairs ministry uncharacteristically issued a statement condemning the sectarian “violence against Muslims” in India.

Shringla, who has earlier served as India’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh, will be in Dhaka on March 1-2 to meet the Bangladesh leadership. His main task will be related to laying the groundwork for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s likely visit to Bangladesh for the birth centenary celebrations of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s father and Bangladesh’s Father of the Nation Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.

The event is expected to be held on March 17 — the Bangabandhu’s 100th birth anniversary — and is likely to be attended by, apart from Modi, former President Pranab Mukherjee and Congress president Sonia Gandhi.

In January this year, more than a month after the CAA was passed leading Bangladesh to cancel at least two ministerial visits to India, Prime Minister Hasina had said that while the CAA and NRC were “internal matters” of India, the CAA was “not necessary”.

In an interview to Gulf News in Abu Dhabi, she had said that she did not understand the purpose of the CAA, which offers a faster route to Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities who have faced persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

“We don’t understand why [the Indian government] did it. It was not necessary,” Hasina said.

In December, Bangladesh’s Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen and Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan cancelled their visits to India after Parliament passed the CAA, sparking strong reactions in Dhaka. Both ministers cited scheduling commitments for not being able to visit.

Momen has said that the new citizenship law could weaken India’s secular character, and has rejected suggestions that minorities are facing religious persecution in his country. MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar had clarified at the time that there was no religious persecution under the “present government” of Bangladesh, but had happened under the “previous government” and “military rule”.

37,"10 stabbed in Shillong, toll 2 in anti-CAA unrest in state","The government has announced a curfew in “Shillong agglomeration and its adjoining areas” till March 1 morning. (Representational image) The government has announced a curfew in “Shillong agglomeration and its adjoining areas” till March 1 morning. (Representational image)

In fresh violence in Meghalaya believed to be related to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, a group of unidentified people went on a stabbing spree in Shilliong’s busiest market on Saturday, attacking “non-indigenous” people, leaving one dead and nine injured. Clashes were also reported from Shillong’s Jaiaw and Langsning, and Sohra (Cherrapunji) town’s Iew Sohra market, leaving at least two non-tribals injured.

On Friday, a local taxi driver was killed in Ichamati area in East Khasi Hills district, close to the Bangladesh border, in clashes between members of the Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) and non-tribals.

The government has announced a curfew in “Shillong agglomeration and its adjoining areas” till March 1 morning. Two companies of Central Armed Police Forces have already arrived while six more are reportedly on the way.

A release by Assistant Inspector General of Police, Meghalaya, GK Ïangrai on the attack at Bara Bazaar, among Shillong’s oldest markets, said all those stabbed were rushed to Civil Hospital. Rupchand Dewan, 29, from Assam’s Barpeta district, died on the way. Superintendent of Police Claudia Lyngwa told PTI that those behind the attack are yet to be identified.

In Langsning, 21-year-old Akash Ali was assaulted, while in Sohra, an unidentified non-tribal was beaten up by locals. Both are in hospital. The number of those injured in the clashes has gone up to 16, Lyngwa said.

The death in Ichamati, of Lurshai Hynniewta (35), followed a KSU meeting to discuss the CAA and demanding implementation of the Inner Line Permit (ILP). Large parts of Meghalaya are exempt from the CAA, as practically the entire state falls under the ambit of the Sixth Schedule. The ILP, a document that regulates the entry of non-locals, has been a long-standing demand of different tribal groups of Meghalaya. In December, after the CAA was passed, a one-day-special Meghalaya Assembly session unanimously adopted a resolution asking the government to implement the ILP.

Eight people have been arrested based on an FIR filed by the KSU following the incident.

A release from the office of the District Magistrate of East Khasi Hills said there was “apprehension of serious deterioration of law and order in Shillong”. Mobile Internet services continue to remain suspended in West Jaintia Hills, East Jaintia Hills, East Khasi Hills, Ri Bhoi, West Khasi Hills and South West Khasi Hills districts, while SMSes have been limited to five per day.

Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma appealed to people to refrain from violence and ensure peace. A release from the Chief Minister’s Office said, “The government has taken all measures to maintain law and order.” Ex-gratia of Rs 2 lakh has been announced for next of kin of the deceased.

38,Polish student at Jadavpur University asked to leave India,"Students and teachers of Jadavpur University in Kolkata take part in a protest march against the attack on JNU students, on Monday. (Photo: Partha Paul) Students and teachers of Jadavpur University in Kolkata take part in a protest march against the attack on JNU students, on Monday. (Photo: Partha Paul)

A Polish student of Comparative Literature in Kolkata’s Jadavpur University has been sent a notice by the Foreign Regional Registration Office (FRRO), under the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, and asked to leave the country, according to information.

While the student concerned, Kamil Siedcynski, refused to interact with the media in this regard, students at the university said he was sent the notice most likely for participating in rallies against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

This comes days after a Bangladeshi student at Visva-Bharati University, in Santiniketan, West Bengal, was served a ‘Leave India Notice’ by FRRO, Kolkata, for engaging in “anti-government activities”.

Like Meem, Siedcynski has been asked to leave the country within 15 days. He is learnt to have received the notice a few days ago.

“It is really unfortunate to have a brilliant student like Kamil leave his course midway. I deeply regret this loss to the student of Bengali literature, who loved the language and this state,” Sayantan Dasgupta, professor of Comparative Literature at Jadavpur University, said.

Siedcynski’s friends here said he comes from a small town in Poland bordering Germany and came to Visva-Bharati first out of his curiosity for Bengali language. He subsequently joined the Comparative Literature course in Jadavpur University. While studying the language here, he began translating Polish poems and prose into Bangla, many of which have been published by Jadavpur University Press.

This comes soon after the government revoked the visa of Jakob Lindenthal, a German exchange student at IIT-Madras who was asked to leave the country two months ago after he participated in protests against the CAA.

On Wednesday, Meem, a Bangladeshi student at Visva-Bharati, received the Leave India notice from the FRRO. While the notice does not specify the “anti-government activities” Meem is accused of, students and a section of Visva-Bharati teachers had taken out several rallies on the campus against CAA in December last year and January this year, and Meem, 20, allegedly joined the protests and posted images on social media. Some of her friends have said Meem did not participate in the protests and only posted the images on social media.

39,Uddhav Thackeray requires ‘briefing’ to understand how NPR is basis of NRC: Manish Tewari,"Congress’ Manish Tewari (L) said that on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackarey (R) needs to be reacquainted with the design of the Constitution that religion cannot be the basis of citizenship. Congress’ Manish Tewari (L) said that on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackarey (R) needs to be reacquainted with the design of the Constitution that religion cannot be the basis of citizenship.

Congress leader Manish Tewari on Saturday said Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray “requires a briefing” on the Citizenship Amendment Rules-2003 to understand how the NPR is the basis of the NRC.

Tewari also said that on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), Thackarey needs to be reacquainted with the design of the Constitution that religion cannot be the basis of citizenship.

The sharp remarks by the former Union minister on the chief of the Shiv Sena, the Congress’ ally in Maharashtra, came a day after Thackarey met Prime Minister Narendra Modi, following which he said no one needs to fear about the CAA as it is not meant for throwing anyone out of the country.

“CM Maharashtra Uddhav Thackarey requires a briefing on Citizenship Amendment Rules -2003 to understand how NPR (National Population Register) is basis of NRC (National Register of Citizens).

“Once you do NPR you can not stop NRC. On CAA — needs to be reacquainted with design of Indian Constitution that religion can not be basis of Citizenship,” said Tewari, a Congress spokesperson.

The Shiv Sena chief had said an atmosphere is being created in the country that the NRC is “dangerous” for Muslims, but added that the exercise will not be carried out in Maharashtra.

Talking to reporters after his meeting with Modi that lasted nearly an hour, Thackeray had said he had a discussion on the CAA, the NPR and the NRC.

“Talking about NPR and Census…the census happens every 10 years and it is important that it takes place. I have assured all the citizens of my state that no one’s right will be taken away,” he had said.

40,"White House on CAA, NRC: Trump will raise issue of religious freedom with Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. (AP/File) Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump. (AP/File)

Expressing concerns over the rights of minorities, the White House has said that US President Donald Trump will raise the issue of religious freedom with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his two-day visit to India next week.

“President Trump will talk about our shared tradition of democracy and religious freedom both in his public remarks and then certainly in private. He will raise these issues, particularly the religious freedom issue, which is extremely important to this administration,” a senior official told reporters in a conference call on Friday. Read in Malayalam

When asked about the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizenship (NRC), which have sparked widespread protests, the official said, “We are concerned with some of the issues that you have raised.”

“I think the President will talk about these issues in his meetings with Prime Minister Modi and note that the world is looking to India to continue to uphold its democratic traditions, respect for religious minorities,” the official added.

The senior official also referred to a poll victory speech by Prime Minister Narendra Modi where he spoke about the inclusion of minorities.

“Prime Minister Modi, in his first speech after winning the election last year, talked about how he would prioritise being inclusive of India’s religious minorities. And, certainly, the world looks to India to maintain religious liberty and equal treatment for all under the rule of law,” the official said.



Noting that the US has great respect for India’s democratic traditions and institutions, the official said, “We do have this shared commitment to upholding our universal values, the rule of law. We have great respect for India’s democratic traditions and institutions, and we will continue to encourage India to uphold those traditions.”

“Of course, it’s in the Indian constitution — religious freedom, respect for religious minorities, and equal treatment of all religions. So this is something that is important to the president and I’m sure it will come up,” he added.

The official also pointed out that India has a strong democratic foundation and is rich in religious, linguistic, and cultural diversity.

“In fact, it’s the birthplace of four major world religions,” the official noted.

Besides the US President, First Lady Melania Trump and daughter Ivanka will also be travelling to India on February 24 for the two-day visit. The trio will lead a 12-member delegation to Ahmedabad, Agra and New Delhi.

Pacts being readied: Homeland security to facilitation of trade

India and the United States are readying at least five pacts on homeland security, trade facilitation and intellectual property rights ahead of the bilateral meeting.

While the pact on homeland security will tackle counter-terrorism cooperation, the trade facilitation pact will look at providing a single-window system for US firms wanting to do business in India.

The two sides will also issue a joint statement, which will put significant emphasis on counter-terrorism, Indo-Pacific, space and nuclear issues.

Sources said while 8-10 pacts are under “active consideration”, about half-a-dozen are expected to be signed and announced during Trump’s visit.

Pak must crack down on terrorists for successful dialogue with India: White House

Besides this, the White House also said that successful dialogue between India and Pakistan would be possible if the latter cracks down on terrorists and extremists on its territory.

“I think what you’ll hear from the President is very much encouraging a reduction in tensions between India and Pakistan, encouraging the two countries to engage in bilateral dialogue with each other to resolve their differences,” a senior administration official said, when asked whether Trump would offer to mediate on the Kashmir issue again during his upcoming Indian visit.

41,"AIADMK seeks to reach out to Muslims, says it will not allow any measure against minorities in TN","The K Palaniswami government has also written to the Centre that certain information and documents like Aadhaar should be avoided in the upcoming Census, the party said, (File) The K Palaniswami government has also written to the Centre that certain information and documents like Aadhaar should be avoided in the upcoming Census, the party said, (File)

Amid continuing protests by Muslims over CAA, NRC and NPR in Tamil Nadu, the ruling AIADMK on Friday sought reassure the community, saying it will not allow anything that would harm minorities and charged its arch-rival DMK with trying to create confusion through false propaganda.

The K Palaniswami government has also written to the Centre that certain information and documents like Aadhaar should be avoided in the upcoming Census, the party said, in an apparent reference to apprehensions being raised over certain aspects of the National Population Register process.

“No injustice will be meted out to any minority brother and sister in Tamil Nadu. The government will not allow any activity against minorities. AIADMK will be a true friend for the Muslim community forever,” a party statement said appealing for maintaining communal harmony.

The statement by top AIADMK leaders Deputy Chief Minister O Panneerselvam and Chief Minister K Palaniswami comes in the backdrop of latest round of protests here and some other parts of the state against the amended citizenship law, NPR and the national register of citizens.

Among others, a massive protest was held here on Wednesday in which thousands of Muslims, including women, took part and urged the state assembly to adopt an anti-CAA resolution in the session that ended on Thursday.

Besides, Old Washermenpet in north Chennai has been witnessing protest by Muslims and others over the CAA, NPR and NRC since February 14 and been dubbed as “Chennai’s Shaheen Bagh” in the social media.

AIADMK Coordinator Panneerselvam and Joint Coordinator Palaniswami in their joint statement said the NPR was formulated during the Congress-led UPA government in 2010, in which the DMK was a key constituent.

The government was keen on protecting the country’s sovereignty, supporting schemes taken up “as per” court directives and maintaining cordial ties with the Centre and neighbouring states as much as possible for Tamil Nadu’s welfare, they said.

It has written to the Centre that information like mother tongue, parentage, spouse’ birthday and place and documents like Aadhaar and voter ID, besides mobile number “should be avoided” during the 2020 Census, the leaders said.

The AIADMK government treading the path laid down by party stalwarts late M G Ramachandran (MGR) and J Jayalalithaa “will determinedly strive to uphold brotherhood and equality that will benefit the minority community,” they said.

“All, especially the Muslim brothers and sisters should understand that anti-social elements and some political parties which will carry out any heinous activity to come to power are trying to scuttle law and order.”

Training their guns against their arch-rival, they said “it is condemnable that unable to stomach AIADMK government’s growing public support, DMK is trying to instigate and spread a false propaganda to create confusion among Muslims.”

The DMK is steadfastly opposed to CAA, NPR and NRC and has been staging protests, especially against the amended citizenship act.

The party has been targeting the AIADMK, saying but for its support the citizenship amendment bill would not have been passed in the Rajya Sabha.

Panneerselvam and Palaniswami maintained that the AIADMK was a “true secular” movement which did not discriminate in the name of religion and treated all as brothers, on the lines of MGR, the party founder, and Jayalalithaa.

Ever since the days of Ramachandran, the party has stood by the Muslims as their “protector and friend”, the two leaders said and listed out the various welfare measures being implemented for the community.

On NRC in Assam, they said it was carried out in accordance with the Supreme Court directions “but is not meant for the entire country.”

“The Centre has already clarified it is not against minorities, especially Muslims,” they said, adding, the Centre has not expanded it to other states beyond Assam.

Calling for brotherhood, the two leaders said “false propaganda and mischief” against the government should be ignored and that all should strive for communal harmony.

“The minorities should be alert and be careful to those trying to conspire mischievous campaigns for their own selfish interests and maintain calm,” they appealed.

Palaniswami had in the state assembly on Tuesday accused the DMK of deceiving the people over the CAA and dared it to explain “which minority” community has been affected by the law in the state.

42,"No one needs to fear about CAA, NPR: Thackeray after meeting PM Modi","Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. (Twitter/OfficeofUT) Prime Minister Narendra Modi with Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray. (Twitter/OfficeofUT)

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray, who met Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday in the national capital, said that no one needs to fear the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and asserted that the National Population Register (NPR) is not going to throw anyone out.

“I had a good discussion with the Prime Minister over issues concerning Maharashtra. I also discussed the CAA, NPR and NRC with the Prime Minister. No one needs to fear about the CAA. The NPR is not going to throw anyone out of the country,” the Shiv Sena chief said after his meeting concluded.

Thackeray’s comments came in the backdrop of nationwide protests, largely led by women, against CAA and the proposed nationwide NRC. The meeting with the PM also came after the Shiv Sena supremo supported NPR, suggesting that he had no problems in rolling out the exercise in Maharashtra.

Thackeray’s stand is in variance with that of his allies, the Congress and the NCP, which have been vehement in their opposition to the CAA and the NRC as well as the NPR.

Thackeray also denied that there was any friction among the constituents of the “Maha Aghadi” while asserting that his government will complete its five-year term.

The BJP and the Shiv Sena, who contested the assembly elections together, had a bitter fallout after the results last year over the Chief Minister’s post. The Sena later aligned with the arch-rivals Congress and the NCP to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government.

Thackeray also met Congress president Sonia Gandhi, veteran BJP leader L K Advani and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

Earlier in December, PM Modi had distanced his government from a pan-India NRC and had said that Muslims, who are “sons of the soil” have nothing to fear from either CAA or NRC. He had also denied any existence of detention centres in the country, saying these were lies being spread by the “Congress, its allies, some educated Naxals and urban Naxals”.

43,CAA+NRC can lead to ‘disenfranchisement’ of Indian Muslims: US body,"Widespread protests have been witnessed in India against the CAA. Widespread protests have been witnessed in India against the CAA.

Just days before United States President Donald Trump’s scheduled visit to India, a US body Thursday issued a factsheet on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), saying that the law in conjunction with the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC) is part of an effort to “create a religious test” and could lead to the widespread “disenfranchisement of Indian Muslims”.

The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), a body mandated by US statute to “monitor the universal right to freedom of religion or belief abroad”, also said that the CAA represents a significant downward turn in religious freedom in India.

“There are serious concerns that the CAA serves as a protective measure for non-Muslims in case of exclusion from a nationwide NRC—a proposed list of all Indian citizens. This purpose is evident from BJP politicians’ rhetoric. With the CAA in place, Muslims would primarily bear the punitive consequences of exclusion from the NRC which could include statelessness, deportation, or prolonged detention,” the body said, citing three UN Special Rapporteurs.

“The CAA and NRC must also be understood in the context of the growing prominence of the BJP’s Hindutva ideology. This ideological frame views India as a Hindu state (with its definition of Hinduism inclusive of Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs) and Islam as a foreign and invading religion,” the USCIRF said.

The body, which was created by The International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA), also said that the Hindutva rhetoric in India questions the legitimacy of citizenships of Muslims and perpetuates the further marginalization of this faith community.

Earlier, the body had also urged the US government to consider imposing sanctions on Union Home Minister Amit Shah if the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) was passed by Parliament.

In a statement, the USCIRF had then said that it was “deeply troubled” by the CAB’s passage in Lok Sabha, “given the religion criterion in the Bill”, and recommended that “If the CAB passes in both Houses of Parliament, the US government should consider sanctions against the Home Minister and other principal leadership”.

Widespread protests have erupted across India against the CAA that grants citizenship to individuals who are Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, or Parsi and who entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan by the cut-off date of December 31, 2014 — excluding Muslims.

Thousands of protesters Wednesday hit the streets in Chennai against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), a day after the Madras High Court denied permission to a body of Muslim outfits to lay seige to the state Assembly.

Agitators carrying placards against the CAA, NRC and NPR, began their march to the Secretariat, which houses the Assembly. They are demanding the Assembly to pass a resolution against the new citizenship law.

The protesters were forced to stop the march at Chepauk, a few kilometres ahead of the Secretariat, as several roads leading to the building were blocked and security was heightened. The police also used drone-mounted cameras to control the crowd.

Chennai has been witnessing protests against the CAA, NRC and NPR for the past five days, which intensified following police action on protesters at Old Washermenpet.

Chennai has been witnessing protests against the CAA, NRC and NPR for the past five days, which intensified after the police action on protesters at Old Washermenpet in the city. Defending the police action, Chief Minister K Palanaswami said that the government had received information that some few toxic elements are instigating the protests. “The protest in Washermanpet took place without permission. Hundreds of women and men took to the streets and blocked the roads causing disruption to public peace,” he said.

Earlier this week, DMK chief M K Stalin said a resolution should be passed in the Assembly, and sought government action against police personnel who resorted to lathicharge. He also asked for cases against the protesters to be withdrawn. However, Assembly Speaker P Dhanapal said the state assembly does not have the provision to pass a resolution against CAA.

Anti-CAA protests were held elsewhere in the state, including Madurai and Tirunelveli, among other places.

Along with the chargesheet filed in connection with the violence in New Friends Colony and at Jamia Millia Islamia, the police attached CCTV, call detail records and statements of over 100 witnesses as evidence against Sharjeel, reported news agency PTI.

The violence had broken out in parts of Delhi during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The police is probing two cases; the first relates to clashes between a section of protesters and police, when vehicles, including a bus, were set ablaze. The second case is regarding the police crackdown at Jamia.

Imam was arrested in Bihar on January 28 on sedition charges. On Monday, a Delhi court sent him to one-day police custody in the case related to the violence at New Friends Colony. On Tuesday, his custody was extended till March 3, reported PTI.

The Indian Express earlier reported on February 11 that a special investigation team of the Delhi Police’s Crime Branch was likely to book Imam in connection with the cases, but was seeking legal opinion before invoking charges of criminal conspiracy.

Imam has already been booked by the inter-state cell of the Crime Branch under IPC sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, etc) and 505 (statements conducing to public mischief) over a speech he delivered at AMU. Besides Delhi, police in Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Assam and Arunachal Pradesh have booked him for alleged sedition.

During investigations, the SIT found that Imam was a volunteer at the Shaheen Bagh protest until January 2.

(PTI) Varanasi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the closing ceremony of the Centenary Celebrations of Shri Jagadguru Vishwaradhya Gurukul at Jangamwadi Math in Varanasi, Sunday, Feb. 16, 2020. (PTI)

Amidst the ongoing nationwide protest against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday reiterated that his government stands by the decision “despite all pressure”.

“For years, India had been waiting for decisions like repealing Article 370 and the introduction of CAA. These decisions were necessary in the interest of the country. Despite all the pressure, we stood our ground over these decisions and will remain so,” Modi said while addressing a public meeting in Varanasi.

Modi, who is on a day-long visit to his Lok Sabha constituency, laid the foundation of 50 projects worth Rs 1,254 crore, news agency PTI reported. He also flagged off the IRCTC’s ‘Maha Kaal Express’ through video link.

The prime minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre and unveiled a 63-feet tall statue of the RSS ideologue – the tallest statue of the leader in the country.

The prime minister also dedicated to the nation the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Memorial Centre and unveiled a 63-feet tall statue of the RSS ideologue – the tallest statue of the leader in the country.

Earlier this month, PM Modi, while replying to the Motion of Thanks to the President’s address in the Lok Sabha, had called the CAA protests “a road to anarchy” and that “protest marches, violence, and arson” against a law duly passed and notified by Parliament will “create a problem for the country”.

He had also targeted the Opposition saying they are building narratives keeping only the vote bank in mind.

Widespread protests, largely led by women, against the amended law which grants citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh have cropped up in the last two months. The law has become controversial largely because it excludes Muslims.

Several opposition ruled states across have also raised their concern against the CAA and said they will not implement the new citizenship law.

47,Watch: New video shows Delhi Police assaulting students inside Jamia library,"Screengrab of the video showing the police assaulting the students inside Jamia library. (Source: Twitter @Jamia_JCC) Screengrab of the video showing the police assaulting the students inside Jamia library. (Source: Twitter @Jamia_JCC)

Two months after the alleged police brutality inside Jamia campus, another CCTV footage has emerged showing policemen beating up students.

On December 15, a protest against the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) turned violent after protesters allegedly pelted stones at the police and set public buses on fire. Later, there were allegations that the police entered the college library and beat up the students, who weren’t protesting.

On Saturday, another such video was released by the Jamia students. The 44-second video showed policemen wearing anti-riot gear, entering the library. There were around 10-20 students inside as cops thrashed the students with batons and pushed them outside the hall.

While sharing the video clipping on Twitter, the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC) claimed that the incident took place on the first floor of MA, MPhil section inside Old Reading Hall on December 15. The tweet also said, “Shame on you Delhi Police.”

Although Jamia authorities confirmed that the video was from inside the library, they said it was not released by the university.

“It has come to our notice that some video with regard to police brutality in Dr Zakir Husain Library of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) is in circulation. This is to clarify that the video has not been released by the university,” Ahmad Azeem, the PRO of JMI, said.

“This is to clarify that JCC is not an official body of the university. Any communication from JCC should not be taken as communication from the university,” the PRO said, adding that the university’s official Twitter handle is @jmiu_official.

RP Meena, DCP (south-east) said, “The case is being probed by the crime branch. We will check whether the video is with them and also the authentication of the video. We can comment once the video is checked.”

Special Commissioner (Crime) Praveer Ranjan assured that the police will investigate the latest video. “We have taken cognizance of the latest video (of December 15) of Jamia Millia Islamia University which has surfaced now, we will investigate it,” Ranjan told reporters.

Reacting to the video, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra launched an attack on the current dispensation and the Delhi Police saying they had lied about the incident when they denied any attack on students in the Jamia library on December 15. Sharing the video on Twitter, Priyanka said, “See how the Delhi Police is indiscriminately beating students studying. A boy is showing the book but the policeman is running sticks. The Home Minister and Delhi Police officials lied that they had not beaten anyone by entering the library.”

“After watching this video, if action is not taken on the violence in Jamia, the intention of the government will completely be exposed to the country,” she added.

48,"Azad Maidan, again: Hum Dekhenge","At a protest against the new citizenship law in Mumbai on Saturday. (Photo: Prashant Nadkar) At a protest against the new citizenship law in Mumbai on Saturday. (Photo: Prashant Nadkar)

Thousands of people gathered at Azad Maidan on Saturday afternoon to participate in a ‘Maha Morcha’ organised to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the National Population Register (NPR).

This was the second mass gathering witnessed by Mumbai after the August Kranti Maidan protest last December. While organisers of Saturday’s rally — ‘Alliance against CAA, NRC & NPR Mumbai’ — claimed that two lakh people were in attendance, the police pegged the figure at 70,000.

Speakers from diverse backgrounds, including politicians, Muslim scholars, social activists and even the former principal of St Xavier’s College, Fr. Frazer Mascarenhas, addressed the crowd.

“We have to stand united and fight this law. Even our Cardinal Oswald Gracias has said that a law that does not benefit the people should be taken back,” Fr. Mascarenhas said. Condemning the attacks on JNU and Jamia Millia Islamia students, he added: “I cannot imagine a situation when the police would not help if students are attacked. When terrorists attacked Mumbai, within minutes, police personnel from Azad Maidan had arrived to protect our students, but this was not the case when goons attacked students in JNU. At Jamia Millia, police entered and attacked students. This cannot be our Bharat.”

Others who attended the event included the convener of the protest, Justice (retd) Kolse Patil, social activist Teesta Setalvad, actor Sushant Singh and Samajwadi Party leader Abu Asim Azmi.

Justice (retd) Patil urged the crowd not to show any document to government officials amid reports that the state is set to roll out NPR from April 1. “Some of our brothers are trying to gather papers to prove their citizenship from April 1, when these clerks and constables will come knocking on your doors. Do not show them documents.”

Shushant Singh, taking on the Centre for its remark that “buses should not be burnt” during protests, said: “We will make a promise to not burn buses, as they are few in number… but men can be killed and burnt as their population is certainly much more than buses.”

The protesters came to Azad Maidan from various parts of Mumbai and extended suburbs like Navi Mumbai, Thane as well as other parts of Maharashtra. With hundreds of buses ferrying them to Azad Maidan, men and women of all ages began to assemble for the protest from 2 pm. By 4 pm, many could be seen waiting outside the ground due to lack of space.

Waving the Tricolour and holding banners denouncing the CAA-NRC-NPR in their hands, the protesters raised slogans like “Modi, Shah se Azadi” “freedom from the CAA and the NRC” while reciting Urdu poet Faiz Ahmad Faiz’s popular poem Hum Dekhenge.

Akhtari Ansari (58) listened to the speeches with rapt attention. A Jogeshwari resident, she travelled for around two-and-a-half hours to be a part of the protest. “I cannot sit for long… my legs get swollen. But it is important to be here.”

Qutubuddin Ansari (73), who runs a bakery in Charkop, arrived at the protest with 18 other members of his family. “At least 34 buses came to our area. At my age, health is always a problem. But the pain I suffered while coming here is nothing when compared to what we would face if we do not show our opposition now,” he added.

Among the crowd stood 24-year-old Wasim Shaikh, holding a poster that read ‘Pyaar Baato Desh Nahi’. Wasim, who works at a call centre, said: “The government has the power to make laws but we have the power to oppose them.”

The crowd cheered as speakers raised the slogan ‘Shaheen Bagh Zindabad’. Mumbra resident Afroz Khan (40), who wore a head band that read ‘No to CAA and NRC’, said: “It is refreshing to see that the protest had moved beyond being of Muslims alone… those from other religions and walks of life are also here.”

49,Can’t label anti-CAA protesters traitors… need to protect rights: Bombay High Court,"Anti-CAA protests in Mumbai: The Aurangabad Bench said those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “cannot be called traitors”. Anti-CAA protests in Mumbai: The Aurangabad Bench said those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “cannot be called traitors”.

Setting aside an order by the Additional District Magistrate against allowing protests in Maharashtra’s Beed, the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court said that those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act “cannot be called traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law”.

The Court said that an agitation cannot be suppressed only on the ground that people are agitating against the government. It also asked the bureaucracy to “keep in mind” that when people believe that a “particular Act is an attack on their rights… they are bound to defend that right”. And underlined that it is not for the Court “to ascertain whether the exercise of such right will create a law and order problem”.

Granting relief to petitioners who were seeking permission to sit at a location for an indefinite agitation, the Court noted they had given an undertaking that no slogans would be raised against the country, any religion, or unity and integrity of the nation.

“The submissions made show that there will be no question of disobedience of provisions of CAA by such agitation. This Court is expected to consider the right of such persons to start agitation in a peaceful way. This Court wants to express that such persons cannot be called as traitors, anti-nationals only because they want to oppose one law. It will be an act of protest and only against the government for the reason of CAA,” the Division Bench of Justices T V Nalawade and M G Sewlikar said Thursday.

The Court was hearing a petition filed by a 45-year-old Beed resident, Iftekhar Shaikh, challenging an order by a police inspector last month refusing permission for an agitation based on an order by the additional district magistrate.

The Court said the order by the magistrate refers to a letter by the District SP on agitations by political parties for many causes, including against the CAA. The SP had written that such agitations could lead to a law and order problem. The order said that the agitations include those by farmers due to damaged crops, others due to increase in price of commodities, and against the CAA.

The Court said one of the clauses of the order prevented “sloganeering, singing, beating drums”. “It can be said that though the order on face appears to be against everybody, in reality the order is against persons who want to agitate, to protest against the CAA. At present, such agitations are going on everywhere and there was no whisper of agitations of other nature in this region. Thus, it can be said that there was no fairness and the order was not made honestly,” the Court said.

It said the Constitutional validity of the CAA was being heard in the Supreme Court and hence it would not comment on it.

“When we are considering a proceeding like the present one, we must keep in mind that we are a democratic republic country and our Constitution has given us rule of law and not rule of majority. When such an Act is made, some people, maybe of a particular religion like Muslims, may feel that it is against their interest and such Act needs to be opposed. It is a matter of their perception and belief and the Court cannot go into the merits of that perception or belief,” the Court said.

It said courts had to examine whether these persons have the right to agitate and oppose a law. “If the Court finds that it is part of their fundamental right, it is not open to the Court to ascertain whether the exercise of such right will create law and order problem. That is the problem of a political government. In such cases, it is the duty of the Government to approach such persons, have talks with them and try to convince them,” the Court said.

It said the authorities cannot be of the perception that only one particular community or religion had an interest in opposing the law, stating that their own order said members from all communities were agitating. “…many persons of all the communities may feel that it is against the interest of mankind, humanity or basic human values. We need to remember the Constitutional and legal history when we consider the provisions of the Constitution,” it said.

Referring to the freedom struggle and the agitation against the British led by Mahatma Gandhi, including the Khilafat Movement, the Court said the movement was in solidarity with and support to the cause of Muslims of another country, even though no Indian Muslims were affected in seeking to preserve the authority of the Ottoman Sultan.

“India got freedom due to agitations which were non-violent and this path of non-violence is followed by the people of this country till this date. We are fortunate that most of the people of this country still believe in non-violence. In the present matter also, the petitioners and companions want to agitate peacefully to show their protest,” the Court said.

It said that the bureaucracy needs to be “sensitive” in matters of dissent by giving proper training on human rights. “The bureaucracy needs to keep in mind that when citizens who believe that a particular Act is an attack on their rights which were achieved by the freedom struggle, and when it is against the provisions of the Constitution which people have given to themselves, they are bound to defend that right. If they are not allowed to do so, the possibility of use of force is always there and the result will be violence, chaos, disorder and ultimately the danger to the unity of this country,” the Court said.

It said that people from all religions supporting the minority community shows that “we have achieved fraternity to a great extent”. It said that the grounds put forward by district authorities that the agitation could lead to a possible problem of law and order cannot be considered by the court, “particularly for reason that it involves the exercise of fundamental right”.

The authorities submitted in court that permission will be given to those who want to agitate peacefully.

50,The fight is to take back Constitution and country: Anurag Kashyap to Jamia students,"Anurag Kashyap also went to Shaheen Bagh. (Twitter) Anurag Kashyap also went to Shaheen Bagh. (Twitter)

A visit to Jamia Millia Islamia where students and others have been sitting in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act has convinced him he is “alive”, an impassioned Anurag Kashyap said on Friday.

The filmmaker, at the forefront of the criticism against the amended citizenship act, assured the students that he and many others stood behind the students in their long fight.

“I have come here for the first time. If we talk about the time before the past three months, I used to believe that we are finished and dead… but coming here today I’m convinced we are alive,” Kashyap told the gathering.

The fight, he said, was to “take the constitution, country and everything” back.

“This is a very long fight. It won’t end tomorrow, the day after or with the next election. But you need to have a lot of patience for this. They are waiting for people here to get tired and go home. So we need to have patience and stick to your ground,” he said.

The outspoken director of films such as “Gangs of Wasseypur” and “Dev D”, who also went to Shaheen Bagh, the epicentre of the anti-CAA protest, said people in power are waiting for the protesters’ spirit to weaken.

“We have to be patient and sit in protest till you don’t come and answer all the questions that we have in our hearts to our satisfaction. We will not believe everything you say,” he said.

The students of Jamia are also protesting against what they term repeated instances of alleged police brutality. On February 10, they alleged, police personnel kicked them on their private parts, tore their hijabs, questioned their patriotism and abused them when they tried to march to Parliament on February 10 against the CAA and the NRC.

Kashyap said he had left Twitter but returned to it in December after police allegedly attacked students and entered the Jamia campus.

“I had left everything and went away but I changed my mind after what happened in Jamia in December. I saw a video of a girl and that gave me courage to return to Twitter. Now I will not stay silent,” he said.

What started in Jamia has spread to different parts of the country, the director said.

“Everyday I read stories and watch videos about you people. This gives me strength. What is happening gives us the understanding and strength that we have an existence,” he added.

Kashyap, who has been speaking out on Twitter and other platforms, joins personalities from the film industry such as Swara Bhasker and Mohammed Zeeshan Ayub who have not just voiced their opinions on social media but also been on the ground in Delhi and Mumbai to speak to the protesters.

51,Puducherry becomes first UT to pass resolution against Citizenship Act,"Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy speaks during the special Assembly session on Wednesday. (Source: Twitter/@VNarayanasami) · Puducherry CM V Narayanasamy speaks during the special Assembly session on Wednesday. (Source: Twitter/@VNarayanasami) ·

The Puducherry Legislative Assembly Wednesday passed a resolution against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and urged the Centre to withdraw the legislation, which has set off nationwide protests and led to over 25 deaths.

The resolution, which was passed during a special one-day Assembly session, saw MLAs from All India NR Congress (AINRC) and AIADMK boycotting the proceedings of the House.

Puducherry is the first Union Territory to pass a resolution against the CAA. Five state governments – Kerala, Punjab, Rajasthan, West Bengal, and Madhya Pradesh – have also passed resolutions against the contentious Act. All the states, along with Puducherry, are ruled by non-BJP governments.

Last week, the Madhya Pradesh Cabinet passed the resolution, urging the Centre to roll-back the CAA and withdraw new columns in the NPR and to update the population register only after that.

The Telangana government has also announced that it would not implement the CAA that has seen widespread protests across the country.

Delhi, and Shaheen Bagh in specific, has been the nucleus of anti-CAA protests ever since the citizenship law was amended allowing easier citizenship for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians, Parsis and Jains who came to India after facing religious persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh before 2015.

Those opposing the CAA contend that it discriminates on the basis of religion and violates the Constitution. They also allege that the CAA, along with the proposed NRC, is intended to target the Muslim community in the country.

Several leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, and Amarinder Singh have protested against the CAA-NRC-NPR, calling it ‘unconstitutional’ and against the secular fabric of the democracy.

“Bengal has the guts to skip NPR meeting in Delhi. If the BJP wants it can dismiss my government. Time has come to put aside narrow differences and fight together to save the country,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had said during the passage of the anti-CAA resolution in West Bengal Assembly.

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought the Centre’s response to a plea seeking a court-monitored probe by a committee or an SIT into the police crackdown at Jamia Millia Islamia University on December 15 last year.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar issued notice to the Centre, Delhi government and police seeking their stand on the petition filed by a Jamia student who lost vision in his one eye in the violence and is battling to save sight in the other.

The petitioner, Md Minhajuddin, has also sought compensation commensurate with his qualifications for the injury suffered by him and also the registration of an FIR against police personnel involved in the incident.

The petition has also sought directions to the authorities to bear expenses of his treatment and to provide him a permanent job commensurate with his qualifications.

On December 15 last year, a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act near Jamia turned violent, with demonstrators pelting stones at police and setting public buses and private vehicles on fire.

Police later entered Jamia, firing tear gas shells and baton-charging students. Several students, including the petitioner, were injured in the police crackdown.

53,"Supreme Court on Shaheen Bagh: Protests cannot block road, cause inconvenience","The Supreme Court said on Monday that protests must be held in “identified areas” and protesters cannot block public roads. (File) The Supreme Court said on Monday that protests must be held in “identified areas” and protesters cannot block public roads. (File)

HEARING PETITIONS against the anti-CAA protests at Shaheen Bagh, the Supreme Court said on Monday that protests must be held in “identified areas” and protesters cannot block public roads and cause inconvenience to others.

“You cannot block public roads. There cannot be indefinite period of protest in such an area. If you want to protest, it has to be in an area identified for protest,” said a bench comprising Justices S K Kaul and K M Joseph. “You cannot create inconvenience for the people,” it said.

“There’s a law enacted, and challenge to it is pending in the Court. It’s fine that some people may want to protest. The protests have gone on for many days… There must be an area where you can protest. It cannot be held wherever one wants. It has to be in identified area… Otherwise people will go and protest anywhere,” said Justice Kaul, adding that protests cannot be held at the cost of the citizens’ interests.

The court was hearing petitions filed by Advocate Amit Sahni and Delhi BJP leader Nand Kishore Garg on the traffic disruption due to the protests.

“There cannot be an indefinite protest in such an area… There must be an area where you can protest,” said Justice Kaul.

As Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for Bhim Army chief Chandrasekhar Azad, sought to intervene, Justice Joseph asked, “Can you block a public road?”

“You can’t do that even in a park,” said Justice Kaul.

The bench, however, said it would like to hear the state before passing any order. Issuing notices to the Centre, Delhi government and Delhi Police, it posted the matter for further hearing on February 17.

Advocate Shashank Deo Sudhi, appearing for Garg, urged the court to pass an interim direction, saying people have been facing difficulties for several days now. The bench, however, declined the request. “If you have waited for over 50 days, you can wait for some more days,” it said.

In his appeal. Sahni sought to know “whether the protesters have unrestricted rights under Article 19 of the Constitution of India to protest on a busy road in violation of other person’s right to have a thoroughfare and whether such protests can be permitted to continue especially when a particular road is blocked for over a month”.

He said that while “there is no quarrel with the proposition that everyone has a right to protest, the same is subject to reasonable restrictions, which can be imposed looking into the larger public interest”.

“The public at large is facing huge inconvenience/ hardship as the said road is blocked since 15-12-2019 and the residents, shopkeepers, children and patients are facing extreme difficulties,” he said.

Sahni had earlier approached the Delhi High Court, seeking directions to the Delhi Police to ensure smooth traffic flow on the Kalindi Kunj-Shaheen Bagh stretch. The HC had asked the police to look into the matter.

Garg, in his petition, said the law enforcement machinery was being “held hostage to the whims and fancies of the protesters”, and sought the court’s intervention to formulate guidelines for protests in public places.

54,"Had four-month-old child gone to Shaheen Bagh to protest, asks SC on infant’s death","The child’s mother, Nazia. (ANI) The child’s mother, Nazia. (ANI)

Taking suo motu cognizance of the death of a four-month-old infant, allegedly because of exposure to the cold at the Shaheen Bagh protest, the Supreme Court — responding to the counsel who contended that children too have a right to protest — asked if the infant had gone for the protest.

“A four-month-old child had gone there to protest? Did the four-month-old child go there to protest?”Chief Justice of India S A Bobde exclaimed as advocate Nandita Rao, appearing for rights activist John Dayal, said that the United Nations Charter on the Rights of the Child, which has been ratified by India, guarantees a child’s right to protest.

The bench, also comprising Justice B R Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, cut short advocate Shahrukh Alam, who was representing some mothers from Shaheen Bagh and had sought to submit that their children were being called Pakistani and gaddar in school.

“Don’t bring in issues. We will not hear… We don’t want people to use this platform to further create a problem. Whether in school somebody called a child Pakistani is not the subject matter of this,” remarked the CJI.

As the counsel kept up their objections, the CJI added: “We are not considering CAA, NRC or rude behaviour in school. We are not considering use of words like Pakistani… so don’t make such submissions… We have the highest respect for motherhood. We have the highest respect for social peace. We want those children to be at peace…”

“We are not stifling any voice. We know what we are doing. This is a properly constituted proceeding, so don’t make irrelevant arguments,” the CJI added.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, termed the death of the infant “really unfortunate”.

Intervening, Rao cited the case of youth activist Greta Thunberg leading the fight against climate change, and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had applauded her and exhorted children to take the lead on issues of global warming. The court, however, said this was not relevant to the proceedings.

Rao said the child had not died in Shaheen Bagh, but in the shanty behind Jamia where the family lived, and added that the condition of children living in poverty should be looked into. She said children are taken to fairs and jagratas too, where too they are susceptible to cold, and that no one can be blamed for this.

The bench said it will look into their prayer for impleadment.

The court also said it will look into the request of 12-year-old National Bravery Award winner Zen Gunratan Sadavarte, seeking permission to submit arguments in the matter.

Following the death of the infant, Sadavarte had written to the CJI’s office, urging the court to intervene to protect the rights of children, saying that making them attend protest demonstrations “amounts to cruelty”.

Sadavarte, recipient of the 2019 Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) National Bravery Award, said in her letter that the infant’s parents and organisers of protests at Shaheen Bagh had “failed” to protect the rights of the child, resulting in his death.

Subsequently, the SC registered suo motu proceedings under the title: ‘In Re to stop involvement of children and infants in demonstrations and agitations in view of death of an infant on 30.01.2020 at Shaheen Bagh, New Delhi.’

At least 16 people were injured in a clash between anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protesters and the Delhi Police in Jamia Nagar on Monday, after the protest march was stopped from moving towards Parliament.

While most of those injured complained they were kicked in their stomach, one woman complained of injury to her private parts, said Dr Abdul Nazar, director of Al-Shifa Hospital. He said initial investigations showed no signs of external injury on the woman, and an ultrasound test was being conducted to check for internal injuries. Jamia Vice-Chancellor Najma Akhtar along with other varsity officials visited the hospital to see the injured students.

Ten days after a man opened fire on a group of protesters in Jamia Nagar, injuring one, hundreds of Jamia Millia Islamia University students, along with residents of nearby Jamia Nagar, took to the streets to register their protests against the CAA, National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

Trouble erupted when the police denied permission for the march — “sansad ghero” protest — and put up barricades to stop the protesters from advancing towards Parliament. Despite repeated appeals from the police to end their agitation, the demonstrators clambered over the barricades, leading to a scuffle between the two sides.

Later, Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh organised a candle march condemning the alleged police brutality on Jamia students.

Meanwhile, another group of protesters, including students and civil society members, marched from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar. A large number of police and paramilitary personnel walked along with them to take care of law and order. “The protesters do not have permission to take out a march, but as long as they maintain peace, we do not have a problem,” a police officer told PTI. The protesters, however, claimed they had permission.

Carrying photographs of freedom fighters Bhagat Singh and Chandrasekhar Azad and social reformer Savitribai Phule, the protesters, from children as young as 10 to senior citizens, demanded that the government revoke the “black law”. The wife of Dr Kafeel Khan, who was acquitted of all negligence and corruption charges in the Gorakhpur BRD Hospital tragedy in September, and brother of Sharjeel Imam, arrested on sedition charges, also took part in the march held under the banner of Welfare Party of India.

On January 30, as over 20 police personnel, including an SHO, watched, a youth fired at a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act near Jamia Millia Islamia University, leaving one student injured.

Later said to be 17 and a juvenile, the teenager brandished a gun at the protest site around 1.45 pm, and shouted slogans of “Yeh lo azadi (Here, take azadi)”, “Desh mein jo rehna hoga, Vande Mataram kehna hoga (If you want to stay in the country, you have to say Vande Mataram)” and “Dilli Police zindabad”, before he fired. As he was being taken away by police, he identified himself as “Ram bhakt”.

56,"Protest, dissent, civil disobedience in India’s DNA, given by Mahatma Gandhi: Chidambaram","Senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram and Prithviraj Chavan in Pune, Friday.

FORMER Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday accused BJP leaders of misleading the country by claiming that those who are opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) were opposing the persecuted Hindus and Sikhs of Pakistan and Bangladesh coming to India. He said the objection of protesters and the Congress is not against those who have been included but is in support of those who have been excluded.

Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for saying that protests were spreading anarchy in the country, Chidambaram said “protest, dissent and civil disobedience is in the DNA of India” and “given to it by Mahatma Gandhi”.

Chidambaram was in Pune to deliver a lecture on ‘CAA-NPR-NRC and the Union Budget’ organised by the Joint Action Committee Against CAA-NRC (Pune) at Tilak Smarak Mandir.

“Yesterday, Prime Minister Modi said street protests were leading to anarchy in the country. He should have been around when Mahatma Gandhi was alive and he should have given this advise to Gandhi. To protest, to dissent and to do civil disobedience is in India’s DNA and that was given to the country by Mahatma Gandhi. People are protesting an unjust law. It’s true that CAA has been passed by the Parliament but even Rowlatt Act was an act of the law. It was opposed because it was unjust. We will oppose the unjust CAA until it is repealed or is struck down by the Supreme Court,” said Chidambaram.

Speaking on the Union Budget 2020-21 presented last week, the former Union Finance minister said it was like a “movie that bombs on the first day”. “It disappeared from the headline in two days,” said Chidambaram.

He said the Budget failed to acknowledge and address the “dire situation” that the Indian economy is in at present.

“Our economy is demand constrained and investment starved. For the demand to pick up, the easiest way would have been to put money in the hands of poor people. It’s wellknown that as they have low propensity to save, they spend most of the additional money that comes to them. This could have been achieved by putting more money in MGNREGA scheme, increasing the scholarships to the OBC, SC/ST students or increasing the amount and coverage of the PM Kisan Scheme started by the government last year. None of this was done,” said Chidambaram.

He said the investment starvation was due to low demand as well as due to the unrest in the country as “no investor would want to put in money in such a situation”.

“There are morchas, protests, police actions and lynchings. The investor is not confident that his money will be safe,” said Chidambaram.

Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan also spoke at the event. “CAA strikes at the fundamental principles of the Constitution and tries to kill its soul. If the government wanted, it could have helped the persecuted minorities from Pakistan and Bangladesh without bringing in a law in this fashion. We need to oppose the CAA, else it will become a precedent for similar laws on the basic of religion to be passed in the country,” said Chavan.
