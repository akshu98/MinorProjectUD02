India's current unemployment rate stands at 7.5 per cent as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). However, the unemployment rate for graduates stands at 18.5 per cent - more than twice the headline rate, according to data for the end of 2019 compiled by CMIE.

The latest findings from the survey conducted by Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy for the period between September and December 2019 has been done after interacting with 1.74 lakh households.

The report depicts a substantial increase in unemployment rate in urban India, which stands at 9 percent compared to unemployment rate in rural India at 6.8 per cent.

The overall unemployment rate for females is at 17.5 per cent versus 6.2 per cent for males. In a more drastic increase, the unemployment rate is as high as 26 per cent for urban females.

Mahesh Vyas, CEO, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV, ""India's headline unemployment rate is at 7.5 per cent but, this understates the real problem on hand which is of lack of sufficient jobs for young graduates.""

""Nearly one in every four graduates in the mid- to late-twenties who is looking for a job is unable to find a job.""

1,Unemployment Rate Among Indian Women More Than Double Of Men: Study,"A study found that unemployment rate among Indian women more than double of men

The unemployment rate among women in India is more than double of that of men with similar qualifications, a new study has revealed. Titled ""Gender Inclusion in Hiring in India"", the study by two Harvard students, Rachel Levenson and Layla O'Kane, noted that 8.7 per cent of working-age urban, educated women in the country are unemployed but only 4 per cent of comparable men find themselves without a job.

""While there are many factors that influence a woman's decision and ability to find work, the gender gap in the unemployment rate along with ILO (International Labour Organisation) research suggest that women, particularly highly-educated ones, face additional barriers as compared to men in accessing jobs,"" it said.

Levenson and O'Kane's analysis is based on close to 200 India-based jobs for which Shortlist, a hiring firm in India, had provided the recruiting platform between 2016 and 2017. It included 286,991 applications from 211,004 applicants (some people applied to multiple jobs).

According to the study, while discrimination based on gender is illegal under the Indian constitution, conversations with hiring managers and other labour market experts have revealed that there is gender discrimination in the hiring process across the country, as is the case around the world.

The study looks at three stages at which women may face barriers during hiring -- qualifications and experience, recruitment and choice to apply, and application process, while suggesting tools to increase gender diversity in the Indian workforce.

It highlighted the need for gender inclusive work places by correlating it with ""higher levels of performance and innovation"".

""Inclusive hiring improves firm-level growth by allowing companies to attract and retain top talent and better serving consumers in markets or sectors where women are a key customer segment,"" it said.

The study also noted that increasing female participation in the labour force could increase the Indian GDP by 27 per cent.

Not dismissing the progress, albeit little, that several multinational corporations in the country have made towards minimising gender discrimination at work place over the past couple of decades, it highlighted the role technology could play in improving hiring outcomes including increasing the number of women who apply and get shortlisted for jobs.

""We know that diverse teams perform better, and we're encouraged by these results because they show that even small and medium sized businesses, and not just large enterprises, can leverage technology to increase the diversity of their candidate pools,"" said Simon Desjardins, Co-founder of Shortlist.

The study suggested competency-based assessments, behavioral nudges in recruitment, and well-designed job descriptions, for creating a more effective bias-reducing, gender-sensitive hiring process in India.

2,"Provident Fund Enrolment, Tax Data Can't Measure Jobs: Think Tank Chief","Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct, says Mahesh Vyas (File)

Amid the controversy over the withholding of a report on the country's unemployment situation, the government has cited data from provident fund records, Income Tax filings and the National Pension System (NPS), besides a possible upswing in the informal sector to show generation of crores of new jobs.

However, this does not mean there is an increase in jobs, the chief of the think tank that claimed last month 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 in an alarming report, has said.

During his reply on the motion of thanks on the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said new jobs were created in the unorganised sector, which accounts for 80-85 per cent employment, citing an increase in the sale of commercial vehicles, infrastructure building and housing activities.

He said about 1.8 crore people had enrolled in the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) in the past 15 months, and 64 per cent of them, who were below the age of 28 were first-time employees.

PM Modi also cited the data showing increase in the registration of employees under the National Pension Scheme (NPS) from 65 lakh in March 2014 to 1.2 crore till October 2018.

Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct as it can be formalisation of informal jobs, said Mahesh Vyas, Chief Executive Officer of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a think tank.

""When a person enrols for the EPF, it does not necessarily mean that the person has got a job. It is quite likely that you have enrolled for the EPF for the first time though you had a job for a long time,"" he said.

""The law requires an employer with 20 people or more to register with the EPFO. If a firm has got 19 employees till yesterday and today 20th person joins in, then all 20 get enrolled for the first time. So it looks like employment has gone up by 20 when actually it is one.""

Another expert, who did not wish to be named, said there cannot be a correlation between EPF enrolment and job creation ""since it has so many moving parts and variables, so one could interpret it differently"".

PM Modi also had said that new 6.35 lakh new non-corporate tax payers such as doctors must have provided jobs in past four years. The expert called it ""incomprehensible"" in the absence of the source of the data.

In his speech, the PM said he expected over 1.25 crore people have got jobs in the transport sector with the sale of 36 lakh commercial vehicles and 27 lakh auto-rickshaws.

He also cited setting up of two lakh service call centres, infrastructure building, hotel constructions and housing activities for the creation of employment in the country.

Mr Vyas said if a farmer takes up a labourer's job or moves to driving a truck, it cannot be considered a new job.

According to the CMIE statistics, India's unemployment rate shot up to 7.4 per cent in December, 2018 and the number of unemployed increased by a substantial 11 million - the highest in 15 months.

PM Modi had taken a dig at the past governments for failing to establish standard system to tally employment and said only 7-8 sectors were taken into account to arrive at the employment rate when, in reality, jobs were created in 100-odd sectors.

Mr Vyas said PM Modi was possibly referring to enterprise survey conducted by the Labour Ministry, which is one of the ways to estimate employment.

""That is not the best way to estimate employment and unemployment in country like India. But what the Prime Minister did not mention was that India also conducted a large house-hold survey. It is the most appropriate way of computing it and will capture all sectors. He is partially right but selective in the kind of survey done,"" he said.

""The traditional way, which is a good way of calculating employment and unemployment, is the NSSO household survey,"" he added.

The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report, which the government has withheld, said the unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, post-demonetisation and was at its highest level since 1972-73 - the period since when the jobs data is comparable.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nsso-unemployment-report-mahesh-vyas-epf-enrolment-income-tax-data-cannot-measure-job-creation-1991205,

Here is your 10-point cheat sheet to this big story:

According to the report, which has not been made public but has been accessed by Business Standard, the unemployment rate was at its highest level since 1972-73. The report says in 2011-12, the unemployment rate stood at 2.2 per cent and youth unemployment is at ""astronomically high"" levels of 13 to 27 per cent. Joblessness was higher in urban areas (7.8 per cent) than in the rural areas (5.3 per cent). More people are withdrawing from the workforce as the labour force participation rate is lower than in the previous years. The NSSO's annual household survey of 2017-18 is the first after the November 2016 demonetisation, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared an overnight ban on high-value notes. The report is at the core of a controversy over the quitting of two members of the National Statistical Commission, including its acting chairman PC Mohanan. PC Mohanan confirmed that one of the reasons why he quit was the delay in the release of the National Sample Survey Office's Periodic Labour Force Survey report. PC Mohanan told NDTV that he and JV Meenakshi, the only non-government members of the statistics body, felt sidelined and ""not taken seriously"". The government today said the ""timing and verification has to be done"". It added: ""We have our process and we have explained to the members."" It did agree that the data showed jobs had been reduced.

4,"Railways Had 63,000 Job Openings. 19 Million People Applied","Railways Jobs: The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum (AFP)

Anil Gujjar arrived in the national capital from a small village in Rajasthan carrying nothing except a backpack and hopes of finding a good job.

The odds were not in his favor. In February, the Indian railways announced a national recruitment drive for the most menial positions in its hierarchy - helper, porter, cleaner, gateman, track maintainer, assistant switchman.

It attracted 19 million applicants for 63,000 vacancies.

Gujjar, the son of a farmer and the first person in his family to attend college, was one of them. At the test center in Delhi where he took a mandatory exam in November, he looked around warily at hundreds of young men like him. Nearly all were college students or graduates. Some even had master's degrees.

Indian Railways Jobs: Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016 (AFP)

The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, but it is not generating enough jobs - let alone good jobs - for the increasingly educated young people entering the labor force.

By 2021, the number of people in the country between the ages of 15 and 34 is expected to reach 480 million. They have higher levels of literacy and are staying in school longer than any previous generation of Indians. The youth surge represents an opportunity for the country of 1.3 billion, economists say, but only if such young people can find productive work.

Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016. Jobless rates for young people and those with higher educational qualifications increased during the same period, in some cases sharply: The unemployment rate for college graduates jumped from 4.1 percent to 8.4 percent, according to Santosh Mehrotra, a well-known labor economist.

The fate of millions of job-seekers represents a major political liability for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks reelection this year. PM Modi came to power almost five years ago promising ""development for all"" and robust job creation. But his attempts to increase manufacturing and entrepreneurship have not succeeded in turbocharging employment.

Economic growth created fewer jobs in recent years (WP)

Meanwhile, PM Modi's controversial move in late 2016 to invalidate most of the bank notes - ostensibly to stem corruption - had a deleterious impact on workers. About 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research firm in Mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. Its data also showed that the labor force shrank between 2017 and 2018 - not a sign of a healthy job market.

""India is rapidly losing an opportunity,"" said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the research firm. ""We're just arguing needlessly and endlessly rather than deploying all these young people coming into the labor market into productive work."" The result is a ""slow and insidious crisis,"" he said.

For many young people, finding a job is an all-consuming task. An entire industry has sprung up offering ""personality development"" classes - a combination of basic English, social skills and interview preparation advertised as improving employability. Job scams are common, with fraudsters preying on the aspirations of those seeking work.

Educated young men do not want to be ""pakora wallahs"" - people who make the quintessential fried snack - said Radhicka Kapoor, an economist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. ""They want good, productive jobs, and they're going to wait it out until they in fact find these jobs.""

Jobs In Railways: Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry (Representational)

Ajit Ghose, an economist at the Institute for Human Development in Delhi, says that India needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce - who number 6 million to 8 million a year, according to his estimate - but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that paid a decent wage. Ghose has calculated that India has at least 104 million such ""surplus"" workers.

That's a monumental challenge for any government - and one that the leadership is not meeting. Judging the Modi government's track record on job creation is complicated by the fact that it has not released any comprehensive nationwide employment data since 2016. The Labor and Statistics ministries have conducted more-recent employment surveys of households, but those results have not been made public.

""It's anybody's guess whether we'll see any employment statistics come out before the 2019 elections,"" said Amit Basole, an economist at Azim Premji University.

Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry. Meanwhile, he said, his sense was that concerns about job creation are ""overblown,"" given the country's high rates of economic growth.

For educated youths, searching for a job that meets their aspirations can feel like a marathon. At the test center in Delhi, waves of applicants for the railway positions arrived three times a day, each weekday, from September through mid-December - a scene replicated at hundreds of exam centers across the country.

The flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. One entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. Since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam center, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of Rs 50. A vendor sold tube socks and ear buds on the sidewalk.

The railway jobs on offer - sometimes referred to as Group D positions - are junior but offer security and a comparatively good salary. The starting pay is Rs 18,000 a month, plus there are perks such as free train travel.

The stories of the young men - and they were all men, with one exception, at a test center in Delhi over two days - are striking in their sameness. The applicants are mostly college students and college graduates from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who are seeking a way out of the villages where they grew up. There are no jobs there, they said.

Gujjar arrived in Delhi for the first time in his life the evening before his 9 am exam. He spent the night sleeping on a sheet that he spread on the floor of the railway station. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the exam center, where he stood, waiting, in a thin striped sweater, arms crossed against the predawn chill. At 7:35 am, a guard carrying a portable loudspeaker began barking instructions to the assembled test-takers.

Too anxious for chitchat, Gujjar declined to describe how he felt at that moment. ""Ask me after I see the exam paper,"" he said. The posts at Indian Railways held no inherent appeal, he explained. ""It's not about interest,"" he said. ""I just want a job.""

Gujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. A year ago, he tried to join the Indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. There are no opportunities in his village in the district of Jhunjhunu, he said, and most of his friends do not have steady work.

After taking the 90-minute computerized test, Gujjar strode through a blue metal gate with a smile of relief on his face. The exam was not as difficult as he had feared. It will be months before he knows whether he has beaten the odds, which are roughly 1 in 300. ""If I get a job, it will be worth it,"" he said.

5,13 Million Jobs Created In 2017: Member Of Economic Advisory Council,"1.7 to 3 million jobs could have been created by the construction sector alone in FY18.

Twenty-two million jobs have been created during 2014-2017, with 13 million new jobs in 2017 alone, according to a report. Surjit Bhalla, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) and the author of the report, says that the goals of the report are to gauge job creation in 2017 in the absence of a comprehensive public survey, and to predict how many new jobs are needed every year.

The report goes on to say that reforms under the current government, like the MUDRA scheme and the boost in road construction activity have pushed up employment. It goes on to claim that 1.7 to 3 million jobs could have been created by the construction sector alone in financial year 2017-18.

Mr. Bhalla rejected the common assumption that 10 to 12 million new jobs are needed annually in India, stating that these figures are dated and were last correct in 2004. According to the report, only 7.5 million new jobs were required in 2017 to maintain the unemployment percentage.

The report draws on two kinds of government surveys and a private survey for its analysis. The private survey, carried out by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange, found that only 1.7 million new jobs were created in 2017, in contrast to the new report's figure of 13 million. Mr Bhalla has criticised this survey and claimed that there are ""mega inconsistencies"" in the CMIE survey.

The report also looks into the drop in women's labour force participation rate that has been reported by the CMIE. It states that half the drop in women's jobs is ""artificial"" as it has been caused by women pursuing education, and the the drop runs parallel to a similar drop in men's labour force participation rate.

Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the IMF today exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country.""Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,"" International Monetary Fund spokesperson, Gerry Rice said.Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards.""Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,"" Mr Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth.In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. ""We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,"" he said.And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India's long-term growth but create jobs as well, Mr Rice said.""So we think, all of this will help to spur India's continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,"" Mr Rice said.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unemployment-major-challenge-for-india-international-monetary-fund-1830457,

Leaders like Narendra Modi and Donald Trump are being elected all over the world because people are in pain due to unemployment, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said today, but stressed that even the prime minister was not doing enough to solve the key problem facing India.Mr Gandhi, 47, who is in the US on a two-week-long tour, during his interaction with students at the prestigious Princeton University admitted that the Narendra Modi-led BJP came to power in India because people were angry with the Congress party over the issue of unemployment.Employment is an all-encompassing means to empower, enfranchise and involve Indians in the nation building process, he said.""I think, the central reason why Mr Modi arose and to an extent why Mr Trump came, is the question of jobs in India and in the United States. There's a large part of our populations that simply do not have jobs and cannot see a future. And, so they are feeling pain. And they have supported these types of leaders,"" Mr Gandhi told students.He said the another problem is that nobody was recognising that unemployment was a problem. ""I do not know (Donald) Trump. I don't go there. But, certainly our prime minister is not doing enough (in creating jobs),"" Mr Gandhi said.Mr Gandhi has repeatedly raised the issue of joblessness during his meetings with experts, business leaders and Congressmen in the United States.""Currently, we are not producing enough jobs. 30,000 new youngsters are joining the job market every single day and yet the government is only creating 500 jobs a day. And this doesn't include the massive pool of already unemployed youngsters,"" Mr Gandhi had said in his earlier address at the University of California in Berkeley.At Princeton, Mr Gandhi said India needed to transform itself to compete with China, and for that the people in the country required jobs.""Those same people who got angry with us because we couldn't deliver on those 30,000 jobs (a day) are going to get angry with Mr Modi. The central question is resolving that problem. My main issue with Mr Modi is that he diverts that issue and points the finger somewhere else instead of saying listen we have a problem,"" he said.""There is anger building up in India right now. We can sense it. So to me the challenge is how to solve that job growth problem in a democratic environment. That is the challenge,"" he said.""So we have to first accept it as a problem. Then we have to unite and try to solve it. Right now, nobody is even accepting it as a problem,"" he argued.Focusing a major part of his question and answer session at Princeton on jobs, Mr Gandhi asserted that new technologies and modernisation are unlikely to kill jobs.""The nature of what we call it a blue collar job is going to change. But the question is who is going to have those jobs and which countries are going to have access to those jobs,"" he said.Mr Gandhi also raised the issue of ""polarisation in India"". He said that the ""politics of polarisation"" was a central challenge in India and some sections of the society, including the minority communities and tribal people, who do not feel that they are a part of the ruling BJP's vision.""In the 21st century, if you leave some people out of your vision, you are asking for trouble. New ideas would come, new different visions would develop. So, to me, central challenge in India is politics of polarisation where you pit one community against the other and you create spaces for other people to come in,"" Mr Gandhi said.""There is a belt of 100 million tribal people who do not feel comfortable with the vision (of the BJP). There are a number of states in India, which don't want a single vision forced down their throat. There are minority communities, they do not feel that they are a part of the vision.

8,"Underemployment More Serious Than Unemployment, Says NITI Aayog","The NITI Aayog has warned about underemployment, saying it is more dangerous than unemployment

""Severe underemployment"" and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, the government think tank NITI Aayog said in a report.The opposition Congress party recently claimed that unemployment was rising in India and criticised the Narendra Modi government.In its draft action report that covers three years from fiscal 2018 to 2020, the NITI Aayog stressed on the need for creating high-productivity and high-wage jobs. ""Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India's problems. The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment. A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,"" NITI Aayog said in the report.The draft report was circulated among the think tank's Governing Council members comprising all chief ministers and other officials on April 23.The NITI Aayog said the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which tracks India's employment situation, has consistently reported low but stable rate of unemployment for over three decades, which goes contrary to assertions that India's growth has not been driven by job growth.The NITI Aayog, quoting an NSSO report, said that in fiscal 2012, 49 per cent of India's workforce was employed in agriculture, but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India's Gross Domestic Product at current prices.In fiscal 2011, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India's manufacturing workforce, but contributed only 12 per cent to manufacturing output, the NITI Aayog said in the report.An NSSO survey of service firms in fiscal 2007 found that the 650 largest companies accounted for 38 per cent of services output, but only employed two per cent of service workers, the NITI Aayog said.""Put another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the workforce but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,"" the report said. Citing the example of China's ageing workforce, the NITI Aayog called for taking steps to attract big companies from China to India, which can provide a large number of workers at competitive wages.""The experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers,"" the NITI Aayog report said.""The Make in India campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,"" it said. The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many big firms in labour-intensive sectors in that country are scouting for lower-wage locations. ""With its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,"" the NITI Aayog report said.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/underemployment-serious-than-unemployment-says-niti-aayog-1704808,

BJP President Amit Shah on Friday said the Narendra Modi government is the ""most decisive and transparent"" the country has seen, without a single case of corruption against it, and its rule in the last three years has ended casteism, family rule and appeasement politics. Addressing a press conference to mark the third anniversary of the Modi government , Mr Shah said what could not be achieved in the last 70 years was achieved by this government in the short period. He also brushed aside concerns over unemployment, saying it was not possible to give jobs to every person in a country of 125 crore.""We have tried to give new perspective to employment as it is not possible to provide employment to everyone in a country of 125 crore people. We are promoting self-employment and the government has made eight crore people self-employed,"" Mr Shah told reporters.The comments came amid renewed attack by the Opposition on the government's employment numbers.""Modi government had promised to give employment to two crore youths annually but actually it had been able to give jobs to only 1.35 lakh people in 2015 and in 2016 too it could give jobs to about as many people,"" Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said at a press conference yesterday.But slamming the previous Congress-led UPA government, Mr Shah said the earlier political establishment was marked by policy paralysis and a string of scams. In contrast, even the opposition parties have not been able to level a single charge of corruption against the Modi government, he claimed.""The BJP government under Modiji is the most decisive and transparent government, not a paralysed government,"" Mr Shah said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government is celebrating three years in office this month in events scheduled for three weeks.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about doing 'surya namaskar' for strengthening his back. It would be good if he could suggest a similar 'asana' to unemployed youngsters,"" he said.

""Unemployment is rising in the country. The prime minister does not have any time to think about it. At least he could suggest an 'asana', "" he added.

PM Modi had hit out at opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, whom he dubbed as a ""tubelight"", saying it took him 30-40 minutes to respond to his speech in the Lok Sabha.

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, the prime minister, in his reply to the discussion on the presidential address, referred to the Congress leader's comments about ""youngsters beating up Modi with sticks over the lack of jobs"", and said he would increase the number of ""surya namaskar"" so that his back could bear the sticks.

""In these six months, I will do more surya namaskar so that my back is ready for the beating.... I have been subjected to abuses in the last 20 years, I will make myself gaali-proof as also danda-proof,"" PM Modi had said.

Highlights Report by industry body CII found surge in small business job creation

Report extrapolates findings from just one sector, survey in few states

Report contradicts others which claim high unemployment, shrinking sector

Amid a swirling debate over unemployment in India ahead of general elections next month, a recently released survey by top industry body, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which reported a surge in job creation in India's small businesses, found favour with the government.

A number of ministers - from Railways Minister Piyush Goyal to Information Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore tweeted the findings of the report, which found that job creation in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector had grown by 14 per cent from 2014-18, the first 4 years of the Modi government.

The finding startled observers, given the mass of data, official and private, which suggested a deepening of India's unemployment problem, as well as a slowdown of the small businesses sector.

An analysis of the CII report throws up a number of questions over its findings and methodology.

The CII admits that its sample for the survey, of one lakh firms, is heavily skewed towards India's more advanced states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. The number of firms polled in these states amount, respectively, to 25 per cent, 12 per cent and 8 per cent of the total survey. The basis for greater 'bias' to these states, according to the survey, is because of higher employee provident fund enrolments in these states.

But government data shows that the share of MSME's in these three states is far less, at 8 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, much lower than states such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

The CII report found that between 2014 and 2018, job creation grew at 3.3 per cent annually in the MSME sector.

However the government's own data from the ministry of MSME, shows that between 2006 and 2016, the annual growth rate of employment in the MSME sector was 3.6 per cent, a touch higher than the CII's number.

Eight of those 10 years predate the Modi government.

The survey has also invited criticism for projecting the total job growth in the country using its study of the MSME sector.

According to the CII study, the total workforce in the country is 450 million. ""A simple extrapolation of the findings from the survey (of 3.3 per cent job growth in MSMEs) on macro-level data indicates that 13.5 - 14.9 million (1.3 -1.5 crore) jobs were created per annum,"" the survey states.

This is flawed reasoning, argue experts, given that every sector grows at a different pace. For instance, the annual job growth in the manufacturing sector was 1 per cent while, in the construction sector was -3 per cent between October 2016 and 2017.

The correct method would have been to project job creation on the basis of the size of the workforce employed by the MSME sector alone, which is 110 million (according to government data), not 450 million.

Attempts to seek a response from CII were unsuccessful.

""CII is a pretty well established organisation and I think it is important that its credibility is not damaged too much. Anyone who does a survey would very easily indicate that there are many problems in this,"" Mahesh Vyas, MD and CEO of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cii-jobs-report-multiple-anomalies-emerge-in-new-jobs-surge-report-tweeted-by-ministers-2007068,

""During the 2014 elections, PM Modi had promised ''Acche Din'' (good days), which included (providing) two crore jobs every year. In five years, this sums up to 10 crore (jobs).

His views were supported by his boss, Niti Aayog's Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant. ""The story of jobs is all over this budget. You cannot have growth without distributed prosperity,"" Mr Kant said.

The opposition Congress has contended that ""jobs"" was one of the two words missing from the interim budget, which, they said was the government's ""last jumla (political gimmick)"" and ""political manifesto"" before the national elections due by May.

Yesterday, Business Standard newspaper reported that the unemployment rate in the country was at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. The data it quoted was from the National Sample Survey Office's periodic labour force survey.

Two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission, which vets the report, had quit on Tuesday, accusing the centre of withholding its release.

Calling the opposition claims on rising unemployment a ""political gimmick"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that over 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone, in the last one year.

Based on Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data, more than 45 lakh formal jobs were created between September 2017 and April 2018, PM Modi said in an email interview to The Times of India published on Sunday.

""According to our study based on the EPFO data, more than 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone last year,"" he said.

Attacking the opposition, he said that rather than the so-called failure of this government to create jobs, ""I believe the shortcoming lies in the absence or lack of a streamlined database of jobs. Naturally, in the absence of information, our opponents will exploit this situation and blame us for not creating jobs"".

PM Modi also called the opposition's claim of rising unemployment a ""propaganda"".

""If you look at claims made by the state governments -- Bengal says it created 68 lakh jobs and the previous Karnataka government claimed it created 53 lakh jobs -- are we saying that all the country's jobs are being created in some states and that other states and the country as a whole are not creating jobs? This propaganda on jobs by the opposition is nothing but a political gimmick,"" he said.

PM Modi said that informal sector accounts for around 80 per cent of all jobs and creation of jobs in the formal sector has a spin-off effect on job creation in the informal sector.

""There are close to three lakh village-level entrepreneurs who run common service centres across the country and create employment. More than 12 crore loans have been given under MUDRA Scheme,"" he said.

PM Modi said that in the last four years, construction roads, railways and residential areas was undertaken and that led to generation of jobs.

21,Unemployment In India To Increase Marginally In 2017-18: Report,"Highlights Job creation in India not expected to pick up in 2017, 2018, says report

Unemployment in India projected to rise marginally in 2017, 2018

India performed slightly well in job creation in 2016, UN report adds

United Nations: Unemployment in India is projected to witness marginal increase between 2017 and 2018, signalling stagnation in job creation in the country, according to a UN labour report.



The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) released its 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report yesterday, which finds economic growth trends lagging behind employment needs and predicts both rising unemployment and worsening social inequality throughout 2017.



Job creation in India is not expected to pick up pace in 2017 and 2018 as unemployment rises slightly, representing a near stagnation in percentage terms.



""Unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7 million last year to 17.8 million in 2017 and 18 million next year. In percentage terms, unemployment rate will remain at 3.4 per cent in 2017-18,"" the report added.



India had performed slightly well in terms of job creation in 2016, when a ""majority"" of the 13.4 million new employment created in Southern Asia happened in the country.



The report also acknowledged that India's 7.6 per cent growth in 2016 helped Southern Asia achieve 6.8 per cent growth that year.



""Manufacturing growth has underpinned India's recent economic performance, which may help buffer demand for the region's commodity exporters,"" it added.



The report added that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent (from 5.7 per cent in 2016) - representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017).



""We are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labour market entrants every year,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.



The increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries - as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017.





The number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 (during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016), it said.""Almost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,"" said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.That statistic is even worse for emerging countries.Those living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing the greatest risk. In contrast, unemployment is expected to fall in 2017 in developed countries (by 670,000), bringing the rate down to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2016.In Europe, notably Northern, Southern and Western Europe, unemployment levels and rates are both expected to continue to fall, but the pace of improvement will slow, and there are signs that structural unemployment is worsening.The ILO advocates policy approaches that address root causes of secular stagnation as well as structural impediments to growth.""Boosting economic growth in an equitable and inclusive manner requires a multi-faceted policy approach that addresses the underlying causes of secular stagnation, such as income inequality, while taking into account country specificities,"" said Tobin.Such progress, the ILO emphasised, is only possible through international cooperation. A coordinated effort to provide fiscal stimuli and public investments would go a long way to provide an immediate jump start to the global economy and could eliminate an anticipated rise in unemployment for two million people.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-in-india-to-increase-marginally-in-2017-18-report-1648457,
22,"More Workers, Fewer Jobs in World's Fastest Growing Economy","A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015

Highlights A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds

Job creation is a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old

It's been two years since India emerged as the world's fastest-growing major economy, but the rapid expansion has done little to improve the lot of Ashok Kumar.



Parked up and sitting on the kerb, the 25-year-old truck driver is going nowhere fast. He is the sole breadwinner for the 13 people in his extended family and his monthly salary is stuck at $150 (Rs 10,000).



With new, better-paid jobs hard to come by, Kumar lacks options. He fears becoming unemployed like his elder brother, who recently returned to their village in in Uttar Pradesh after months of searching in vain for work.



Data out on Wednesday showed India's economic growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in the quarter to June, a 15-month low. That is faster than other major economies, but not fast enough to create enough new jobs to absorb all the one million people who join the workforce every month.



A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015. Analysts at HDFC Bank estimate that for every percentage point the economy grows, employment now adds just 0.15 of a percentage point - down from 0.39 in 2000.



It's a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to create 25 crore jobs over the next decade.



""For one job, there are at least 20 candidates,"" said Kumar. ""If you want the job, you can't afford to bargain.""



Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old. This rising demographic ""bulge"" will create the largest working-age population in the world. At the same time China, which has long curbed family size, will age as a society.



Whether this so-called demographic dividend will translate into the kind of economic gains seen in Japan and Korea, or lead to upheavals, depends on India's ability to generate jobs.



Yet, despite average annual growth of 6.5 per cent between 1991 and 2013, India added less than half the jobs needed to absorb new job seekers.



MORE WORKERS, FEWER JOBS



Under PM Modi, India has opened up further to foreign investment, hoping to generate more manufacturing jobs. A loan scheme for small businesses has been set up and there are plans for a $1.5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore) fund for startups.

PM Modi has also launched a programme to train over 40 lakh people in different skills in six years.Pronab Sen, country director for the International Growth Centre, a British-backed think tank, said such measures were ""laudable"", but they aimed at boosting supply when more demand was needed.""India has become a demand-starved economy,"" Sen said. ""If there is no demand, there will be no incentive to produce more which, in turn, will mean no new jobs.""The level of desperation for work is staggering. In August, nearly half a million people, including post-graduates, applied for 1,778 jobs as sweepers in the city of Kanpur.This was not a one-off. Last year, in Uttar Pradesh, 2.3 million people sought 368 low-level government jobs that required a primary education and ability to ride a bicycle.Competition for such jobs has become fiercer as the public sector's share in formal employment is declining.Two years of drought has caused distress in farming, while the construction business has suffered a prolonged downturn - making work scarcer in the two sectors that employ the bulk of India's unskilled workforce.Satellite cities around Delhi, like Greater Noida were, until recently, bustling with construction activity.Now, Greater Noida's skyline is dotted with half-built, abandoned, high-rises.

Across India, starts were down 9 per cent from a year earlier.Bhuwan Mahato, a contractor who supplies workers to construction projects around Noida, says demand for labour is down by at least 25 per cent.""I wish I hadn't joined this business,"" said Mahato, a 30-year-old migrant from the state of Bihar.

India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37 per cent in February from 5.97 per cent in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65 per cent from 9.70 per cent, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-news-february-jobless-rate-rises-to-7-78-highest-in-4-months-says-think-tank-cmie-2188403,
24,"Unemployment Rate At 9.3% In March Quarter, Lowest In 4 Years","The unemployment figures for the first quarter of this year are out and there is a slight reason for cheer for a government facing the biggest flak for not generating enough jobs.

The urban unemployment rate fell to 9.3 per cent between January and March this year, the lowest in at least four quarters. It stood at 9.9 per cent in the previous quarter, says a survey by the National Statistical Organisation. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available in the Periodic Labour Force Survey and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.

The estimates are worked out on what is called current weekly status method. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.

Joblessness among youth aged between 15 and 29 years was at 22.5 per cent during the January-March period this year, down from 23.7 per cent in the previous quarter. This segment accounts for over one third of India's 1.3 billion people.

The Narendra Modi government has been criticised for not regularly releasing comprehensive data on jobs. Figures had shown joblessness at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The labour force participation rate - the percentage of population that supplies labour force for all economic activity - was 36 per cent during the March quarter, the survey showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.

India's economic growth fell to an over four-year low of 5.8% in the January-March period. It fell further to 5 per cent in the following quarter.

The survey also showed that of the total workforce, 37.7 per cent were self-employed, 50 per cent were salaried or regular workers and 12.4 per cent were casual labourers.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-rate-declines-to-9-3-per-cent-in-jan-mar-2019-2138260,
25,Urban Unemployment Rate Drops To Lowest In 4 Quarters: Government Data,"The NSO said urban unemployment rate was 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018

Amid criticism over high unemployment rate, a survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Saturday showed that urban unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in four quarters at 9.3 per cent during January-March 2019.

The quarterly bulletin of Periodic Labour Force Survey by the NSO, released on Saturday, does not contain comparable figure for January-March 2018.

The NSO, which is a wing of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, stated in the bulletin that the urban unemployment rate (UR) was 9.9 per cent in April-June 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018.

The first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ending December 2018 was brought out in May 2019. This bulletin for the March 2019 quarter is the second in the series. The data showed that UR in urban areas among males was at 8.7 per cent during January-March 2019.

This unemployment rate among male in urban areas was 9 per cent in April-June 2018, 8.9 per cent in July-September and 9.2 per cent in October-December last year. For women, the UR was at 11.6 per cent during January-March 2019.

While this rate for women during April-June 2018 was 12.8 per cent, in July-September was 12.7 per cent and in October-December last year was 12.3 per cent.

The government had been receiving criticism for high unemployment rates amid slowing economic growth. In May this year, government data had shown that unemployment rate in the country was 6.1 per cent of total labour force during 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The survey on Saturday pointed out that the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) was estimated as 36 per cent in the urban areas during January-March 2019, as compared to 35.6 per cent during April- June 2018. The LFPR was 36.1 per cent in July-September and 36.3 per cent in October-December last year.

The LFPR for men was estimated to be 56.2 per cent, while for women it was at 15 per cent in the urban areas during the January-March 2019 period.

The LFPR for men was 56 per cent in April-June, 56.3 in July September and 56.4 in October-December last year.

Similarly, the LFPR for women was 14.6 per cent in April-June and 15.3 in July-September and 15.4 per cent in October-December last year. This indicates that women participation in employment has improved slightly till October-December last year but deteriorated a little bit in January-March 2019.

Labour force refers to the part of the population which supplies or offers to supply labour for pursuing economic activities for the production of goods and services and, therefore, includes both ""employed"" and ""unemployed"" persons.

The LFPR is defined as the percentage of population in the labour-force. Labour-force according to current weekly status (CWS) is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of 7 days preceding the date of survey. In Statement 1, LFPR in CWS are presented.

The country's unemployment rate was at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the statistics ministry said on Friday, confirming the figure leaked to Business Standard newspaper in January, which said it was the highest since 1972-73. The data was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn-in for his second term. The BJP won a huge majority in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several years, and the government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate. ""It's a new design, new metric... It would be unfair to compare it with the past,"" chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters.

Business Standard, which first reported the figure in January, had said that it was based on an assessment carried out by the National Sample Survey Office between July 2017 and June 2018.

The unemployment rate was the highest since 1972-73, the newspaper reported without giving a figure for that fiscal year.

The statistics ministry also said that female labour participation rate in urban areas for the quarter ending December 2018 was 19.5 per cent, compared with 73.6 per cent for males.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8 per cent in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years.

Unemployment and the economy had been pitched as major issues by the Congress during the campaign for the national elections. However, the party faced a crushing defeat in the elections, winning just 52 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha.

28,"50 Lakh Lost Jobs Over 2 Years, Trend Began Just After Notes Ban: Report","A government report leaked earlier this year said unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

Highlights Azim Premji University in Bengaluru released a report on jobs

Job losses are higher when women are taken into account, report says

A government report said unemployment rate at 45-year high in 2017-18

Fifty lakh men lost their jobs in the past two years beginning November 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an overnight ban on high value currency, according to a new report. The timing of the start of the decline in jobs coincides with demonetisation but no ""causal link"" can be established based on the available data, says the ""State of Working India 2019"", released Tuesday by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.

The job losses are higher when women are taken into account.

""Whether or not this decline was caused by demonetisation, it is definitely a cause for concern and calls for urgent policy intervention,"" the report says.

It assesses that unemployment, in general, has risen steadily post 2011 and the higher educated and the young are vastly over-represented among the unemployed.

In addition to open employment among the educated, the less educated have seen job losses and reduced work opportunities over this time period. The numbers, says the report, clearly demonstrate why unemployment has emerged as the primary economic issue in the election.

A government report leaked earlier this year had said the country's unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

The National Sample Survey Office's Periodic Labour Force Survey, conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73. The report was withheld by the government but accessed by the Business Standard newspaper.

But NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said the report was ""not verified"" and the ""veracity of the data is not known"".

The latest report says the decline in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and workforce participation rate (WPR) has largely been driven by less-educated men in both urban and rural areas.

""Clearly, there is a large differential impact by level of education. This is consistent with the idea that the informal sector, where we can expect the share of less educated men to be higher, was hit hardest by demonetisation as well as the introduction of GST.""

The report says joblessness is not only a problem limited to the educated sections of the labour force. ""While open unemployment may still be low among the less educated, there has been a marked tendency to drop out of the labour force for this section, presumably due to loss of work opportunities,"" it says.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/50-lakh-lost-jobs-over-2-years-trend-began-just-after-notes-ban-report-2024268,
29,"""Jobs Dipping Amid 7.5% Growth?"": Arun Jaitley Junks ""Unverified"" Report","Arun Jaitley maintained that the NSSO report cannot be taken at face value.

Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday brushed aside a leaked report that suggested a four-decade high in unemployment rate under the Narendra Modi government, terming it as an ""unverified draft"" that cannot be taken at face value. ""I don't think that is a report. It's a draft that has not been approved,"" he said.

The Union Minister, who is currently hospitalised in the United States, put forth a few numbers to drive home his point. ""If 7.5% is the real growth in Gross Domestic Product, and inflation is at 3-4%, the nominal growth needs to be around 11-12%. It would be absurd to say that there are no jobs in such a scenario,"" he said, referring to the controversial National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) findings.

According to the NSSO report, India's unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18 -- the most since the early seventies. It also found that unemployment was higher in urban areas (7.8%) then rural zones (5.3%), and youth unemployment was at ""astronomically high"" levels of 13% to 27%. The report further claimed that more people were withdrawing from the workforce because the labour force participation rate is lower than in previous years.

Controversy arose after two non-independent members quit the data-collating body on Tuesday, alleging that the government was averse to releasing the report despite vetting by the National Statistical Commission in December. Congress president Rahul Gandhi used the issue to compare Prime Minister Narendra Modi to German dictator Adolf Hitler. ""NoMo Jobs! The Fuhrer promised us 2 Cr jobs a year. 5 years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a National Disaster. Unemployment is at its highest in 45 yrs. 6.5 Cr youth are jobless in 2017-18 alone. Time for NoMo2Go,"" he tweeted.

Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal linked it to the demonetisation initiative, calling it a ""mega scam"" orchestrated by the Union government.

Defending the government was planning body Niti Aayog, with its head -- Amitabh Kant -- asserting that the demand for jobs was being met. ""You can't be growing at 7.2 per cent and say no jobs are being created. To my mind, the major problem is the lack of quality jobs,"" he said.

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal also made a similar claim.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised two crore jobs every year in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.
