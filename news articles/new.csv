0,0,"Comprehensive employment, industrial policies are necessary to address jobs crisis","since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image) since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image)

A report in this paper (IE, November 1) on various employment estimates for 2017-18, based on the PLFS (periodic labour force survey) data, has received considerable attention. We have received several queries from policy makers regarding the differences in our employment estimates with studies by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey (BD), and Himanshu that are quoted in the report. In this article, we clarify the reasons for the differences and highlight the major findings of our study.

First, our estimates are different from that of BD because theirs are based only on the usual principal status (UPS) of employment. Our study is based on both usual principal and subsidiary status (UPSS) of employment. Since Himanshu‚Äôs estimates are also based on UPSS, our figures are not much different except for the 2017-18 PLFS figures. Himanshu‚Äôs and our estimates for employment in both 2004-05 and 2011-12 are almost the same (the negligible difference is because of the use of population multipliers that differ at second and third decimal points). The discrepancy with Himanshu‚Äôs 2017-18 employment figure is only because he probably used a lower population multiplier based on a projected total population of 1.33 billion.

But, while comparing Himanshu‚Äôs estimates with that of BD for 2017-18, we find that both their figures are the same (this is surprising since BD have ignored the subsidiary status of employment unlike Himanshu). We have explored why this has happened. BD have used a projected population of close to 1.36 billion based on their argument that the annual population growth of India was about 1.7 per cent between 2011-12 and 2017-18. This is a very high overestimation of India‚Äôs population growth rate during this period. The World Bank‚Äôs population projection (available at World Development Indicators) shows that annual population growth in India was only 1.2 per cent per annum in 2012 and 1.04 per cent in 2018, and the total population was about 1.34 billion in 2017-18. Our population projections (based on a monthly exponential growth rate) show that the total population in India was about 1.345 billion in 2017-18 (the same as the World Bank‚Äôs estimate).

The National Family Health Survey 2015-16 shows that there has been a phenomenal decline in the total fertility rate (the number of children born to women in the reproductive age group of 15-49), reaching a near replacement rate of 2.2 per woman, from 2.7 in 2005-06. Hence, the 1.06 per cent population growth rate we use is logical; and 1.7 per cent cannot be India‚Äôs current population growth rate. The use of the latter artificially raises the workforce number that BD came up with, 457 million in 2017-18. This is surprising since they had missed out on subsidiary workers altogether. Hence, they fail to find that the total jobs in India fell by nine million in six years, a first in India‚Äôs history.

Moreover, since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. The principal employment status is recorded for a relatively longer duration of time in the survey year (normally for a period of six months and more). It leaves out those who work for less than six months, and who must also be counted among those working. The subsidiary status of employment data (covering those working 30 days but less than 182 days), covers those not employed in the principal status, and must be added to workers in principal status. So, by ignoring the subsidiary employment, BD provide an incomplete and incorrect employment trend for India.

Hence, BD‚Äôs claim that manufacturing employment during 2011-12 and 2017-18 was ‚Äústagnant‚Äù is also misleading. In fact, based on the UPSS, we found that manufacturing employment actually declined by three million between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. While labour intensive sub-sectors were mainly responsible for this decline, a few capital intensive manufacturing sub-sectors did register consistent growth of jobs during 2004-05 and 2017-2018. Although the quality of jobs is very poor in the services sector, it has played a major role in driving job growth, but only partly offsetting the fall in employment in agriculture, manufacturing, and slowing employment creation in the construction sector. In fact, because of their problematic methodology, BD fail to notice the actual fall in total employment (including self-employment of the Ola/Uber or Mudra variety, which is captured in a comprehensive sample of the unorganised and organised sector workers).

The share of regular and formal employment increased marginally due to growth of formal jobs in the private sector, but the share of informal jobs (without social security) within the government/public sector has increased. A dominant and rising share of jobs is still generated by micro and small units in the unorganised sectors without any formal or written job contract. In both government and private sectors, the number of contract jobs (with no written contract, or less than a year‚Äôs contract, or one to three-years contract) is on the rise post 2011-12. Although BD‚Äôs paper also reveals the same story, we differ from them on the absolute number of jobs. The rate of growth of jobs in the unorganised component is much higher than in the organised sector (those with more than 10 workers).

Moreover, BD‚Äôs research also provides a partial picture of the unemployment trends in India as they could not capture the upsurge in open unemployment among educated youth (which has more than doubled in a matter of six years), nor the recent rise in the disheartened youth labour force (those in the age group of 15-29 and not in educational institutions or the labour force). We found that the number of disheartened youth (having secondary and above level of general education, and with technical and vocational qualifications) is rising at an alarming rate.

With total jobs falling at a time when new entrants into the labour force are increasing at an accelerating pace, it is not surprising that real wages have not increased in both rural and urban areas. From now on, entrants into the labour force will increase at an accelerating pace, at least until 2030. Hence, a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy (to boost growth of medium and large firms) is necessary to address the transformation of agrarian workforce, boost real wages, and to ensure industrial development.

1,1,Explained: Is the push towards organised manufacturing the answer to India‚Äôs jobs crisis?,"For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector. For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

In any Budget, there are essentially two main questions that need to be answered. One, what is the outlook on boosting economic growth. Two, what is the status of the fiscal health of the government ‚Äî that is, what is the level of fiscal deficit etc.

This year, however, there is another big question: What can the government do to boost employment in the country.

In the past year, there have been several reports, both official and by independent academics, that have painted a bleak picture on the jobs front. For instance, a 2017-18 National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) survey pegged unemployment at a 45-year high. Other researchers like Mehrotra & Parida as well as Himanshu have shown how the absolute number of ‚Äúemployed‚Äù people witnessed a decline between 2012 and 2018.

For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

Why manufacturing?

It has been argued that between the three broad sectors of the economy ‚Äî agriculture, industry and services ‚Äî it is the industry sector, and within industry, the manufacturing sector that has the highest potential to absorb the surplus labour in the economy.

Agriculture, which engages almost half the Indian workforce, does not grow fast enough and is, as such, not remunerative enough to provide gainful employment to the millions who join India‚Äôs workforce each year. It is for this reason why more and more people have left agriculture and tried to join other sectors of the economy since 2004.

Services is a fast-growing sector and pays well but it places far greater demands on job seekers in terms of skills and education. Often, the rural millions looking for a job find themselves inadequate in terms of delivering in the services sector ‚Äî not without skills education at least.

That leaves the industry, which includes sub-sectors like manufacturing and non-manufacturing (that is, construction and mining etc.). Research shows that the employment elasticity ‚Äî the ability to create new jobs with every additional increase in a sector‚Äôs growth ‚Äî of the manufacturing sector is the highest.

Explaining the Budget, Part-1: How the Union Budget is prepared

What did the past governments do?

For a while now, both UPA and NDA governments have tried to focus on boosting the growth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, in 2011, Congress-led UPA came out with a new National Manufacturing Policy that aimed at raising the share of the manufacturing sector to 25% of the GDP by 2022. The BJP-led NDA too unveiled the Make in India initiative that focussed using manufacturing as the main platform to create jobs.

Each Union Budget tends to focus on measures that will promote manufacturing ‚Äî both big- and small-scale ‚Äî and create jobs.

However, despite such a focussed stand right through the past decade, manufacturing‚Äôs share is still under 17% of the GDP and the jobs situation in the country has only got worse.

What does the data show?

An analysis of the Indian manufacturing sector done by India Ratings shows that manufacturing units in the organised sector are becoming more capital intensive ‚Äî that is the capital-to-labour ratio is increasing. In other words, instead of increasing the number of workers in a unit, owners are choosing to increase the amount of capital.

As Table 1 shows, the trend is of a secular increase over the years. What is worse is that this trend holds true across the board including those sectors such as textiles and leather products that are considered ‚Äúlabour-intensive‚Äù and most capable of creating jobs and soaking up surplus labour (see Tables 2 and 3).

The oddest bit in this trend is that owners of these manufacturing units appear to be increasingly substituting labour with capital even when the return on capital is falling. Data shows that in the organised manufacturing sector profit per unit of capital invested has fallen sharply between 2007-08 and 2017-18.

The flip side of this picture is the decline in India‚Äôs labour productivity growth rate ‚Äî see Table 4

Not surprisingly, this trend of falling labour productivity growth in organised manufacturing has also gone along with a decline in wage growth ‚Äî Table 5

Yet again, this trend of decline in wage growth is largely secular across the board and includes sectors like textiles and leather that could create the maximum jobs.

Explaining the Budget, Part-2: What ails the credibility of India‚Äôs Budget numbers

What is the upshot?

The data shows that in organised manufacturing ‚Äî that is, manufacturing done in the formal sector where workers are covered under labour laws etc. ‚Äî labour productivity growth and wages growth are declining and businesses are increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital.

This raises several questions for policymakers:

1> Why are manufacturing owners increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital? It is important to note that they continue to do so even when the return on capital is falling.

2> If this is the trend, how reasonable is it to assume that boosting manufacturing growth will create more jobs for the Indian youth?

3> The government has been increasingly pushing for ‚Äúorganised‚Äù or formal sector manufacturing but if this trend is anything to go by, is such a push justified?

4> What is the extent to which the lack of significant labour reform is holding back manufacturing from achieving its potential to create jobs?

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stands up to present the Budget on February 1, these are some of the issues she could be expected to address when discussing the growing question mark on unemployment in India.

2,2,It‚Äôs a wage crisis,"At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.

The debate around unemployment is unhelpful ‚Äî since 1947, unemployment has bounced between 3-7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force. But reconciling this mathematical accuracy with our painful poverty ‚Äî it has bounced between 25-75 per cent of our population since 1947, based on your definition of needs, wants and desires ‚Äî needs an understanding of the ‚Äúself-exploitation‚Äù theory proposed by the Russian economist Alexander Chayanov in the 1920s. He convinced Jawaharlal Nehru that small farms are viable because you don‚Äôt have to pay yourself rent or pay a salary to yourself, spouse or kids. I make the case that one, self-exploitation ‚Äî hanging out vella (idle) with low or zero marginal productivity in farms, self-employment or subsistence wage employment ‚Äî has been India‚Äôs labour market shock absorber since 1947. Two, this shock absorber no longer works because Indians born after 1991 expect a living wage (that meets aspirations) rather than a minimum wage (that keeps mind and body together). And three, these higher wage expectations can only be met by transitioning people to higher productivity sectors, geographies, and firms.

Our current debate confuses jobs with wages. Almost every Indian who wants a job has a job but they don‚Äôt get the wages they want or need because they work in unviable sectors (48 per cent of our labour force on farms generates only 13 per cent of the GDP), unviable firms (our 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 19,500 companies with a paid-up capital greater than Rs 10 crore), unviable entrepreneurship (50 per cent of our labour force is not self-employed but self-exploiting), and unviable geographies (2 lakh of our 6 lakh villages have less than 200 people).

Historian Ramachandra Guha reminds us that India may not yet be the most important or powerful country in the world but it is surely the most interesting. Our political parties have created the world‚Äôs largest democracy on the infertile soil of the world‚Äôs most hierarchical society. But we had zero chances of creating the world‚Äôs largest economy on the infertile soil of the economic model articulated by the Avadi Resolution of 1955 and the Second Five Year plan of 1956. High wages need a complex ecosystem of high productivity firms and individuals: IT firms employ only 0.7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force but produce 7 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP. A waiter in Chicago with skills similar to a waiter in Jaipur makes 20 times higher wages because of the productivity of the customers eating at the restaurant, and India‚Äôs 20 million manufacturing SME‚Äôs have at least 25 times lower productivity than Germany‚Äôs 200,000 mittelstand (SMEs).

Essentially, the GDP of 114 million Maharashtrians is more than 204 million people in Uttar Pradesh because Maharashtra is more formalised, industrialised, financialised, urbanised and skilled. Similarly, the GDP of 1.2 billion Indians till 2019 was lower than 66 million Britons because socialism ‚Äî capitalism without competition and bankruptcy ‚Äî led to nutty economics after 1947. Three books ‚Äî Capitalism in America; A History by Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap by Yuen Yuen Ang, and Lost Glory; India‚Äôs Capitalism Story by Sumit Majumdar ‚Äî talk about choices and consequences. America amplified prosperity (35 per cent of people in official poverty have air-conditioning and 60 per cent have a car), China has used markets to move 700 million people out of poverty since 1978, while our licence-raj bred inefficiency. Politician Vasant Sathe pointed out in the 1980s that India‚Äôs public sector steel industry employed 10 times more people to produce half the steel of South Koreans.

But India is breaking with its past. We have six million new registered enterprises after GST and 30 million new social security payers in three years. Our new monetary policy committee and fiscal discipline have blunted inflation from 8.33 per cent in 2014 to 2.19 per cent. Our new bankruptcy law has started recycling assets of Rs 14 lakh crore. In the 1960s, the-then RBI governor L K Jha had presciently warned that resource utilisation is as important as resource mobilisation. Digital payments have exploded from 0.1 million the month before demonetisation to 650 million last month. Infrastructure spending has doubled in the last five years accompanied by qualitative improvements in air connectivity, ports, highways and railways. Finally, a modern state is a welfare state with a broad tax base; India has more than a crore new individual tax filers since demonetisation with a 45 per cent increase in returns with incomes below Rs 10 lakh last year.

For India‚Äôs 25th birthday in 1972, the late Sheila Dhar wrote a wonderful book, This India that suggested, ‚ÄúIndians have great patience. It is not in their nature to be in a hurry. They can wait longer, suffer more and work harder than other people.‚Äù This paragraph would probably change for the 75th birthday version in 2022; the impatience of our young is changing India and her politics. And thankfully, our democracy means that the Chinese communist party strategy articulated in the 1980s ‚Äî fill their stomachs but empty their minds ‚Äî will not work in India. India‚Äôs youth don‚Äôt aspire to replace self-exploitation with the patronising pessimism of loan-write offs, subsidies or income without work; they recognise that a hard day‚Äôs work in a formal job provides dignity, strength, identity and purpose in addition to living wages.

At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. In 1910, Tagore articulated this vision in ‚ÄòChitto Jetha Bhoyshunno‚Äô hoping his country would awake to a freedom where tireless striving stretches its arms to perfection. The end of our acceptance of self-exploitation embodies a freedom that would please the great sentinel. India‚Äôs challenge is not jobs but employed poverty and while there is much unfinished work, it‚Äôs delusional to believe we aren‚Äôt making good progress. And it is unhelpful presentism to believe that policy-makers have no choice other than viewing our youth as petitioners rather than potential apprentices.

3,3,The rising insecurity,"Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector.

There are several pointers to the jobs crisis in India: One, the number of workers in the age-group of 18-30 employed under the MGNREGA rose to 7.07 million in 2018-19, up from 5.8 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî signaling the lack of employment opportunities. Two, a study commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister says that even in the organised sector in India there was a preference in favour of ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs between 2011-12 and 2017-18. Thus, not only are enough employment opportunities not being created for the millions entering the labour market and for those shifting out of agriculture, but even the jobs that are being added are of the ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù kind, calling into question the quality of jobs created.

Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. But with the sector in the midst of a multi-year slowdown, employment opportunities are likely to have severely diminished. It is thus possible that the slowdown in economic activity, especially in the non-farm labour intensive sectors in both rural and urban areas, coupled with the terms of trade shifting against agriculture, would have pushed workers to seek employment under the employment guarantee scheme. The NSSO PLFS report also shows that youth unemployment (age group of 15 to 29) surged from 6.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 17.8 per cent in 2017-18, indicating that not enough employment opportunities exist. This slack in the labour market also reflects in the subdued wage growth. On the other hand, the jobs report indicates a shift towards informalisation of work relations even in the organised sector during this period. And as these ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs are unlikely to provide any form of social security benefits, it raises questions over the quality of these jobs.

The Mudra programme was meant to help tackle the jobs crisis in India. As reported in this paper, Rs 5.71 lakh crore was sanctioned during the first three years of this programme through 12.27 crore loan accounts. Yet, only 1.12 crore additional jobs were created during this period, implying that every new loan did not create an additional employment opportunity. This inability to create enough quality jobs will have long-term repercussions for the Indian economy. India is in the midst of a demographic transition, but the data so far suggests that it has not been able to take advantage of it.

Since he began his second term as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has talked of many things. Nationalism, Kashmir, citizenship, Pakistan, patriotism, treacherous Congress leaders. The one thing he seems to avoid talking about is the economy. Is this because he knows that the economy is in worse shape now than when he first became Prime Minister? Is this because as an astute politician he has noticed that much of the unrest we have seen on campuses across India is because India‚Äôs young people are beginning to feel a sense of hopelessness? A terrifying realisation that no matter how hard they work at their studies they could remain jobless for years?

Wherever I go these days I meet educated young Indians, many of whom voted for Modi, who admit that the thought of the future frightens them. They wear jeans, carry mobile phones and cut their hair in the latest fashion and almost the first thing they say to me is that they would be grateful if I could help them find a job. Not a government job. Just one that does not involve menial work. Even a street child I have helped with her education wants to be a fashion designer.

If for no other reason than that India faces an unemployment crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms last week. He tried his best to assure Modi and his ministers that he came bearing the gift of creating a million new jobs by 2025. Wearing an Indian waistcoat and radiating hope and goodwill, the world‚Äôs richest man declared that he was sure that the 21st century would be India‚Äôs century. But, instead of being welcomed, he was insulted publicly by Modi‚Äôs Minister of Commerce who told him that he did India no ‚Äúfavours‚Äù by offering to invest a billion dollars. ‚ÄúThey (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars, but then, if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,‚Äù said Piyush Goyal. If this was not rude enough, there was more to come. A senior BJP official intervened to tweet that Bezos order his newspaper, The Washington Post, to start writing nice things about the Modi government if he wanted to do business here.

The Prime Minister himself is so sensitive about the sullying of his image abroad by ‚Äòliberal‚Äô newspapers that he found no time to grant Bezos an audience. An odd decision if you consider that he travels to distant lands regularly to urge investors to come ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. Amazon is already, in its fashion, making in India. In rural India, Amazon has become almost a synonym for online shopping. Many of the unemployed youths I run into on my travels regularly go to it to buy everything from small household goods to books. Since in my own case I restrict my online shopping to books, I am constantly startled by the range of goods that young Indians are buying on Amazon. Insulting Bezos was in my view a mistake on the part of the Modi government.

Another mistake that the Prime Minister needs to pay much more attention to is his neglect of the economy in pursuit of political goals like abrogating Article 370 and passing that amendment to the citizenship law that has caused so much misgiving and mistrust. Both the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, have repeatedly urged Indian businessmen to invest without fear, but if this has not begun to happen, it is on account of misgiving and mistrust. The mission to ‚Äòeradicate‚Äô black money that began with demonetisation has given so much power to petty officials that they have all started to behave with the same obnoxious officiousness they displayed in bad old socialist times when the Licence Raj was alive and dominant. I live in Mumbai and can report that in recent months I have not met a single businessman, big or small, who has said that business was good.

What should worry the Prime Minister more is that most people blame him for what has gone wrong, whether it is businessmen, shopkeepers or jobless youth. In one voice they say that they voted for Modi not once but twice in the hope that he would concentrate on reviving the economy. When I ask if they are not pleased that such big political reforms as the abrogation of Article 370 have happened, they admit that they are not displeased. But that what they want more is for the economy to start showing signs of real recovery. It is in Modi‚Äôs hands to control the uncertainty that is caused by the endless new rules and regulations that his officials have come up with. But it is in the hands of men like Bezos to create the millions of jobs that young Indians desperately need.

5,5,The problem of skilling India,"The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar) The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent Independence Day speech, said, ‚ÄúWe need to worry about population explosion‚Äù. These words stand in stark contrast to his previous references to India‚Äôs demographic dividend where the country‚Äôs population was seen as an asset. This shift reflects a new awareness, according to which demography brings a dividend only if the youth is trained properly. Without proper training, instead of benefits, the country gets massive joblessness ‚Äî at least, this is what common sense suggests. Reality is more complicated.

A minimum of eight million new job seekers enter the jobs market every year. In 2017, only 5.5 million had been created, and the situation is worsening: Unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years today. The Indian youth has become the first casualty, with the unemployment rate reaching 34 per cent among the 20-24-year-olds in the first quarter of 2019 ‚Äî it was 37.9 per cent among the urban lot, according to the CMIE. Official sources from the government of India do not give very different data: According to the last 2018 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate among the urban 15-29-year-olds (a very large bracket) was 23.7 per cent. One may hypothesise that this pervasive joblessness was due to the poor training of the youth as only seven per cent of the people surveyed in the framework of the PLFS declared any formal or informal training.

But there is a paradox here: According to a recent survey, 48 per cent of Indian employers reported difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortage. The worst affected sector ‚Äî which is also one of the strong points of India‚Äôs economy ‚Äî has been Information Technology (IT), where 1,40,000 skilled techies could not be recruited in 2018 despite the employers‚Äô efforts (a high proportion of the 5,00,000 job offers that had been made that year). Indeed, the CMIE reports show that the more educated Indians are, the more likely they are to remain unemployed too. The last PLFS for 2018 revealed that 33 per cent of the formally trained 15-29-year-olds were jobless.

The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough. Hence, the ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù programme, whose objective was ‚Äúto train a minimum of 300 million skilled people by the year 2022‚Äù. In 2014, Modi created a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to harmonise training processes, assessments, certification and outcomes and, crucially, to develop Industrial Training Institutions (ITIs) ‚Äî the building blocks of this endeavour. The Executive Committee monitoring the mission gathered representatives of nine ministries, as vocational training was seen at the intersection of different domains, including agriculture, information technology, human resources development.

Modi, who chaired the governing council and announced the setting up of 1,500 new ITIs and 50,000 Skill Development Centres, committed himself to ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù in eloquent terms: ‚ÄúToday, the world and India need a skilled workforce. I also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this‚Äù.

Clearly, Modi saw ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù as a plan complementary to another flagship scheme he launched in 2014 ‚Äî ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù, a policy inviting foreign investors, and, as a way to train entrepreneurs (as evident from the name of the ministry in charge of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù).

Besides the creation of more courses and institutes of vocational training, the main innovation of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù consisted in integrating ‚Äúvocational training classes linked to the local economy‚Äù with formal education from class nine onwards in at least 25 per cent of the schools and higher education bodies. A very important aspect of Skill India was its PPP character: Companies were requested to ‚Äúearmark 2 per cent of their payroll bill (including for contract labour) for skill development initiatives‚Äù. In parallel, the ITIs were supposed to ‚Äútie up with industry in the relevant trades to improve placement opportunities for candidates‚Äù.

One of the most innovative dimensions of Skill India was the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana under which the training fees was paid by the government. The PMKVY‚Äôs budget was approximately Rs 12,000 crore for four years (2016-2020). Its main tool was the ‚Äúshort-term training‚Äù, which could last between 150 and 300 hours, and which included some placement assistance by Training Partners upon successful completion of their assessment by the candidates.

While the intentions of Skill India are commendable, the scheme falls short of the initial objectives. The target of this scheme was to reach out to 300 million young people by 2022, but only a mere 25 million had been trained under this scheme by the end of 2018. Partly due to mismanagement and partly due to the fact that funds available for ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù were either not spent sufficiently quickly ‚Äî because of a lack of candidates ‚Äî or too little was spent. The money problem is evident from the graph and from the PLF Survey mentioned above which showed that, in 2018, only 16 per cent of the youth who had received ‚Äúformal training were funded by the government‚Äù.

But the real problem lies elsewhere: Those who have been trained don‚Äôt find jobs. The number of those who have benefited from the Skill India scheme has increased, from 3,50,000 in 2016-17 to 1.6 million in 2017-18, but the percentage of those who could find a job upon completion of their training has dropped from more than 50 per cent to 30 per cent. If one focuses only on the PMKVY, the results are even more disappointing. Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha in March 2018, the then minister for skill development, Dharmendra Pradhan, told the House that in the framework of this programme 4.13 million people had been trained, but only 6,15,000 (15 per cent) of them got a job.

These limitations may be explained from three points of view.

First, the training was not good enough ‚Äì and this is why the employability rate remains very low. Second, while the government expected that some of the PMKVY-trainees would create their own enterprise, only 24 per cent of the 6,15,000 mentioned above started their business. And out of them, only 10,000 applied for MUDRA loans ‚Äîa drop in the ocean. Third, and more importantly, India‚Äôs joblessness issue is not only a skills problem, it is representative of the lack of appetite of industrialists and SMEs for recruiting. The decline of the investment rate is a clear indication that the demand is weak ‚Äîhence huge idle capacities ‚Äî and investing is not an easy thing to do anyway because of the limited access to credit that the accumulation of Non-Performing Assets has generated.

Skill India will not be enough to create jobs if the slowdown continues. But in the long run, Skill India will also not be enough if government expenditures in education remain low and if, therefore, the ground isn‚Äôt prepared for proper training. In fact, under the Modi government, allocation for school education has declined from 2.81 per cent of the budget in 2013-14 to 2.05 per cent in 2018-19. It was above 3 per cent during UPA II.

6,6,A problem of measurement,"We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar) We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar)

Modi 2.0 presents a new window of opportunity to usher in some fundamental reforms for the Indian economy. A modern dynamic economy requires a robust statistical system to provide precise and real time estimates of several critical indicators. One of these is unemployment ‚Äî which has been at the heart of prolonged acrimonious public debate in India for several years. Now is the time to move beyond the politics of unemployment to the real and pressing issue of measurement of unemployment. In 2016-17, the government of India, quite rightly so, was of the view that the existing frequency of measuring key unemployment and employment indicators was not adequate for the design of economic policies. There was a need for more timely and periodic measures ‚Äî a quarterly estimate in urban areas and an annual estimate in rural areas ‚Äî the ‚ÄúPeriodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)‚Äù. A committee of senior bureaucrats, economists and business leaders was constituted to look into this and an all-India PLFS survey was undertaken.

The results of this survey have not been officially released. However, the leaked reports of an historically high unemployment rate and the subsequent resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), who were involved with the PLFS, created a furore and heightened the politicisation of unemployment. The Opposition used this as an opportunity to malign the government, while the government representatives at NITI Aayog resorted to the view that the survey results have not been reviewed by experts, and therefore the report was not deemed reliable enough to be released. The truth of the matter, however, is that there is neither credible evidence of a job crisis in India, nor credible evidence of the absence of it. The problem requires a serious effort by the government to address issues of measurement. In this essay, I will outline what the government needs to do in this regard.

First, measurement of economic indicators, for example the unemployment rate, is an apolitical issue that requires statistical expertise of the highest standards. Before the release of any figure, it is imperative to discuss, debate and deliberate the methodological issues around the measurement. For example, to measure the unemployment rate, it is practically impossible to conduct a periodic census of all citizens above 15 years. Therefore, we have to rely on the second-best option of conducting sample surveys, and the natural question is then about the size of the sample survey. The sample size critically depends on the question of interest, for example, the sample size in the US is determined ‚Äúon the requirement that a difference of 0.2 percentage points in the unemployment rate for two consecutive months be statistically significant at the 0.10 level‚Äù. If the objective of the PLFS was to measure changes in unemployment from quarter-to-quarter in urban areas and year-to-year in rural areas, then we need to discuss sampling precisely to gauge these estimates. Therefore, there can be no credible discussion on changes in unemployment from one period to another in the absence of a paper that outlines in detail the underlying sampling methodology. Proprietary databases like the CMIE, which claim to estimate these time trends, have marketed themselves with a complete absence of such methodological requirements, and are hence non-credible.

Second, even if the sample size issue is addressed to minimise what statisticians call sampling errors (the sample size might not be large enough to address the question of interest), there are issues relating to non-sampling errors. This includes non-participation in the survey or refusal to answer some questions or misunderstanding of survey questions. Each of these are important issues and needs to be addressed in the methodology. For example, suppose there is a job boom in the economy and the employed overwhelmingly refuse to participate in such surveys or do not answer all questions, then it is possible for the survey to indicate high unemployment. Therefore, non-participation is an important issue and methodological rigour requires for a survey to have transparent strategies to prevent or minimise these errors.

Third, India is a large, complex and diverse economy that is undergoing structural transformation. Hence, we are moving towards precision policy-making which requires local and real time socio-economic indicators. We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. This requires local measures of unemployment so that economic policies can be tailored depending on local conditions. For instance, unemployment is a rural phenomenon in several states, while in others it is concentrated in urban areas. The state governments will have to participate along with the central government to have comparable uniform measures of periodic unemployment. This requires state governments to conduct periodic surveys on the same lines as the central government. Unfortunately, at present, several state governments do not have the capacity to conduct such regular surveys. This, however, is imperative for a large dynamic economy such as ours. Robust statistical systems will require that we begin to create such local capabilities urgently. It is time to move beyond one-size-fits-all solutions to more inclusive solutions that take into account local conditions.

In the end, one cannot help but recall eminent statistician John W Tukey‚Äôs words in 1949: ‚ÄúIt is far easier to put out a figure than to accompany it with a wise and reasoned account of its liability to systematic and fluctuating errors. Yet if the figure is to serve as the basis of an important decision, the accompanying account may be more important than the figure itself.‚Äù

To enhance India‚Äôs statistical capabilities, we have to move beyond the politics of it and focus on measuring with precision. Timely estimates are the cornerstones of policy-making in a modern dynamic and an aspirational economy like ours.

Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Dragged down by a contraction in manufacturing, weak investment, and lower consumption demand, India‚Äôs GDP growth rate at 4.5 per cent for Q2, 2019-20, hit a 26-quarter low in July-September, data released by National Statistical Office Friday showed.

This is the lowest quarterly growth rate in the five-and-half years of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The previous low was 4.3 per cent during January-March 2012-13.

READ | GDP growth at 4.5 per cent: Manmohan flags fear, India Inc‚Äôs silence on slowdown is telling

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), scheduled to announce its bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 5, is expected to continue its accommodative monetary policy stance with another repo rate cut to support growth.

Growth rate in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA), which is GDP minus net product taxes and reflects supply-side growth, has slowed to 4.3 per cent in July-September as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. With this, GDP growth rate for April-September, the first half of this fiscal, is now at 4.8 per cent as against 7.5 per cent growth in the year-ago period.

The growth rate has now slowed for the sixth consecutive quarter, declining by 3.6 percentage points during this period.

The nominal GDP growth rate, which accounts for inflation, slowed further from the first quarter to 6.1 per cent in July-September from double-digit level of 12 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Manufacturing growth contracted 1 per cent as against 6.9 per cent growth last year during the same quarter, while the ‚Äúagriculture, forestry and fishing‚Äù sector recorded a growth rate of 2.1 per cent as against 4.9 per cent last year. GVA growth for the construction sector also slowed to 3.3 per cent in July-September from 8.5 per cent year ago.

Most economists had expected GDP growth rate for the second quarter to slip to sub-5 per cent level with projections hovering in the 4.2-4.7 per cent range.

At 4.5 per cent, the GDP growth is much lower than 5.3 per cent projected for July-September by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its October policy. For the country to clock a growth rate of even 5 per cent for the full 2019-20 financial year, the economy would now have to grow at least 5.2 per cent in the remaining two quarters of this financial year.

Economists said without the support of higher government expenditure, GDP growth would have been even much lower, with most high frequency data such as non-food credit growth, auto sales and select fast-moving consumer goods already been indicating this slowdown.

‚ÄúAs it is becoming apparent that even festive demand has not been able to lift consumer sentiment and consumption demand, we believe 2HFY20 growth is also likely to be lacklustre resulting in an overall GDP growth of 5.6 per cent 2019-20. The low nominal growth rate of 6.1 per cent in the second quarter also does not augur well both for the government and the corporate sector as tax collection of the government and top line of corporate sector is linked to nominal GDP. However, given the current-growth inflation dynamics, we believe RBI will go for another 25bp rate cut in the forthcoming monetary policy review in December 2019,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings & Research.

With declining household savings and lower buoyancy in government‚Äôs revenue collections, there will be limited fiscal space to spur economic growth. The slowdown is also expected to adversely affect income growth which, in turn, would further dent consumption demand. A favourable low base effect, however, would be seen third quarter onwards, which may help push the headline growth number higher.

All eyes are now on the use of the monetary policy tool through more rate cuts, with most economists expecting RBI to cut repo rate by 25 basis points in the upcoming December policy meet. Experts also said sector-wise demand stimulus, especially focused on the non-banking financial sector, will be the need of the hour.

‚ÄúJust to depend on another rate cut by RBI in the upcoming MPC meeting may not be sufficient. The situation demands a coordinated fiscal priming in areas with higher multipliers and where spends could be immediately combined with a monetary policy push to address the effective transmission of rate cuts to NBFCs. The effect of rural demand uptick on Q3 numbers will be crucial to avert a sub-5 per cent annual growth rate,‚Äù said Ranen Banerjee, Leader Public Finance and Economics, PwC India.

8,8,Urban jobless rate hits 4-quarter low at 9.3 per cent,"A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March. A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Unemployment rate in urban areas moderated to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters, the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the January-March quarter showed. The urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, stood at 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.8 per cent in April-June 2018.

Female unemployment rate, however, was higher than the overall rate at 11.6 per cent in January-March, lower than 12.3 per cent in October -December 2018 and 12.8 per cent in April-June 2018, while unemployment rate for males stood at 8.7 per cent in January-March, as against 9.2 per cent in the previous quarter and 9 per cent in April-June 2018.

A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Among males of all ages, the highest unemployment rate was seen in Odisha at 15.6 per cent, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 13 per cent and Delhi at 12.9 per cent.

Labour-force estimate, according to current weekly status (CWS), is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of seven days preceding the date of survey.

Explained Some relief, annual PLFS report awaited Urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, has slowed to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters. Female unemployment rate improved, though it continued to stay above the overall unemployment rate, at 11.6 per cent in January-March from 12.3 per cent in the previous quarter. At a time when there is overall slowdown in the economy, these figures show marginal improvement. However, going ahead, the key dataset to watch out would be the yet-to-be released annual PLFS report, which would provide unemployment rate for rural and urban areas for 2018-19.

Comparable figures for the January-March quarter of 2018 are not available as the first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ended December 2018 was brought out in May this year. To be sure, this data set differs from the Annual Report of Periodic Labour Force Survey, which covers both rural and urban areas and gives estimates of employment and unemployment in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS.

The first annual PLFS report, which was first withheld and then released in May this year, was for July 2017- June 2018. The second annual PLFS report for July 2018-June 2019 is yet to be released.

As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above inched lower to 46.5 per cent in January-March from 46.8 per cent in the previous quarter.

Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also recorded a decline to 19.1 per cent in January-March from 19.5 per cent in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4 per cent in January-March from 73.6 per cent in October-December.

Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in January-March was recorded at 37.7 per cent, lower than 38.2 per cent for the previous quarter. Female LFPR for 15-29 years age group was at 16 per cent in January-March as against 16.7 per cent in the previous quarter, while for males, the LFPR moderated to 57.9 per cent in January-March from 58.3 per cent.

A state-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively.

The worker population ratio, which gives an estimate of the workforce in the current weekly status, remained broadly at the same level as the previous quarter at 32.7 per cent in January-March, the data showed.

9,9,Youth unemployment rising with educational qualifications: Study,"‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image) ‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image)

A key takeaway from the study of India‚Äôs unemployment trends by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati Parida (of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Central University of Punjab, respectively) is the fast-rising trend of youth unemployment.

By youth, the study refers to people in the age group of 15 to 29 years of age. The total number of unemployed youth went up marginally from 8.9 million in 2004-05 to 9 million in 2011-12 but, has since shot up to 25.1 million in 2017-18.

READ | Employment falls first time ‚Äî by 9 million in 6 years: Study

What is worse is that the rate of unemployment (in per cent) is higher as one goes up educational attainment (see chart). Moreover, the authors have concluded that youth unemployment has risen for all categories of educational attainment. The states that housed most of these 25 million unemployed youth include Uttar Pradesh (3 mn), Andhra Pradesh (2.2 mn), Tamil Nadu (2.2 mn), Maharashtra (1.9 mn), Bihar (1.9 mn), West Bengal (1.5 mn), Madhya Pradesh (1.3 mn), Karnataka (1.2 mn), Rajasthan (1.2 mn), Odisha (1.1 mn), Gujarat (1 mn) and Kerala (1 mn).

Mehrotra & Parida have based their conclusions on the National Sample Survey Organisation‚Äôs Employment-Unemployment Surveys for 2004-05 and 2011-12, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2017-18.

According to Mehrotra, while the total jobs in the agricultural sector have continued to decline massively from 232 million in 2011-12 to 205 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî and this is a desirable trend ‚Äî the rate of new job creation in the other sectors of the economy has not been enough to absorb the excess labour. As such, while jobs have gone up in the services sector (from 127 million to 144 million in 2017-18) and the non-manufacturing sector ‚Äî which includes activities such as construction, mining etc. ‚Äî from 55 million to 59 million, yet manufacturing, a sector which has the most capacity to soak up excess labour, saw total employment fall ‚Äî far from growing ‚Äî from 60 million to 56 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. A reflection of this is that the number of youth (between ages 15 and 29) declaring themselves as ‚ÄúNot in Labour Force, Education, or Training‚Äù rose to over 100 million in 2017-18 from 83 million in 2011-12. ‚ÄúThese are young people who are disheartened by the state of affairs and are neither looking for jobs, nor are they interested in studying or training themselves,‚Äù says Mehrotra.

The unemployment rate in India rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, the highest since September 2016, and up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, a Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report said. And, according to CMIE, nearly 11 million people lost jobs in 2018 after the demonetisation of high value notes in late 2016 and the chaotic launch of a new goods and services tax in 2017, hit millions of small businesses.

Communist Party of India (Marxist)

The age-old Communist Party of India (Marxist) is silent when it comes to education despite criticising the current system, and how RSS functionaries were appointed to high positions in universities and other higher institutions of learning. And neither does it address the current job scenario in India.

‚ÄúOur youth are frustrated due to the sharp fall in employment opportunities during the last few years. Modi had promised creation of 2 crore new jobs annually, i.e., 10 crores by now,‚Äù the manifesto reads.

The regional parties- Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Janata Dal, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), including others hardly highlight the issues of jobs and education in their manifesto.

11,11,"Youth felt lack of jobs, so new panel to focus on it: Gujarat Chief Secretary","He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime.

A day after the Union government set up a Cabinet committee on employment and skill development, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the panel as during the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections youth were feeling about lack of employment and of not being engaged in the processes of national growth and national development.

Speaking at the inauguration of the first two-day annual Student Start-up Innovation Policy (SSIP) conference in Gandhinagar, Singh said, ‚ÄúDuring the entire (Lok Sabha) election process, youth was feeling that there is a lack of employment, lack of overall opportunities to get engaged in the national growth and national development. These are the few things that this Cabinet sub-committee (on employment and skill development) will look into.‚Äù

Pitching for start-ups as new job creators, Singh talked about a ‚Äúbleak‚Äù job scenario a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù to what big industries can offer jobs as. ‚ÄúIf you look at the overall perspective of what is likely to happen, whether the youth are getting employed as many times, we do feel that there is a bleak picture. The type of people are coming up, we feel very proud of a solid democratic dividend which a country very rarely has. India is passing through that democratic dividend phase, but are we actually going to harness that democratic dividend? Are we really in a position to take care and get the fullest advantage of the youth that we are having,‚Äù the chief secretary asked.

He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. But there‚Äôs a limit to the job creation and that is where the start-ups come in, he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd as PM (Modi) keeps telling that the youth do not have to be job seekers but job givers. This is the what the youth of India and what the expectation from all of you is.‚Äù

Praising the entrepreneurship skills of Gujaratis, Singh said that the Gujarat government has been at the ‚Äúforefront of pioneering policies and institutions which have gone a long way in making an innovation culture at the grassroots level. ‚ÄúIn sync with various Central government schemes like Make In India, Start-Up India, Atal Innovation Mission, National Innovation Council, the Gujarat government has also taken very concrete steps to nurture, to support, to promote creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship,‚Äù he said.

The conference was organised the Education Department of the Government of Gujarat and was attended by Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, Principal Secretary (Education), Govt of Gujarat Anju Sharma and Commissioner of Technical Education Avantika Singh Aulakh.

12,12,Sena: Nehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of jobs,"This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre. This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

The Shiv Sena on Monday criticised ally BJP over rising unemployment, saying that the ‚ÄúNehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of 10 crore jobs that the BJP promised in 2014‚Äù.

This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

In the editorial, the Sena said it seemed that the new government had started working but many challenges lay ahead. ‚ÄúWhile there was a rise in the satta bazaars and share market after hearing that the Narendra Modi government was coming to power, the GDP growth rate decreased and the rate of unemployment increased. It is not a good sign. Rather than only discussing and advertising on how to tackle it, action is required,‚Äù said the editorial.

The editorial referred to the National Sample Survey Office report that showed a rise in unemployment of 6.1 per cent.

‚ÄúThe Union labour ministry has confirmed it. These are not our figures. The ruling party is claiming that the rise in unemployment is not our sin. Nitin Gadkari said the BJP has not created the unemployment issue in the last five years. We agree with his view but it has not achieved the target of generating two crore jobs per year and ten crore jobs in the last five years. The Nehru-Gandhi family cannot be blamed for it,‚Äù said the editorial.

13,13,"Gujarat: 80% youth jobless, BJP govt failed on job issue claims Congress","Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs

The Congress, which has been demanding resignation of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani since the cancellation of the police recruitment exam last Sunday following paper leak, on Saturday upped its attack, saying that as the head of the government he has failed to rein in growing unemployment in Gujarat.

Quoting figures released by the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Federation of Industries Association, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that 80 per cent youth are unemployed in the state.

‚ÄúYouth look up to the government jobs because industries have become sick and are unable to provide employment to qualified youths. For 9,000 government jobs, a whopping 9.12 lakh people applied,‚Äù Modhwadia said, referring to the number of candidates who had applied for the police recruitment exam that was cancelled last Sunday.

The party also accused the BJP government of crony capitalism, saying ‚Äúrelatives of big industrialists were being facilitated under the disguise of helping the MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), but the government is turning away genuinely needy entrepreneurs‚Äù.

Modhwadia also said that ‚Äúthanks to anti-industry policies of the BJP government, half of industries are shut and others are on the verge of closure‚Äù. ‚ÄúOut of 202 GIDC estates, only 102 are working, only two industrial estate were set up in the past 15 years of the BJP rule in Gujarat. Not only this, there has been a 10 per cent decline in finance to industries in the past seven months,‚Äù the former Congress Legislature Party leader said.

He said that in Surat textile units, 8.80 lakh people have been rendered jobless due to 40 production loss in looms. He also demanded charging of interest on idle industrial plots.

14,14,Economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government after operation J&K,"The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand) The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand)

The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the symbol of the seat of power of the government. Within a one-kilometre radius are Parliament, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, and North Block and South Block that house the key ministries of Home, Finance, Defence and External Affairs. The Prime Minister‚Äôs official residence is also within the radius of one kilometre as are the homes of the Vice-President, the Speaker, the three Defence Chiefs and most members of Parliament.

Multiple Conversations

What is the conversation in this power circle? It is about the dismembering of Jammu & Kashmir, the passage of controversial Bills in both Houses of Parliament, the capitulation of regional ruling parties, the dominance of Mr Narendra Modi, the laboured resolution of the issue of the leadership of the Congress party, and the sad passing of Sushma Swaraj. It is about everything except the economy.

Beginning barely 50 kilometres away in all directions from the centre, in practically every village and every poor urban neighbourhood, the conversation is radically different: it is mainly about the economy ‚Äî the decline or stagnation in real wages and real incomes, the lay-offs and retrenchments, the search in vain for jobs, the death and devastation caused by flood or drought, the crippling shortage of water and electricity, and the fight for survival in an unequal and harsh world.

About 1,150 kilometres away in Mumbai, the city that is home to the RBI, SEBI, the stock exchanges and corporate headquarters of many listed companies and banks, the conversation is about only one thing ‚Äî money, or the lack of it. It is about the steep decline in the BSE and NSE indices, the depreciation of the rupee, the rising yield on bonds, the mounting losses in public sector banks, the stiff taxes (and the heavy-handed enforcement), the pull-out by FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) and the suicide by V G Siddhartha, promoter of Cafe Coffee Day.

An Uncaring Government

In my view, a caring government will pay the highest attention to the conversation among the working people and the poor. The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. Unfortunately, the economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government which is barely able to conceal the triumphalism after Operation J&K.

Here is a snapshot of the economy:

1. GDP growth rate continues to decline. After 6.8% for the whole year and 5.8% in the last quarter of 2018-19, the first quarter of 2019-20 doesn‚Äôt seem too promising. RBI and others have lowered the forecast for the whole year 2019-20 to 6.9%; hence we will be lucky if the first quarter produces another 5.8%.

2. Core sector growth has dropped to a 50-month low of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation in all manufacturing segments is, on average, below 70%.

3. The rupee is now Asia‚Äôs worst-performing currency. It has fallen 3.4% against the US dollar in August.

4. Investment in new projects (private and government) announced in the quarter ending June 2019 declined to a 15-year low of Rs 71,337 crore. The value of projects completed in the quarter fell to a five-year low of Rs 69,494 crore. Revenue earning in rail freight (that comes from carrying coal, cement, petroleum, fertiliser, iron ore, etc) grew by 2.7% in April-June 2019, down from 6.4% in the same period last year.

5. In April-July 2019, exports (merchandise and services) grew by 3.13% over the same period last year while imports declined 0.45%, pointing to depressed economic activity.

6. Consumption is down as never before. In Q1 of 2019-20, car sales were down 23.3%, two-wheeler sales were down 11.7%, commercial vehicle sales were down 9.5% and tractor sales were down 14.1%. July was worse. Industry associations (SIAM and FADA) have reported that 2,30,000 jobs have been lost and 286 dealerships have been shut. In the construction industry, 12,80,000 units remained unsold at the end of March 2019.

7. Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) was no better. Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, among others, have reported volume growth rate in April-June 2019 that is one half or less than the volume growth rate in the same period last year.

8. WPI in July stood at 1.08%. Within the index, the manufacturing sector inflation stood at 0.34%. These are not good signs, they are signs of low demand.

9. Gross tax revenue of the Central government grew by 1.4% in Q1 of 2019-20 as against 22.1% in the same period last year. What this tells us is that incomes are lower for corporates and individuals and spending is less.

Where is the Plan?

We go back to the mantra of four drivers of growth: government expenditure, private investment, private consumption and exports. Evidently, none of the engines is revving up and driving growth. This has been said so many times and by so many people (including acknowledged economists), but the government is unwilling to hear or understand or act. The economy is one area where muscular nationalism will not work. On the contrary, it may work to the detriment of the economy.
