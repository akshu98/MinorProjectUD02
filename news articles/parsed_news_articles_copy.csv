"Comprehensive employment, industrial policies are necessary to address jobs crisis","since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image) since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image)

A report in this paper (IE, November 1) on various employment estimates for 2017-18, based on the PLFS (periodic labour force survey) data, has received considerable attention. We have received several queries from policy makers regarding the differences in our employment estimates with studies by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey (BD), and Himanshu that are quoted in the report. In this article, we clarify the reasons for the differences and highlight the major findings of our study.

First, our estimates are different from that of BD because theirs are based only on the usual principal status (UPS) of employment. Our study is based on both usual principal and subsidiary status (UPSS) of employment. Since Himanshu‚Äôs estimates are also based on UPSS, our figures are not much different except for the 2017-18 PLFS figures. Himanshu‚Äôs and our estimates for employment in both 2004-05 and 2011-12 are almost the same (the negligible difference is because of the use of population multipliers that differ at second and third decimal points). The discrepancy with Himanshu‚Äôs 2017-18 employment figure is only because he probably used a lower population multiplier based on a projected total population of 1.33 billion.

But, while comparing Himanshu‚Äôs estimates with that of BD for 2017-18, we find that both their figures are the same (this is surprising since BD have ignored the subsidiary status of employment unlike Himanshu). We have explored why this has happened. BD have used a projected population of close to 1.36 billion based on their argument that the annual population growth of India was about 1.7 per cent between 2011-12 and 2017-18. This is a very high overestimation of India‚Äôs population growth rate during this period. The World Bank‚Äôs population projection (available at World Development Indicators) shows that annual population growth in India was only 1.2 per cent per annum in 2012 and 1.04 per cent in 2018, and the total population was about 1.34 billion in 2017-18. Our population projections (based on a monthly exponential growth rate) show that the total population in India was about 1.345 billion in 2017-18 (the same as the World Bank‚Äôs estimate).

The National Family Health Survey 2015-16 shows that there has been a phenomenal decline in the total fertility rate (the number of children born to women in the reproductive age group of 15-49), reaching a near replacement rate of 2.2 per woman, from 2.7 in 2005-06. Hence, the 1.06 per cent population growth rate we use is logical; and 1.7 per cent cannot be India‚Äôs current population growth rate. The use of the latter artificially raises the workforce number that BD came up with, 457 million in 2017-18. This is surprising since they had missed out on subsidiary workers altogether. Hence, they fail to find that the total jobs in India fell by nine million in six years, a first in India‚Äôs history.

Moreover, since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. The principal employment status is recorded for a relatively longer duration of time in the survey year (normally for a period of six months and more). It leaves out those who work for less than six months, and who must also be counted among those working. The subsidiary status of employment data (covering those working 30 days but less than 182 days), covers those not employed in the principal status, and must be added to workers in principal status. So, by ignoring the subsidiary employment, BD provide an incomplete and incorrect employment trend for India.

Hence, BD‚Äôs claim that manufacturing employment during 2011-12 and 2017-18 was ‚Äústagnant‚Äù is also misleading. In fact, based on the UPSS, we found that manufacturing employment actually declined by three million between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. While labour intensive sub-sectors were mainly responsible for this decline, a few capital intensive manufacturing sub-sectors did register consistent growth of jobs during 2004-05 and 2017-2018. Although the quality of jobs is very poor in the services sector, it has played a major role in driving job growth, but only partly offsetting the fall in employment in agriculture, manufacturing, and slowing employment creation in the construction sector. In fact, because of their problematic methodology, BD fail to notice the actual fall in total employment (including self-employment of the Ola/Uber or Mudra variety, which is captured in a comprehensive sample of the unorganised and organised sector workers).

The share of regular and formal employment increased marginally due to growth of formal jobs in the private sector, but the share of informal jobs (without social security) within the government/public sector has increased. A dominant and rising share of jobs is still generated by micro and small units in the unorganised sectors without any formal or written job contract. In both government and private sectors, the number of contract jobs (with no written contract, or less than a year‚Äôs contract, or one to three-years contract) is on the rise post 2011-12. Although BD‚Äôs paper also reveals the same story, we differ from them on the absolute number of jobs. The rate of growth of jobs in the unorganised component is much higher than in the organised sector (those with more than 10 workers).

Moreover, BD‚Äôs research also provides a partial picture of the unemployment trends in India as they could not capture the upsurge in open unemployment among educated youth (which has more than doubled in a matter of six years), nor the recent rise in the disheartened youth labour force (those in the age group of 15-29 and not in educational institutions or the labour force). We found that the number of disheartened youth (having secondary and above level of general education, and with technical and vocational qualifications) is rising at an alarming rate.

With total jobs falling at a time when new entrants into the labour force are increasing at an accelerating pace, it is not surprising that real wages have not increased in both rural and urban areas. From now on, entrants into the labour force will increase at an accelerating pace, at least until 2030. Hence, a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy (to boost growth of medium and large firms) is necessary to address the transformation of agrarian workforce, boost real wages, and to ensure industrial development.

Explained: Is the push towards organised manufacturing the answer to India‚Äôs jobs crisis?,"For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector. For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

In any Budget, there are essentially two main questions that need to be answered. One, what is the outlook on boosting economic growth. Two, what is the status of the fiscal health of the government ‚Äî that is, what is the level of fiscal deficit etc.

This year, however, there is another big question: What can the government do to boost employment in the country.

In the past year, there have been several reports, both official and by independent academics, that have painted a bleak picture on the jobs front. For instance, a 2017-18 National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) survey pegged unemployment at a 45-year high. Other researchers like Mehrotra & Parida as well as Himanshu have shown how the absolute number of ‚Äúemployed‚Äù people witnessed a decline between 2012 and 2018.

For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

Why manufacturing?

It has been argued that between the three broad sectors of the economy ‚Äî agriculture, industry and services ‚Äî it is the industry sector, and within industry, the manufacturing sector that has the highest potential to absorb the surplus labour in the economy.

Agriculture, which engages almost half the Indian workforce, does not grow fast enough and is, as such, not remunerative enough to provide gainful employment to the millions who join India‚Äôs workforce each year. It is for this reason why more and more people have left agriculture and tried to join other sectors of the economy since 2004.

Services is a fast-growing sector and pays well but it places far greater demands on job seekers in terms of skills and education. Often, the rural millions looking for a job find themselves inadequate in terms of delivering in the services sector ‚Äî not without skills education at least.

That leaves the industry, which includes sub-sectors like manufacturing and non-manufacturing (that is, construction and mining etc.). Research shows that the employment elasticity ‚Äî the ability to create new jobs with every additional increase in a sector‚Äôs growth ‚Äî of the manufacturing sector is the highest.

Explaining the Budget, Part-1: How the Union Budget is prepared

What did the past governments do?

For a while now, both UPA and NDA governments have tried to focus on boosting the growth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, in 2011, Congress-led UPA came out with a new National Manufacturing Policy that aimed at raising the share of the manufacturing sector to 25% of the GDP by 2022. The BJP-led NDA too unveiled the Make in India initiative that focussed using manufacturing as the main platform to create jobs.

Each Union Budget tends to focus on measures that will promote manufacturing ‚Äî both big- and small-scale ‚Äî and create jobs.

However, despite such a focussed stand right through the past decade, manufacturing‚Äôs share is still under 17% of the GDP and the jobs situation in the country has only got worse.

What does the data show?

An analysis of the Indian manufacturing sector done by India Ratings shows that manufacturing units in the organised sector are becoming more capital intensive ‚Äî that is the capital-to-labour ratio is increasing. In other words, instead of increasing the number of workers in a unit, owners are choosing to increase the amount of capital.

As Table 1 shows, the trend is of a secular increase over the years. What is worse is that this trend holds true across the board including those sectors such as textiles and leather products that are considered ‚Äúlabour-intensive‚Äù and most capable of creating jobs and soaking up surplus labour (see Tables 2 and 3).

The oddest bit in this trend is that owners of these manufacturing units appear to be increasingly substituting labour with capital even when the return on capital is falling. Data shows that in the organised manufacturing sector profit per unit of capital invested has fallen sharply between 2007-08 and 2017-18.

The flip side of this picture is the decline in India‚Äôs labour productivity growth rate ‚Äî see Table 4

Not surprisingly, this trend of falling labour productivity growth in organised manufacturing has also gone along with a decline in wage growth ‚Äî Table 5

Yet again, this trend of decline in wage growth is largely secular across the board and includes sectors like textiles and leather that could create the maximum jobs.

Explaining the Budget, Part-2: What ails the credibility of India‚Äôs Budget numbers

What is the upshot?

The data shows that in organised manufacturing ‚Äî that is, manufacturing done in the formal sector where workers are covered under labour laws etc. ‚Äî labour productivity growth and wages growth are declining and businesses are increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital.

This raises several questions for policymakers:

1> Why are manufacturing owners increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital? It is important to note that they continue to do so even when the return on capital is falling.

2> If this is the trend, how reasonable is it to assume that boosting manufacturing growth will create more jobs for the Indian youth?

3> The government has been increasingly pushing for ‚Äúorganised‚Äù or formal sector manufacturing but if this trend is anything to go by, is such a push justified?

4> What is the extent to which the lack of significant labour reform is holding back manufacturing from achieving its potential to create jobs?

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stands up to present the Budget on February 1, these are some of the issues she could be expected to address when discussing the growing question mark on unemployment in India.

It‚Äôs a wage crisis,"At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.

The debate around unemployment is unhelpful ‚Äî since 1947, unemployment has bounced between 3-7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force. But reconciling this mathematical accuracy with our painful poverty ‚Äî it has bounced between 25-75 per cent of our population since 1947, based on your definition of needs, wants and desires ‚Äî needs an understanding of the ‚Äúself-exploitation‚Äù theory proposed by the Russian economist Alexander Chayanov in the 1920s. He convinced Jawaharlal Nehru that small farms are viable because you don‚Äôt have to pay yourself rent or pay a salary to yourself, spouse or kids. I make the case that one, self-exploitation ‚Äî hanging out vella (idle) with low or zero marginal productivity in farms, self-employment or subsistence wage employment ‚Äî has been India‚Äôs labour market shock absorber since 1947. Two, this shock absorber no longer works because Indians born after 1991 expect a living wage (that meets aspirations) rather than a minimum wage (that keeps mind and body together). And three, these higher wage expectations can only be met by transitioning people to higher productivity sectors, geographies, and firms.

Our current debate confuses jobs with wages. Almost every Indian who wants a job has a job but they don‚Äôt get the wages they want or need because they work in unviable sectors (48 per cent of our labour force on farms generates only 13 per cent of the GDP), unviable firms (our 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 19,500 companies with a paid-up capital greater than Rs 10 crore), unviable entrepreneurship (50 per cent of our labour force is not self-employed but self-exploiting), and unviable geographies (2 lakh of our 6 lakh villages have less than 200 people).

Historian Ramachandra Guha reminds us that India may not yet be the most important or powerful country in the world but it is surely the most interesting. Our political parties have created the world‚Äôs largest democracy on the infertile soil of the world‚Äôs most hierarchical society. But we had zero chances of creating the world‚Äôs largest economy on the infertile soil of the economic model articulated by the Avadi Resolution of 1955 and the Second Five Year plan of 1956. High wages need a complex ecosystem of high productivity firms and individuals: IT firms employ only 0.7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force but produce 7 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP. A waiter in Chicago with skills similar to a waiter in Jaipur makes 20 times higher wages because of the productivity of the customers eating at the restaurant, and India‚Äôs 20 million manufacturing SME‚Äôs have at least 25 times lower productivity than Germany‚Äôs 200,000 mittelstand (SMEs).

Essentially, the GDP of 114 million Maharashtrians is more than 204 million people in Uttar Pradesh because Maharashtra is more formalised, industrialised, financialised, urbanised and skilled. Similarly, the GDP of 1.2 billion Indians till 2019 was lower than 66 million Britons because socialism ‚Äî capitalism without competition and bankruptcy ‚Äî led to nutty economics after 1947. Three books ‚Äî Capitalism in America; A History by Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap by Yuen Yuen Ang, and Lost Glory; India‚Äôs Capitalism Story by Sumit Majumdar ‚Äî talk about choices and consequences. America amplified prosperity (35 per cent of people in official poverty have air-conditioning and 60 per cent have a car), China has used markets to move 700 million people out of poverty since 1978, while our licence-raj bred inefficiency. Politician Vasant Sathe pointed out in the 1980s that India‚Äôs public sector steel industry employed 10 times more people to produce half the steel of South Koreans.

But India is breaking with its past. We have six million new registered enterprises after GST and 30 million new social security payers in three years. Our new monetary policy committee and fiscal discipline have blunted inflation from 8.33 per cent in 2014 to 2.19 per cent. Our new bankruptcy law has started recycling assets of Rs 14 lakh crore. In the 1960s, the-then RBI governor L K Jha had presciently warned that resource utilisation is as important as resource mobilisation. Digital payments have exploded from 0.1 million the month before demonetisation to 650 million last month. Infrastructure spending has doubled in the last five years accompanied by qualitative improvements in air connectivity, ports, highways and railways. Finally, a modern state is a welfare state with a broad tax base; India has more than a crore new individual tax filers since demonetisation with a 45 per cent increase in returns with incomes below Rs 10 lakh last year.

For India‚Äôs 25th birthday in 1972, the late Sheila Dhar wrote a wonderful book, This India that suggested, ‚ÄúIndians have great patience. It is not in their nature to be in a hurry. They can wait longer, suffer more and work harder than other people.‚Äù This paragraph would probably change for the 75th birthday version in 2022; the impatience of our young is changing India and her politics. And thankfully, our democracy means that the Chinese communist party strategy articulated in the 1980s ‚Äî fill their stomachs but empty their minds ‚Äî will not work in India. India‚Äôs youth don‚Äôt aspire to replace self-exploitation with the patronising pessimism of loan-write offs, subsidies or income without work; they recognise that a hard day‚Äôs work in a formal job provides dignity, strength, identity and purpose in addition to living wages.

At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. In 1910, Tagore articulated this vision in ‚ÄòChitto Jetha Bhoyshunno‚Äô hoping his country would awake to a freedom where tireless striving stretches its arms to perfection. The end of our acceptance of self-exploitation embodies a freedom that would please the great sentinel. India‚Äôs challenge is not jobs but employed poverty and while there is much unfinished work, it‚Äôs delusional to believe we aren‚Äôt making good progress. And it is unhelpful presentism to believe that policy-makers have no choice other than viewing our youth as petitioners rather than potential apprentices.

The rising insecurity,"Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector.

There are several pointers to the jobs crisis in India: One, the number of workers in the age-group of 18-30 employed under the MGNREGA rose to 7.07 million in 2018-19, up from 5.8 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî signaling the lack of employment opportunities. Two, a study commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister says that even in the organised sector in India there was a preference in favour of ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs between 2011-12 and 2017-18. Thus, not only are enough employment opportunities not being created for the millions entering the labour market and for those shifting out of agriculture, but even the jobs that are being added are of the ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù kind, calling into question the quality of jobs created.

Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. But with the sector in the midst of a multi-year slowdown, employment opportunities are likely to have severely diminished. It is thus possible that the slowdown in economic activity, especially in the non-farm labour intensive sectors in both rural and urban areas, coupled with the terms of trade shifting against agriculture, would have pushed workers to seek employment under the employment guarantee scheme. The NSSO PLFS report also shows that youth unemployment (age group of 15 to 29) surged from 6.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 17.8 per cent in 2017-18, indicating that not enough employment opportunities exist. This slack in the labour market also reflects in the subdued wage growth. On the other hand, the jobs report indicates a shift towards informalisation of work relations even in the organised sector during this period. And as these ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs are unlikely to provide any form of social security benefits, it raises questions over the quality of these jobs.

The Mudra programme was meant to help tackle the jobs crisis in India. As reported in this paper, Rs 5.71 lakh crore was sanctioned during the first three years of this programme through 12.27 crore loan accounts. Yet, only 1.12 crore additional jobs were created during this period, implying that every new loan did not create an additional employment opportunity. This inability to create enough quality jobs will have long-term repercussions for the Indian economy. India is in the midst of a demographic transition, but the data so far suggests that it has not been able to take advantage of it.

"With India facing a job crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms","Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File) Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File)

Since he began his second term as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has talked of many things. Nationalism, Kashmir, citizenship, Pakistan, patriotism, treacherous Congress leaders. The one thing he seems to avoid talking about is the economy. Is this because he knows that the economy is in worse shape now than when he first became Prime Minister? Is this because as an astute politician he has noticed that much of the unrest we have seen on campuses across India is because India‚Äôs young people are beginning to feel a sense of hopelessness? A terrifying realisation that no matter how hard they work at their studies they could remain jobless for years?

Wherever I go these days I meet educated young Indians, many of whom voted for Modi, who admit that the thought of the future frightens them. They wear jeans, carry mobile phones and cut their hair in the latest fashion and almost the first thing they say to me is that they would be grateful if I could help them find a job. Not a government job. Just one that does not involve menial work. Even a street child I have helped with her education wants to be a fashion designer.

If for no other reason than that India faces an unemployment crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms last week. He tried his best to assure Modi and his ministers that he came bearing the gift of creating a million new jobs by 2025. Wearing an Indian waistcoat and radiating hope and goodwill, the world‚Äôs richest man declared that he was sure that the 21st century would be India‚Äôs century. But, instead of being welcomed, he was insulted publicly by Modi‚Äôs Minister of Commerce who told him that he did India no ‚Äúfavours‚Äù by offering to invest a billion dollars. ‚ÄúThey (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars, but then, if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,‚Äù said Piyush Goyal. If this was not rude enough, there was more to come. A senior BJP official intervened to tweet that Bezos order his newspaper, The Washington Post, to start writing nice things about the Modi government if he wanted to do business here.

The Prime Minister himself is so sensitive about the sullying of his image abroad by ‚Äòliberal‚Äô newspapers that he found no time to grant Bezos an audience. An odd decision if you consider that he travels to distant lands regularly to urge investors to come ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. Amazon is already, in its fashion, making in India. In rural India, Amazon has become almost a synonym for online shopping. Many of the unemployed youths I run into on my travels regularly go to it to buy everything from small household goods to books. Since in my own case I restrict my online shopping to books, I am constantly startled by the range of goods that young Indians are buying on Amazon. Insulting Bezos was in my view a mistake on the part of the Modi government.

Another mistake that the Prime Minister needs to pay much more attention to is his neglect of the economy in pursuit of political goals like abrogating Article 370 and passing that amendment to the citizenship law that has caused so much misgiving and mistrust. Both the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, have repeatedly urged Indian businessmen to invest without fear, but if this has not begun to happen, it is on account of misgiving and mistrust. The mission to ‚Äòeradicate‚Äô black money that began with demonetisation has given so much power to petty officials that they have all started to behave with the same obnoxious officiousness they displayed in bad old socialist times when the Licence Raj was alive and dominant. I live in Mumbai and can report that in recent months I have not met a single businessman, big or small, who has said that business was good.

What should worry the Prime Minister more is that most people blame him for what has gone wrong, whether it is businessmen, shopkeepers or jobless youth. In one voice they say that they voted for Modi not once but twice in the hope that he would concentrate on reviving the economy. When I ask if they are not pleased that such big political reforms as the abrogation of Article 370 have happened, they admit that they are not displeased. But that what they want more is for the economy to start showing signs of real recovery. It is in Modi‚Äôs hands to control the uncertainty that is caused by the endless new rules and regulations that his officials have come up with. But it is in the hands of men like Bezos to create the millions of jobs that young Indians desperately need.

The problem of skilling India,"The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar) The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent Independence Day speech, said, ‚ÄúWe need to worry about population explosion‚Äù. These words stand in stark contrast to his previous references to India‚Äôs demographic dividend where the country‚Äôs population was seen as an asset. This shift reflects a new awareness, according to which demography brings a dividend only if the youth is trained properly. Without proper training, instead of benefits, the country gets massive joblessness ‚Äî at least, this is what common sense suggests. Reality is more complicated.

A minimum of eight million new job seekers enter the jobs market every year. In 2017, only 5.5 million had been created, and the situation is worsening: Unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years today. The Indian youth has become the first casualty, with the unemployment rate reaching 34 per cent among the 20-24-year-olds in the first quarter of 2019 ‚Äî it was 37.9 per cent among the urban lot, according to the CMIE. Official sources from the government of India do not give very different data: According to the last 2018 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate among the urban 15-29-year-olds (a very large bracket) was 23.7 per cent. One may hypothesise that this pervasive joblessness was due to the poor training of the youth as only seven per cent of the people surveyed in the framework of the PLFS declared any formal or informal training.

But there is a paradox here: According to a recent survey, 48 per cent of Indian employers reported difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortage. The worst affected sector ‚Äî which is also one of the strong points of India‚Äôs economy ‚Äî has been Information Technology (IT), where 1,40,000 skilled techies could not be recruited in 2018 despite the employers‚Äô efforts (a high proportion of the 5,00,000 job offers that had been made that year). Indeed, the CMIE reports show that the more educated Indians are, the more likely they are to remain unemployed too. The last PLFS for 2018 revealed that 33 per cent of the formally trained 15-29-year-olds were jobless.

The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough. Hence, the ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù programme, whose objective was ‚Äúto train a minimum of 300 million skilled people by the year 2022‚Äù. In 2014, Modi created a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to harmonise training processes, assessments, certification and outcomes and, crucially, to develop Industrial Training Institutions (ITIs) ‚Äî the building blocks of this endeavour. The Executive Committee monitoring the mission gathered representatives of nine ministries, as vocational training was seen at the intersection of different domains, including agriculture, information technology, human resources development.

Modi, who chaired the governing council and announced the setting up of 1,500 new ITIs and 50,000 Skill Development Centres, committed himself to ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù in eloquent terms: ‚ÄúToday, the world and India need a skilled workforce. I also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this‚Äù.

Clearly, Modi saw ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù as a plan complementary to another flagship scheme he launched in 2014 ‚Äî ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù, a policy inviting foreign investors, and, as a way to train entrepreneurs (as evident from the name of the ministry in charge of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù).

Besides the creation of more courses and institutes of vocational training, the main innovation of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù consisted in integrating ‚Äúvocational training classes linked to the local economy‚Äù with formal education from class nine onwards in at least 25 per cent of the schools and higher education bodies. A very important aspect of Skill India was its PPP character: Companies were requested to ‚Äúearmark 2 per cent of their payroll bill (including for contract labour) for skill development initiatives‚Äù. In parallel, the ITIs were supposed to ‚Äútie up with industry in the relevant trades to improve placement opportunities for candidates‚Äù.

One of the most innovative dimensions of Skill India was the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana under which the training fees was paid by the government. The PMKVY‚Äôs budget was approximately Rs 12,000 crore for four years (2016-2020). Its main tool was the ‚Äúshort-term training‚Äù, which could last between 150 and 300 hours, and which included some placement assistance by Training Partners upon successful completion of their assessment by the candidates.

While the intentions of Skill India are commendable, the scheme falls short of the initial objectives. The target of this scheme was to reach out to 300 million young people by 2022, but only a mere 25 million had been trained under this scheme by the end of 2018. Partly due to mismanagement and partly due to the fact that funds available for ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù were either not spent sufficiently quickly ‚Äî because of a lack of candidates ‚Äî or too little was spent. The money problem is evident from the graph and from the PLF Survey mentioned above which showed that, in 2018, only 16 per cent of the youth who had received ‚Äúformal training were funded by the government‚Äù.

But the real problem lies elsewhere: Those who have been trained don‚Äôt find jobs. The number of those who have benefited from the Skill India scheme has increased, from 3,50,000 in 2016-17 to 1.6 million in 2017-18, but the percentage of those who could find a job upon completion of their training has dropped from more than 50 per cent to 30 per cent. If one focuses only on the PMKVY, the results are even more disappointing. Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha in March 2018, the then minister for skill development, Dharmendra Pradhan, told the House that in the framework of this programme 4.13 million people had been trained, but only 6,15,000 (15 per cent) of them got a job.

These limitations may be explained from three points of view.

First, the training was not good enough ‚Äì and this is why the employability rate remains very low. Second, while the government expected that some of the PMKVY-trainees would create their own enterprise, only 24 per cent of the 6,15,000 mentioned above started their business. And out of them, only 10,000 applied for MUDRA loans ‚Äîa drop in the ocean. Third, and more importantly, India‚Äôs joblessness issue is not only a skills problem, it is representative of the lack of appetite of industrialists and SMEs for recruiting. The decline of the investment rate is a clear indication that the demand is weak ‚Äîhence huge idle capacities ‚Äî and investing is not an easy thing to do anyway because of the limited access to credit that the accumulation of Non-Performing Assets has generated.

Skill India will not be enough to create jobs if the slowdown continues. But in the long run, Skill India will also not be enough if government expenditures in education remain low and if, therefore, the ground isn‚Äôt prepared for proper training. In fact, under the Modi government, allocation for school education has declined from 2.81 per cent of the budget in 2013-14 to 2.05 per cent in 2018-19. It was above 3 per cent during UPA II.

A problem of measurement,"We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar) We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar)

Modi 2.0 presents a new window of opportunity to usher in some fundamental reforms for the Indian economy. A modern dynamic economy requires a robust statistical system to provide precise and real time estimates of several critical indicators. One of these is unemployment ‚Äî which has been at the heart of prolonged acrimonious public debate in India for several years. Now is the time to move beyond the politics of unemployment to the real and pressing issue of measurement of unemployment. In 2016-17, the government of India, quite rightly so, was of the view that the existing frequency of measuring key unemployment and employment indicators was not adequate for the design of economic policies. There was a need for more timely and periodic measures ‚Äî a quarterly estimate in urban areas and an annual estimate in rural areas ‚Äî the ‚ÄúPeriodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)‚Äù. A committee of senior bureaucrats, economists and business leaders was constituted to look into this and an all-India PLFS survey was undertaken.

The results of this survey have not been officially released. However, the leaked reports of an historically high unemployment rate and the subsequent resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), who were involved with the PLFS, created a furore and heightened the politicisation of unemployment. The Opposition used this as an opportunity to malign the government, while the government representatives at NITI Aayog resorted to the view that the survey results have not been reviewed by experts, and therefore the report was not deemed reliable enough to be released. The truth of the matter, however, is that there is neither credible evidence of a job crisis in India, nor credible evidence of the absence of it. The problem requires a serious effort by the government to address issues of measurement. In this essay, I will outline what the government needs to do in this regard.

First, measurement of economic indicators, for example the unemployment rate, is an apolitical issue that requires statistical expertise of the highest standards. Before the release of any figure, it is imperative to discuss, debate and deliberate the methodological issues around the measurement. For example, to measure the unemployment rate, it is practically impossible to conduct a periodic census of all citizens above 15 years. Therefore, we have to rely on the second-best option of conducting sample surveys, and the natural question is then about the size of the sample survey. The sample size critically depends on the question of interest, for example, the sample size in the US is determined ‚Äúon the requirement that a difference of 0.2 percentage points in the unemployment rate for two consecutive months be statistically significant at the 0.10 level‚Äù. If the objective of the PLFS was to measure changes in unemployment from quarter-to-quarter in urban areas and year-to-year in rural areas, then we need to discuss sampling precisely to gauge these estimates. Therefore, there can be no credible discussion on changes in unemployment from one period to another in the absence of a paper that outlines in detail the underlying sampling methodology. Proprietary databases like the CMIE, which claim to estimate these time trends, have marketed themselves with a complete absence of such methodological requirements, and are hence non-credible.

Second, even if the sample size issue is addressed to minimise what statisticians call sampling errors (the sample size might not be large enough to address the question of interest), there are issues relating to non-sampling errors. This includes non-participation in the survey or refusal to answer some questions or misunderstanding of survey questions. Each of these are important issues and needs to be addressed in the methodology. For example, suppose there is a job boom in the economy and the employed overwhelmingly refuse to participate in such surveys or do not answer all questions, then it is possible for the survey to indicate high unemployment. Therefore, non-participation is an important issue and methodological rigour requires for a survey to have transparent strategies to prevent or minimise these errors.

Third, India is a large, complex and diverse economy that is undergoing structural transformation. Hence, we are moving towards precision policy-making which requires local and real time socio-economic indicators. We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. This requires local measures of unemployment so that economic policies can be tailored depending on local conditions. For instance, unemployment is a rural phenomenon in several states, while in others it is concentrated in urban areas. The state governments will have to participate along with the central government to have comparable uniform measures of periodic unemployment. This requires state governments to conduct periodic surveys on the same lines as the central government. Unfortunately, at present, several state governments do not have the capacity to conduct such regular surveys. This, however, is imperative for a large dynamic economy such as ours. Robust statistical systems will require that we begin to create such local capabilities urgently. It is time to move beyond one-size-fits-all solutions to more inclusive solutions that take into account local conditions.

In the end, one cannot help but recall eminent statistician John W Tukey‚Äôs words in 1949: ‚ÄúIt is far easier to put out a figure than to accompany it with a wise and reasoned account of its liability to systematic and fluctuating errors. Yet if the figure is to serve as the basis of an important decision, the accompanying account may be more important than the figure itself.‚Äù

To enhance India‚Äôs statistical capabilities, we have to move beyond the politics of it and focus on measuring with precision. Timely estimates are the cornerstones of policy-making in a modern dynamic and an aspirational economy like ours.

"Six-year low ‚Äî and slow: GDP growth recorded at 4.5 per cent, lowest in more than 6 years","Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed. Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Dragged down by a contraction in manufacturing, weak investment, and lower consumption demand, India‚Äôs GDP growth rate at 4.5 per cent for Q2, 2019-20, hit a 26-quarter low in July-September, data released by National Statistical Office Friday showed.

This is the lowest quarterly growth rate in the five-and-half years of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The previous low was 4.3 per cent during January-March 2012-13.

READ | GDP growth at 4.5 per cent: Manmohan flags fear, India Inc‚Äôs silence on slowdown is telling

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), scheduled to announce its bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 5, is expected to continue its accommodative monetary policy stance with another repo rate cut to support growth.

Growth rate in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA), which is GDP minus net product taxes and reflects supply-side growth, has slowed to 4.3 per cent in July-September as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. With this, GDP growth rate for April-September, the first half of this fiscal, is now at 4.8 per cent as against 7.5 per cent growth in the year-ago period.

The growth rate has now slowed for the sixth consecutive quarter, declining by 3.6 percentage points during this period.

The nominal GDP growth rate, which accounts for inflation, slowed further from the first quarter to 6.1 per cent in July-September from double-digit level of 12 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Manufacturing growth contracted 1 per cent as against 6.9 per cent growth last year during the same quarter, while the ‚Äúagriculture, forestry and fishing‚Äù sector recorded a growth rate of 2.1 per cent as against 4.9 per cent last year. GVA growth for the construction sector also slowed to 3.3 per cent in July-September from 8.5 per cent year ago.

Most economists had expected GDP growth rate for the second quarter to slip to sub-5 per cent level with projections hovering in the 4.2-4.7 per cent range.

At 4.5 per cent, the GDP growth is much lower than 5.3 per cent projected for July-September by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its October policy. For the country to clock a growth rate of even 5 per cent for the full 2019-20 financial year, the economy would now have to grow at least 5.2 per cent in the remaining two quarters of this financial year.

Economists said without the support of higher government expenditure, GDP growth would have been even much lower, with most high frequency data such as non-food credit growth, auto sales and select fast-moving consumer goods already been indicating this slowdown.

‚ÄúAs it is becoming apparent that even festive demand has not been able to lift consumer sentiment and consumption demand, we believe 2HFY20 growth is also likely to be lacklustre resulting in an overall GDP growth of 5.6 per cent 2019-20. The low nominal growth rate of 6.1 per cent in the second quarter also does not augur well both for the government and the corporate sector as tax collection of the government and top line of corporate sector is linked to nominal GDP. However, given the current-growth inflation dynamics, we believe RBI will go for another 25bp rate cut in the forthcoming monetary policy review in December 2019,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings & Research.

With declining household savings and lower buoyancy in government‚Äôs revenue collections, there will be limited fiscal space to spur economic growth. The slowdown is also expected to adversely affect income growth which, in turn, would further dent consumption demand. A favourable low base effect, however, would be seen third quarter onwards, which may help push the headline growth number higher.

All eyes are now on the use of the monetary policy tool through more rate cuts, with most economists expecting RBI to cut repo rate by 25 basis points in the upcoming December policy meet. Experts also said sector-wise demand stimulus, especially focused on the non-banking financial sector, will be the need of the hour.

‚ÄúJust to depend on another rate cut by RBI in the upcoming MPC meeting may not be sufficient. The situation demands a coordinated fiscal priming in areas with higher multipliers and where spends could be immediately combined with a monetary policy push to address the effective transmission of rate cuts to NBFCs. The effect of rural demand uptick on Q3 numbers will be crucial to avert a sub-5 per cent annual growth rate,‚Äù said Ranen Banerjee, Leader Public Finance and Economics, PwC India.

Urban jobless rate hits 4-quarter low at 9.3 per cent,"A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March. A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Unemployment rate in urban areas moderated to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters, the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the January-March quarter showed. The urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, stood at 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.8 per cent in April-June 2018.

Female unemployment rate, however, was higher than the overall rate at 11.6 per cent in January-March, lower than 12.3 per cent in October -December 2018 and 12.8 per cent in April-June 2018, while unemployment rate for males stood at 8.7 per cent in January-March, as against 9.2 per cent in the previous quarter and 9 per cent in April-June 2018.

A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Among males of all ages, the highest unemployment rate was seen in Odisha at 15.6 per cent, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 13 per cent and Delhi at 12.9 per cent.

Labour-force estimate, according to current weekly status (CWS), is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of seven days preceding the date of survey.

Explained Some relief, annual PLFS report awaited Urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, has slowed to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters. Female unemployment rate improved, though it continued to stay above the overall unemployment rate, at 11.6 per cent in January-March from 12.3 per cent in the previous quarter. At a time when there is overall slowdown in the economy, these figures show marginal improvement. However, going ahead, the key dataset to watch out would be the yet-to-be released annual PLFS report, which would provide unemployment rate for rural and urban areas for 2018-19.

Comparable figures for the January-March quarter of 2018 are not available as the first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ended December 2018 was brought out in May this year. To be sure, this data set differs from the Annual Report of Periodic Labour Force Survey, which covers both rural and urban areas and gives estimates of employment and unemployment in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS.

The first annual PLFS report, which was first withheld and then released in May this year, was for July 2017- June 2018. The second annual PLFS report for July 2018-June 2019 is yet to be released.

As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above inched lower to 46.5 per cent in January-March from 46.8 per cent in the previous quarter.

Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also recorded a decline to 19.1 per cent in January-March from 19.5 per cent in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4 per cent in January-March from 73.6 per cent in October-December.

Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in January-March was recorded at 37.7 per cent, lower than 38.2 per cent for the previous quarter. Female LFPR for 15-29 years age group was at 16 per cent in January-March as against 16.7 per cent in the previous quarter, while for males, the LFPR moderated to 57.9 per cent in January-March from 58.3 per cent.

A state-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively.

The worker population ratio, which gives an estimate of the workforce in the current weekly status, remained broadly at the same level as the previous quarter at 32.7 per cent in January-March, the data showed.

Youth unemployment rising with educational qualifications: Study,"‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image) ‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image)

A key takeaway from the study of India‚Äôs unemployment trends by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati Parida (of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Central University of Punjab, respectively) is the fast-rising trend of youth unemployment.

By youth, the study refers to people in the age group of 15 to 29 years of age. The total number of unemployed youth went up marginally from 8.9 million in 2004-05 to 9 million in 2011-12 but, has since shot up to 25.1 million in 2017-18.

READ | Employment falls first time ‚Äî by 9 million in 6 years: Study

What is worse is that the rate of unemployment (in per cent) is higher as one goes up educational attainment (see chart). Moreover, the authors have concluded that youth unemployment has risen for all categories of educational attainment. The states that housed most of these 25 million unemployed youth include Uttar Pradesh (3 mn), Andhra Pradesh (2.2 mn), Tamil Nadu (2.2 mn), Maharashtra (1.9 mn), Bihar (1.9 mn), West Bengal (1.5 mn), Madhya Pradesh (1.3 mn), Karnataka (1.2 mn), Rajasthan (1.2 mn), Odisha (1.1 mn), Gujarat (1 mn) and Kerala (1 mn).

Mehrotra & Parida have based their conclusions on the National Sample Survey Organisation‚Äôs Employment-Unemployment Surveys for 2004-05 and 2011-12, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2017-18.

According to Mehrotra, while the total jobs in the agricultural sector have continued to decline massively from 232 million in 2011-12 to 205 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî and this is a desirable trend ‚Äî the rate of new job creation in the other sectors of the economy has not been enough to absorb the excess labour. As such, while jobs have gone up in the services sector (from 127 million to 144 million in 2017-18) and the non-manufacturing sector ‚Äî which includes activities such as construction, mining etc. ‚Äî from 55 million to 59 million, yet manufacturing, a sector which has the most capacity to soak up excess labour, saw total employment fall ‚Äî far from growing ‚Äî from 60 million to 56 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. A reflection of this is that the number of youth (between ages 15 and 29) declaring themselves as ‚ÄúNot in Labour Force, Education, or Training‚Äù rose to over 100 million in 2017-18 from 83 million in 2011-12. ‚ÄúThese are young people who are disheartened by the state of affairs and are neither looking for jobs, nor are they interested in studying or training themselves,‚Äù says Mehrotra.

"Youth felt lack of jobs, so new panel to focus on it: Gujarat Chief Secretary","He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime.

A day after the Union government set up a Cabinet committee on employment and skill development, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the panel as during the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections youth were feeling about lack of employment and of not being engaged in the processes of national growth and national development.

Speaking at the inauguration of the first two-day annual Student Start-up Innovation Policy (SSIP) conference in Gandhinagar, Singh said, ‚ÄúDuring the entire (Lok Sabha) election process, youth was feeling that there is a lack of employment, lack of overall opportunities to get engaged in the national growth and national development. These are the few things that this Cabinet sub-committee (on employment and skill development) will look into.‚Äù

Pitching for start-ups as new job creators, Singh talked about a ‚Äúbleak‚Äù job scenario a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù to what big industries can offer jobs as. ‚ÄúIf you look at the overall perspective of what is likely to happen, whether the youth are getting employed as many times, we do feel that there is a bleak picture. The type of people are coming up, we feel very proud of a solid democratic dividend which a country very rarely has. India is passing through that democratic dividend phase, but are we actually going to harness that democratic dividend? Are we really in a position to take care and get the fullest advantage of the youth that we are having,‚Äù the chief secretary asked.

He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. But there‚Äôs a limit to the job creation and that is where the start-ups come in, he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd as PM (Modi) keeps telling that the youth do not have to be job seekers but job givers. This is the what the youth of India and what the expectation from all of you is.‚Äù

Praising the entrepreneurship skills of Gujaratis, Singh said that the Gujarat government has been at the ‚Äúforefront of pioneering policies and institutions which have gone a long way in making an innovation culture at the grassroots level. ‚ÄúIn sync with various Central government schemes like Make In India, Start-Up India, Atal Innovation Mission, National Innovation Council, the Gujarat government has also taken very concrete steps to nurture, to support, to promote creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship,‚Äù he said.

The conference was organised the Education Department of the Government of Gujarat and was attended by Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, Principal Secretary (Education), Govt of Gujarat Anju Sharma and Commissioner of Technical Education Avantika Singh Aulakh.

Sena: Nehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of jobs,"This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre. This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

The Shiv Sena on Monday criticised ally BJP over rising unemployment, saying that the ‚ÄúNehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of 10 crore jobs that the BJP promised in 2014‚Äù.

This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

In the editorial, the Sena said it seemed that the new government had started working but many challenges lay ahead. ‚ÄúWhile there was a rise in the satta bazaars and share market after hearing that the Narendra Modi government was coming to power, the GDP growth rate decreased and the rate of unemployment increased. It is not a good sign. Rather than only discussing and advertising on how to tackle it, action is required,‚Äù said the editorial.

The editorial referred to the National Sample Survey Office report that showed a rise in unemployment of 6.1 per cent.

‚ÄúThe Union labour ministry has confirmed it. These are not our figures. The ruling party is claiming that the rise in unemployment is not our sin. Nitin Gadkari said the BJP has not created the unemployment issue in the last five years. We agree with his view but it has not achieved the target of generating two crore jobs per year and ten crore jobs in the last five years. The Nehru-Gandhi family cannot be blamed for it,‚Äù said the editorial.

"Gujarat: 80% youth jobless, BJP govt failed on job issue claims Congress","Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs

The Congress, which has been demanding resignation of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani since the cancellation of the police recruitment exam last Sunday following paper leak, on Saturday upped its attack, saying that as the head of the government he has failed to rein in growing unemployment in Gujarat.

Quoting figures released by the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Federation of Industries Association, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that 80 per cent youth are unemployed in the state.

‚ÄúYouth look up to the government jobs because industries have become sick and are unable to provide employment to qualified youths. For 9,000 government jobs, a whopping 9.12 lakh people applied,‚Äù Modhwadia said, referring to the number of candidates who had applied for the police recruitment exam that was cancelled last Sunday.

Arjun Modhwadia Arjun Modhwadia

The party also accused the BJP government of crony capitalism, saying ‚Äúrelatives of big industrialists were being facilitated under the disguise of helping the MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), but the government is turning away genuinely needy entrepreneurs‚Äù.

Modhwadia also said that ‚Äúthanks to anti-industry policies of the BJP government, half of industries are shut and others are on the verge of closure‚Äù. ‚ÄúOut of 202 GIDC estates, only 102 are working, only two industrial estate were set up in the past 15 years of the BJP rule in Gujarat. Not only this, there has been a 10 per cent decline in finance to industries in the past seven months,‚Äù the former Congress Legislature Party leader said.

He said that in Surat textile units, 8.80 lakh people have been rendered jobless due to 40 production loss in looms. He also demanded charging of interest on idle industrial plots.

Economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government after operation J&K,"The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand) The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand)

The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the symbol of the seat of power of the government. Within a one-kilometre radius are Parliament, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, and North Block and South Block that house the key ministries of Home, Finance, Defence and External Affairs. The Prime Minister‚Äôs official residence is also within the radius of one kilometre as are the homes of the Vice-President, the Speaker, the three Defence Chiefs and most members of Parliament.

Multiple Conversations

What is the conversation in this power circle? It is about the dismembering of Jammu & Kashmir, the passage of controversial Bills in both Houses of Parliament, the capitulation of regional ruling parties, the dominance of Mr Narendra Modi, the laboured resolution of the issue of the leadership of the Congress party, and the sad passing of Sushma Swaraj. It is about everything except the economy.

Beginning barely 50 kilometres away in all directions from the centre, in practically every village and every poor urban neighbourhood, the conversation is radically different: it is mainly about the economy ‚Äî the decline or stagnation in real wages and real incomes, the lay-offs and retrenchments, the search in vain for jobs, the death and devastation caused by flood or drought, the crippling shortage of water and electricity, and the fight for survival in an unequal and harsh world.

About 1,150 kilometres away in Mumbai, the city that is home to the RBI, SEBI, the stock exchanges and corporate headquarters of many listed companies and banks, the conversation is about only one thing ‚Äî money, or the lack of it. It is about the steep decline in the BSE and NSE indices, the depreciation of the rupee, the rising yield on bonds, the mounting losses in public sector banks, the stiff taxes (and the heavy-handed enforcement), the pull-out by FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) and the suicide by V G Siddhartha, promoter of Cafe Coffee Day.

An Uncaring Government

In my view, a caring government will pay the highest attention to the conversation among the working people and the poor. The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. Unfortunately, the economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government which is barely able to conceal the triumphalism after Operation J&K.

Here is a snapshot of the economy:

1. GDP growth rate continues to decline. After 6.8% for the whole year and 5.8% in the last quarter of 2018-19, the first quarter of 2019-20 doesn‚Äôt seem too promising. RBI and others have lowered the forecast for the whole year 2019-20 to 6.9%; hence we will be lucky if the first quarter produces another 5.8%.

2. Core sector growth has dropped to a 50-month low of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation in all manufacturing segments is, on average, below 70%.

3. The rupee is now Asia‚Äôs worst-performing currency. It has fallen 3.4% against the US dollar in August.

4. Investment in new projects (private and government) announced in the quarter ending June 2019 declined to a 15-year low of Rs 71,337 crore. The value of projects completed in the quarter fell to a five-year low of Rs 69,494 crore. Revenue earning in rail freight (that comes from carrying coal, cement, petroleum, fertiliser, iron ore, etc) grew by 2.7% in April-June 2019, down from 6.4% in the same period last year.

5. In April-July 2019, exports (merchandise and services) grew by 3.13% over the same period last year while imports declined 0.45%, pointing to depressed economic activity.

6. Consumption is down as never before. In Q1 of 2019-20, car sales were down 23.3%, two-wheeler sales were down 11.7%, commercial vehicle sales were down 9.5% and tractor sales were down 14.1%. July was worse. Industry associations (SIAM and FADA) have reported that 2,30,000 jobs have been lost and 286 dealerships have been shut. In the construction industry, 12,80,000 units remained unsold at the end of March 2019.

7. Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) was no better. Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, among others, have reported volume growth rate in April-June 2019 that is one half or less than the volume growth rate in the same period last year.

8. WPI in July stood at 1.08%. Within the index, the manufacturing sector inflation stood at 0.34%. These are not good signs, they are signs of low demand.

9. Gross tax revenue of the Central government grew by 1.4% in Q1 of 2019-20 as against 22.1% in the same period last year. What this tells us is that incomes are lower for corporates and individuals and spending is less.

Where is the Plan?

We go back to the mantra of four drivers of growth: government expenditure, private investment, private consumption and exports. Evidently, none of the engines is revving up and driving growth. This has been said so many times and by so many people (including acknowledged economists), but the government is unwilling to hear or understand or act. The economy is one area where muscular nationalism will not work. On the contrary, it may work to the detriment of the economy.

"National male workforce shrinking, says labour report that Govt buried","The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image) The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image)

For the first time since 1993-94, the actual size of India‚Äôs male workforce, or men who are working, has shrunk. Data from the NSSO‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey 2017-18, reviewed by The Indian Express, account for 28.6 crore employed male in the country. This is the first instance of a drop in the male workforce that steadily swelled from 21.9 crore in 1993-94 to 30.4 crore in 2011-12 when the last NSSO survey was conducted. This suggests fewer men were employed in 2017-18 compared with five years ago.

The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (see chart). The slide is steeper ‚Äî 6.4% ‚Äî in the rural areas compared to a 4.7% setback observed in the urban sector. The yet -to-be-released PLFS report put the unemployment rate for male in urban and rural segments at 7.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively.

Experts, who did not wish to be named, said the data requires deeper study, but clearly points to job losses, and fewer fresh employment opportunities.

The NSSO report, based on the PLFS conducted between July 2017 and June 2018, is yet to be released by the government. The Acting Chairperson of the National Statistical Commission P C Mohanan and another member, J V Meenakshi, quit January-end this year after the government withheld the release of the report that was approved by the commission in December 2018.

The NSSO data shows an employment loss of 4.3 crore (from 30.9 crore in 2011-12 to 26.6 crore in 2017-18) in the rural and 0.4 crore (from 11.1 crore in 2011-12 to 10.7 crore in 2017-18) in the urban segment. While the employment loss in the rural segment hurt the women most (68 per cent), men suffered more (96 per cent) job losses in the urban areas. In all, since 2011-12, India‚Äôs national workforce shrunk by 4.7 crore ‚Äî more than the population of Saudi Arabia.

Economists call for raising voice against suppression of data

Read | Even Mudra job survey data put in deep freeze

While the NSSO publishes employment rates in percentage ‚Äî and not actual workforce figures ‚Äî its data sets include details of populations, sex ratio, labour force participation rates, employment-to-population ratio etc. Overall, the PLFS 2017-18 reported a 6.1 per cent unemployment rate, a sharp jump from 2.2 per cent reported in 2011-12.

Explained Why this should be a worry A shrinking workforce suggests an increase in the number of unemployed, and also points to fewer new job opportunities. Given India‚Äôs demography and labour force growth over the decades, this should be a cause for concern.

Like the 2017-18 NSSO survey, the 2011-12 survey also recorded a major loss of employment in rural women which was largely offset by a reasonable jump in employment in rural male. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, women in rural employment shrunk by 22 million. In the same period, male in rural employment increased by 13 million. This resulted in a net rural employment loss of 90 lakh in that period (see Table 2). But the growth reversal in male employment since 2011-12 resulted in over four and half times that loss in national employment.

According to PLFS 2017-18, the percentage of working age (15-59 years) population that received any formal vocational/technical training actually came down from 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 to 2 per cent in 2017-18. Among the youth (15-29 years), however, a jump of 0.1 per cent is recorded in the same time period.

One crore jobs in last year: Here is how PM Modi built his case during speech in Lok Sabha,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)

Rejecting criticism that the government failed to create enough jobs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said over one crore jobs were created in the country over the past one year. The PM, during no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha on Friday, mentioned the survey figures by an independent institute. To lend weight to his argument, he referred to employment figures available in the system including EPF, NPS, formal and informal sector. He talked about job growth and employment towards the end of his speech.

READ | No-confidence motion: How PM Modi and Rahul Gandhi pitched their lines for 2019

The PM said that many lies are being spread over the issue of unemployment in the country. ‚ÄúAgain, there is an attempt to trample the truth. There is no information but the opposition is just making baseless talks. Had they thoroughly looked into the matter (unemployment), they would not have committed the sin of playing politics by dashing the hopes of youths of the country,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced the government‚Äôs decision to publish job data every month. ‚ÄúThe government will present before the country all figures regarding employment present in the system, every month.‚Äù

This is how he tracked the employment and job growth in the last one year:

Employment in Formal sector- EPF, NPS data, Doctors, CAs, Lawyers

* ‚ÄúThere is a way to assess employment in the formal sector- through Employee Provident Fund (EPF),‚Äù he said, adding that in the nine months between September 2017 and May 2018, 45 lakh new subscribers had joined the EPFO, out of which 77 per cent were less than 28 years of age.

* The National Pension Scheme had attracted 5.68 lakh new subscribers during the same period. ‚ÄúTaking the EPF and NPS subscribers together, more than 50 lakh jobs were created in nine months,‚Äù he said, adding that this figure would reach 70 lakh for the whole year. PM Modi said data from the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIC) was not taken into account as Aadhar linking of subscribers was still underway.

* ‚ÄúBesides this, there are a number of professional bodies in the country from where young professionals register themselves and become self-independent. For example, doctors, engineers, architects, chartered accountants, company secretaries. According to the survey by an independent institute, 17,000 new Chartered Accountants have joined in the system. Of them, 5,000 have started new companies. If one Chartered Accountant institute provides employment to 20 people, then around 1 lakh CA‚Äôs must have got employment in such institutes.

* ‚ÄúIn our country, more than 80,000 postgraduate doctors, dental surgeons, and AYUSH doctors pass out of colleges every year. Of them, even if 60 per cent starts their own practice, then one doctor can provide employment to 5 other people, and this figure will be 2,40,000.

* In 2017, there were around 80,000 new undergraduate and postgraduate lawyers. Out of them, even if 60 per cent may have started their practice and provided employment to 2-3 people, then around 2 lakh new jobs are expected.

* ‚ÄúIn these three professions only (doctors, CAs and lawyers), more than 6 lakh people have got employment opportunity in 2017,‚Äù PM Modi said.

Informal sector: Transport sector including the sale of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and auto-rickshaws

* ‚ÄúNow if we talk about informal sector, then many people get employment in the transport sector. Last year, 7,60,000 commercial vehicles were sold. Even if we suppose that 25 per cent of this was a replacement of old vehicles, 5.7 lakh new vehicles were pressed into service for transporting goods. If one commercial vehicle has two people working on it, nearly 11.40 lakh jobs were created in this sector,‚Äù he said.

* If we see passenger vehicles, then this sale figure was 25,40,000. Out of that, if 25 per cent was a replacement of old vehicles, then 20 lakh new vehicles were on the roads. Even if 25 per cent of these new vehicles get a driver and conductor, then 5 lakh new jobs were created.

* Last year, 2, 55,000 autos were sold. Out of them, even if 10 per cent was a replacement of old autos, then around 2,30,000 autos were pressed into service last year. Since autos work in two shifts, three people get employed by 2 autos. In this way, 3,40,000 people got employment through new autos.

* In the transport sector alone, these three categories of vehicles have proved job opportunities to 20 lakh people, the PM said. ‚ÄúIf we combine all these figures from EPF, NPS, professions and transport sector, then around 1 crore new jobs were created in the last one year alone. This is conveyed through the survey of an independent institute. I am quoting that institute and not citing government data. Therefore, it is my request to not bury the truth without knowing the facts. There should be no effort to mislead the country in this regard,‚Äù the prime minister said in the Lok Sabha.

"Across the aisle: Governments hide, people seek","It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

How much can you hide behind one number? A lot, if the media played ball.

On the day after the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the growth numbers for 2017-18, the media played up just one number: 7.7 per cent. At first blush it appeared to be the GDP growth number for the whole year 2017-18, and was certainly impressive. Actually, it was the growth number for just one quarter, Q4, and the uptick was also because of the low base effect. For the whole year, however, the GDP growth rate was a sobering 6.7 per cent.

The government puffed up the Q4 growth rate and claimed that the worst effects of demonetisation and a flawed GST were over. Mercifully, the government stopped short of making the claim that achhe din had arrived. At the end of four years, the government has switched over to a modest Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas (Clean intention, right progress)!

The path of the BJP-led NDA government‚Äôs four-year journey is littered with too many broken promises: Rs 15 lakh in every bank account, 2 crore jobs, MSP at cost + 50 per cent, waiver of agricultural loans, insurance cover to all farmers, peace and security in Jammu and Kashmir, a good and simple GST, and many more. You can add to the list from your own experience.

Look at Outcomes

At the end of four of the five years allowed to a government, the people cannot be expected to judge a government by its intent. The correct test is outcomes. Look at the boxes with the graphs. Every line depicts a measurable parameter. And every line, after showing promise in the first year, has dipped.

Some conclusions can be drawn without fear of contradiction. Beginning 2012-13, the economy was on the mend, and the GDP growth rate accelerated from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 6.4 per cent in 2013-14 to 7.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 8.2 per cent in 2016-17. The story thereafter is one of steep decline. From 8.2 per cent to 6.7 per cent in two years, it is a fall of 1.5 per cent ‚Äî exactly what I had predicted after demonetisation.

Miserable Story

Other lines in the two boxes also tell the miserable story:

Credit growth dipped drastically from 13.8 per cent to 5.4 per cent before recovering somewhat in 2017-18. Within credit growth, it is credit to industry that is important. In the last four years, annual credit growth rates to industry were 5.6, 2.7, -1.9 and 0.7 per cent.

The index of industrial production (IIP) has remained flat. That number demolishes the claims on behalf of the much-touted Make in India programme. Besides, as far as defence production is concerned, the Make in India model was officially abandoned a few days ago (see Business Standard, June 6, 2018).

Gross NPAs have risen from Rs 2,63,015 crore to Rs 10,30,000 crore and will rise more. The banking system is practically bankrupt. I have not come across a banker who will willingly sanction a loan; nor an investor who will confidently borrow money. The economy is running on just one wheel ‚Äî government expenditure.

Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), after falling from 31.3 per cent in 2013-14 to 28.5 per cent in 2015-16, is stuck at the same level for three years, proving my point that private investment is in the doldrums.

Merchandise exports hit a peak of USD 315 billion in 2013-14. Since then, the figure has struggled to cross USD 300 billion and, in two out of the four years, it was well below the peak.

Mood of Despondency

We could pick up more economic indicators and draw the lines on a graph. It will be the same story of poor analysis and reckless decisions (demonetisation, flawed GST, stagnant farm wages, high fuel prices, intimidating tax recovery, mala fide investigations etc).

The mood of the nation is despondent. In the RBI‚Äôs survey (May 2018), 48 per cent of respondents felt that the economic situation had worsened in the last one year. In some sectors, like agriculture, despondency has turned into anger. Among some sections of the people, like Dalits and unemployed youth, despondency has turned into despair.

It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

"Congress to focus on agriculture, employment to challenge BJP","‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently.

Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said (Representational Image)

Ahead of polls in some states and the 2019 general elections, the Congress has decided to up the ante over issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty as it prepares to take on the ruling BJP, party sources said. For The Grand Old Party‚Äôs plenary session, to be held between March 16 and March 18 in the national capital, a separate resolution will be passed on issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty alleviation. During the last plenary session in 2010, agrarian and employment issues were part of the economic resolution.

The Congress has also formed a nine-member sub-group on ‚Äòagriculture, employment and poverty alleviation‚Äô under the chairmanship of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Party leader Meenakshi Natarajan is the convener of the sub-group.

‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said, requesting anonymity. This, however, is not the first time that the party will have a separate resolution on agrarian and employment-related issues. The leader added that the Congress had passed a similar resolution in 2001.

‚ÄúWe had taken enough measures to see these problems do not surface when we were in power (till 2014). The situation was better when we had the last plenary session,‚Äù the leader claimed. Another party insider said the issues of employment and poverty alleviation have become ‚Äúacute‚Äù over the past three years.

‚ÄúThe economy has been paralysed due to the government‚Äôs double blow of demonetisation and GST. We will have to reach out to the people on the issues,‚Äù the insider added. The leader said that the party has already started reaching out to the youth and first-time voters on issues concerning them, including that of employment.

Modi Government Does Not Acknowledge the Word 'Slowdown': Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: In a sharp attack on the Narendra Modi government over the state of the economy, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said the current dispensation does not acknowledge the word ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù, and the real danger is that if problems are not recognised, then finding credible answers to take corrective action is unlikely.

Addressing a gathering at the launch of Montek Singh Ahluwalia‚Äôs book Backstage: The Story behind India‚Äôs High Growth Years, Singh cited the former planning commission‚Äôs observations to state that achieving the target of $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù.

Singh said the former planning commission deputy chairman has written about the good as well as the weak points of the UPA government.

‚ÄúI think these issues will be debated and should be debated because we have today a government that does not acknowledge that there is such a word as slowdown. I think this is not good for our country,‚Äù the former prime minister said.

‚ÄúIf you do not recognise the problems that you face, you are not likely to find credible answers to take corrective action. That is the real danger,‚Äù he said, attacking the government on the state of the economy.

The book will be of great help to the future growth of the country, Singh said.

‚ÄúMontek has also pointed out that contrary to what the ruling group may say, today the $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking. Also there is no reason to expect that farmers‚Äô income will be doubled in a three- year period,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAt the same time, he (Ahluwalia) said we must work for high rate of growth and that 8% growth rate is a feasible proposition but it requires rethinking about the role of fiscal policy. There is a need for tax reforms in the country in a bolder way,‚Äù Singh said.

He also hailed the role played by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, P. Chidambaram and Ahluwalia for supporting his liberalisation of the economy in the 1990s and enabling him as the then finance minister to carry out the reforms despite resistance from different quarters.

Later, during a panel discussion at the book launch, former finance minister Chidambaram said former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs remarks that the Indian economy headed for intensive care unit, were ‚Äúnearly correct‚Äù.

‚ÄúI disagree in the following manner ‚Äì the patient (economy) is being wheeled into the ICU, the patient is being stopped just outside the ICU and is being looked at by incompetent doctors,‚Äù Chidambaram said in a dig at the government.

‚ÄúThere is no aggregate demand rise, unemployment is rising, consumption is falling‚Ä¶ Yet the government says all is well, which means we have to rewrite our textbooks of economics. Every indicator is pointing southward. If every indicator is pointing southward, how can the GDP rise to 7 or 8%,‚Äù he said.

Asked about his advice to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Chidambaram said, ‚ÄúPlease resign.‚Äù

Participating in the panel discussion with Chidambaram, Ahluwalia, and former RBI governor Y. Venugopal Reddy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister Bibek Debroy said there is a slowdown but if ‚Äúyou try to neatly pin that slowdown to something that happened in 2019 that is debatable‚Äù.

In his address, Manmohan Singh hoped that there will be consensus among right-thinking persons about the path that Ahluwalia had identified for dealing with the economic situation in the country.

Referring to the UPA years, he said, ‚ÄúThere will be question marks, there should be question marks and I hope there will be solid debate that will produce a better programme for carrying out the reform process further.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe that there is need for re-thinking of the reform process fresh. Second generation of reforms requires new pathways and these new pathways can emerge only with solid discussion of the alternatives,‚Äù he said.

Singh, who was the finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government rolled out the liberalisation policy, talked in detail about the resistance he faced at the time and the support he got from Rao.

‚ÄúWhen the reform period is written, I don‚Äôt know what the official narrative will be, but I for one know, it was a very tortuous path because the dominant opinion then was not in favour of reforms,‚Äù Singh said.

Singh said that in the business community there was the Bombay club which was formed to see that India does not move on the path of liberalisation, but he also knew that there was limited time due to dwindling reserves.

‚ÄúI had to tell president (then president) S Venkataraman that ‚ÄòMr president if we wait for a vote of confidence, I may have nothing to sell to the world about India‚Äôs story‚Äô,‚Äù Singh said.

‚ÄúI am very grateful to Prime Minister Rao that he stood by me. But I am also very grateful to Montek, to Chidambaram ji, to the then governor and deputy governor of the RBI who stood by me firmly so that we could carry out the reform process in the manner we wanted to,‚Äù he said.

During the panel discussion, Ahluwalia said there was no quiestion that India had entered a period of ‚Äúvery serious slowdown‚Äù.

He said that not only the drop in growth rate, but also rising unemployment among youth was a matter of concern.

Ahluwalia said he was against the restrospective taxation step of the UPA government, but it was not in his hands.

Chidambaram, in his remarks also acknowledged that the Congress party machinery had failed to take the economic achievements of the UPA years to the people.",https://thewire.in/politics/modi-government-does-not-acknowledge-the-word-slowdown-manmohan-singh,
"In 2020, Modi‚Äôs First Priority Should be to Right India‚Äôs Flailing Economic Ship","From hope to despair, it has been a quick descent. As the year draws to a close, a sense of uncertainty and a feeling of resignation has slowly taken over our minds. One can argue rightly that this is a transitory phase. All the same, the doubts are refusing to die away.

The reason for doubt is quite apparent. All the critical economic numbers ‚Äì from GDP (gross domestic product) to inflation figure and trade data ‚Äì don‚Äôt give any reason for comfort. The quick slide in GDP number to below 4.5% from 8% in just four quarters is causing too much of an anxiety across policy planners and common man alike.

Poor IIP (Index of Industrial Production) numbers and weak consumption demand combine to sketch a distressing picture. Not surprisingly, the numbers on capital formation and investment have not shown any healthy growth. A former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has summed up the state of the economy quite nicely with a new term ‚Äì ‚Äúgrowth recession‚Äù.

What is equally concerning is that the portents appear to be not good, with the World Bank warning of a substantial risk in global trade and growth in advanced economies slowing down. With little headroom on the fiscal front, the Centre appears to have been caught in a pincer-like situation. With the political atmosphere heating up by the day in the wake of Citizenship Amendment Bill and following the victories by the opposition in two states, the Modi government has its plate full.

If the macroeconomic picture is turning out to be increasingly worrisome, events at the micro level are hurting significantly investor perception, causing further damage to the overall economy. The Reserve Bank of India was forced to refer Dewan Housing to the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). The Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank imbroglio, which erupted just on the eve of Maharashtra State Assembly elections, has cut short the life of nearly half-a-dozen depositors even as unmindful political parties slugged it out to claim the right, nay power, to rule the state.

Prior to all this was the IL&FS debacle, setting off a chain of adverse reaction triggering a negative multiplier impact on the overall health of the economy. All these suggest to a dipping confidence level all around. There was also this Karvy fiasco, which saw promoters misusing the power of attorney given by clients for illegal fund-rising activity. It did so by pledging the shares of its clients!

How did all these scandals happen? Do we blame it on the inherent rot in the system? Should promoters be held accountable? What were India‚Äôs regulators doing? Where were the responsible characters in the entire chain while all this was happening? In all these instances, the real losers were common Indians, either as depositors or investors of one kind or the other.

The effect of 2019‚Äôs scams on the micro-level was palpable and felt instantly. On top of this though was the continuing agrarian crisis, a cause for farmer suicides. Somewhere along, the Modi government appears to have either allowed the situation to drift or not really gotten a hang of these fast-engulfing issues. When confidence in the economy is short and the threat of job loss high, a consumer has very little option but to exercise prudent and live only an existential life. This is having a chain reaction not just down the line but up the stream as well. Production, investment and everything else is reeling under the impact of this.

When senior industrialist Rahul Bajaj bluntly voiced the fear psychosis among its peers to home minister Amit Shaw in an open forum, probably he was articulating the exasperation experienced by the business community in the prevailing economic conditions. The fear reference made by Bajaj was somewhat sweeping, yet he managed to hit the nail on the head.

Is time running out for the Modi government to drive its men, machinery and ministers towards providing ‚Äòroti, kapda and makaan‚Äò rather than dissipating its energy on other diversionary issues?

As we slip into 2020, this will be a key question. The NDA government‚Äôs job is cut out and its first priority must be to to steady the rocking economic ship. No doubt, this government has not diluted its reform agenda. The fine-tuning of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ‚Äì its evolution, the recent amendment and the Supreme Court verdict in the Essar Steel case ‚Äì all give a sense of optimism in addressing the stressed asset problem of banks. The government‚Äôs disinvestment agenda, move for labour reforms and the like are equally important. These will take a while though to see results on the ground.

The near-term misery, however, requires a quick fix. The writing on the wall is all too clear. Action is what matters and not speeches from political podiums. The onus is definitely on the government. If the government can‚Äôt, nobody else can.

Facing the Reality: How Can Modi Reverse the Current Economic Slowdown?,"That the Indian economy is witnessing a slowdown is no longer a matter of debate after the Union finance minister acknowledged this reality. The days when the Indian economy was the fastest growing seemed distant when the second quarter of 2019-20 saw the growth stumble to 4.5%, the slowest in 26 quarters.

The three drivers of growth, namely, consumption, investment, and exports, have all moved downward. Consumption was reported to be at a four-decade low, with rural consumption lower by 8.8%, while urban consumption barely increased. In the second quarter of the current fiscal, gross fixed capital formation (at constant prices) grew by a mere 1% over the corresponding period of 2018-19, while exports recorded negative growth.

These numbers, in our view, reflect the combined impact of four factors, namely, policy shocks, agrarian crisis, steep increase in unemployment and steady decline in the share of wages and financial sector crisis.

Except for the first, the remaining three are structural impediments that have plagued the economy in the past decades.

Two policy shocks, namely, demonetisation and introduction of GST, were imparted in rapid succession. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) were especially impacted by demonetisation having lost 1.5 million jobs, according to estimates provided by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. The woes of the MSME sector were exacerbated by a poorly designed GST, which added a significant layer of uncertainty for the small businesses. The jobs and income losses resulting from the policy shocks caused demand shrinkage and sharp decline of investment.

India‚Äôs development model is skewed against the interests of the farm sector; the steadily falling share of the sector in the country‚Äôs GDP even when it supports an overwhelmingly large section of the working population. In 2005, the National Farmers‚Äô Commission (NFC) emphasised the need for amelioration of the condition of the farming community, especially by increasing minimum support price (MSP) and by extending it for other major crops.

After an initial interest shown by the UPA government to meaningfully increase MSP, this recommendation of the NFC has remained unimplemented. Consequently, the terms of trade between farmers and non-farmers, which had increased up to 2010-11, declined thereafter. At the same time, wages received by farm labour also became less remunerative: they grew by an annual average of nearly 17% between 2007-08 and 2013-14, but in the past three years, their growth was halved. These two developments squeezed rural demand.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 reported massive decline in agricultural employment and very slow growth of non-agricultural jobs. The unemployment rate stood at 6.1%, of which unemployment rate among the urban male youth was nearly 19% while the unemployment rate for urban female youth was 27% per cent. These figures were the highest in 45 years. Worse still, the total employment witnessed a net decline to 471.3 million in 2017‚Äì18 from 472.5 million in 2012‚Äîthe first ever absolute decline in the post-independence period.

As for the urban sector, KLMES database produced by the RBI, shows that employment growth in manufacturing dropped to 1.4% and in services to 2% between 2011 and 2017 from 2.5% and 2.8 % respectively between 2004 and 2010. During the same period, labour earnings in the manufacturing sector declined from 8.1 % to 5.4% and in the services sector, from 7.2% to 6.1%.

Thus, falling rural income and urban labour earnings as well as skewed income distribution have resulted in domestic demand contraction while falling export growth has affected external demand.

Despite continuous capitalisation of the banking sector in the past several years (Rs 1.06 lakh crore in 2018‚Äì19 followed by Rs 70,000 crores in 2019‚Äì20), non-performing assets continued to grow. It stood at Rs 8.06 lakh crore on March 31, 2019. Even the non-banking financial sector is passing through a crisis. For example, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services has reported a negative net worth of Rs 16,935 crore in FY 19. These obviously adversely affected commercial credit off-takes. Financial sector crisis, together with demand slackness and investor pessimism have negatively impacted investment.

The government has taken several initiatives, including cut in corporation tax and announcement of packages for reviving sectors like the real estate, automobiles and exports. Ironically, all these are essentially supply-side measures, which would make no impact on a demand-constrained economy.

What should the government have done instead? Putting purchasing power in the pockets of those having high marginal propensity to consume should have received the topmost priority. This can easily be done through increased spending on schemes like MGNREGA, and by investing in education, health services and rural infrastructure. Such spending can immediately spur demand, which in turn would create inducement for potential investors.

In an exercise evaluating the impact of MGNREGA and two other social security schemes using the Social Accounting framework, we found that the indirect impact of expenditure on such schemes is considerable. Direct expenditure on a scheme like MGNREGA induces 1.8 times increase in indirect income and twice the direct expenditure in pension or basic income type scheme.

The government can garner enough resources for financing the above-mentioned initiatives by realising the undisputed part of tax and non-tax arrears, which, at the end of 2017-18, were around Rs 9 lakh crore and Rs 2 lakh crores respectively. It could also monetise the huge chunk of surplus land available with the Ministries of Defence and Railways, which was one of the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

Over the medium-term, efforts must be made to increase the tax-GDP ratio, which is the lowest among major economies, by levying wealth tax, among others. Besides, the GST must be reviewed and redesigned through reduction in the number of tax rates and increasing the base, and by improving the GST Network that the indirect tax system needs in order to be effective. All these measures would boost demand which in turn induce investment and reverse the downward trajectory of economic growth.

"Opposition Says Budget 2020 Does Not Address Unemployment, Slowing Growth","New Delhi: While most leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party termed Budget 2020 as ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù and ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù, opposition leaders panned it as lacking any concrete ideas to address problems such as rising unemployment and plummeting growth rate.

Soon after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman finished the Budget speech, one of the longest in recent history, the BJP claimed that it addressed development for all sections of the society, on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas slogan.

‚Äú#JanJanKaBudget‚Äù: Union Budget 2020 ensures all-round development of all sections of the society. It will further fulfil PM Shri @narendramodi‚Äòs vision of making India a $5 trillion economy. https://t.co/CxTEgSCLeF ‚Äî BJP (@BJP4India) February 1, 2020



Within minutes, leaders from the saffron party took turns on Twitter to trend their praise with #JanJanKaBudget. However, not many pointed out why they felt it was visionary or futuristic.

PM Modi congratulated Sitharaman for preparing a Budget which he called was a mix of ‚Äúvision and action‚Äù. He went on to list out new reforms announced in the Budget.



The opposition leaders had concrete criticisms to offer.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ‚ÄúOur youth want jobs. Instead they got the longest budget speech in parliamentary history that said absolutely nothing of consequence. PM & FM both looked like they have absolutely no clue what to do next.‚Äù He said there was no central idea to rid India of unemployment or improve the poor state of the economy.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said that the Budget was ‚Äútoo long to absorb‚Äù.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P. Chidambaram briefed the media after the Budget. He said, ‚ÄúThere were multiple themes, segments and programmes, leaving the listener dazed and confused. It was a laundry list of old (that is current) programmes‚Ä¶ The government has given up on reviving the economy or accelerating the growth rate or promoting private investment or increasing efficiency or creating jobs or winning a greater share of world trade.‚Äù

Also Read: Budget 2020 Sidesteps the Question of What the Govt Should Do to Revive the Economy

‚ÄúThe Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved. The FM has not acknowledged these two challenges, and that is a pity,‚Äù he said, adding that the government was ‚Äúin complete denial that the economy faces a grave macro economic challenge and the growth rate has declined in six successive quarters.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is nothing in the Budget that leads us to believe that growth will revive in 2020-21. The claim of 6-6.5% growth next year is astonishing and even irresponsible,‚Äù he said.

As an advocate of market economy, he lashed out at the government for adhering to protectionist policies. However, he also criticised it for reducing food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies.

‚ÄúIt appears that the people will not get any relief on the price front. Please remember that CPI inflation is over 7% and food inflation is over 10%,‚Äù he said, adding there is no assurance that the finance minister will meet the targets set for 2020-21.

He also said that the government rejected every reform idea contained in the Economic Survey. ‚ÄúDid the FM read the Economic Survey? Was the chief economic adviser privy to the contents of the Budget speech? I think the answer to both questions is in the negative.‚Äù

Government clueless: CPI(M)

Calling the government ‚Äúclueless‚Äù about how to address the current economic crisis, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Modi Government is only interested in providing the corporate sector and the wealthy relief rather than tackling the increasingly grim employment and livelihood situations of the working people ‚Äì workers, farmers and those forced into self-employment ‚Äì which is the root cause of the slowdown.‚Äù

It said that instead of increasing its social spending to address the demand crunch, the Budget has only aimed at ‚Äúreducing the fiscal deficit by further slashing government expenditures‚Ä¶the burden of which will be felt by working people.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶the expenditures on Central Sector Schemes in 2019-20 has been slashed by 11 per cent and Centrally Sponsored Schemes by 4.5 per cent ‚Äì covering areas like ‚Äì food subsidies, agriculture and allied activities, Development of the North-East, Social Welfare, Energy, etc. In the cuts proposed in 2020-21, MNREGA (Rs. 61,500 crore from Rs. 71,000 crore) and fertilizer subsidies are slated to join this list. Even the flagship schemes like PMJAY-Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat and PM-Kisan have suffered major cuts. Allocations for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, already way below the statutory requirements, have been cut in 2019-20. The Gender Budget allocation for 2020-21 similarly shows stagnation,‚Äù the Left party said in its statement, also adding that the government manipulated revised estimates of revenue figures.

‚ÄúRevised Estimates (RE) figures show that the revenue collections in 2018-19 are way below the Budget Estimates (BE), still they underestimate the extent of the shortfall. The RE figures of Central Tax Revenues are incompatible with the actual collections reported by the CGA for April-December of 2019-20. A realistic RE would have shown a further shortfall of close to 1.5 lakh crores in gross revenues from central taxes.‚Äù

He also lashed out at the government‚Äôs proposals to indirectly privatise BSNL and LIC. ‚ÄúMore importantly, the LIC sale would be used to compensate the states on GST.

Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚ÄòBudget of Giveaways‚Äô Will Not Help India's Broken Economy,"It could have been the best budget India had had in the past decade. And the shortest. Instead, it was the worst and the longest. Early in January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a quiet meeting with fifteen of India‚Äôs top industrialists to get their views on how to revive the economy. Apologising to them, for not having met them earlier, and not being able to meet them one-on-one even now, for shortage of time, he said:

‚ÄúPlease treat this as 15 one-on-one meetings, and tell me exactly what you believe will start the economy growing again. Please take as much time as you want. I will take notes on what you say.‚Äù

And that is what he did. There was a junior officer from the PMO in a corner of the room, who took notes. Halfway through the meeting, Modi began to take notes himself.

Among the industrialists, a consensus emerged on three issues: the need to revive stalled infrastructure projects instead of abandoning them and starting afresh, as new projects would prove far more expensive and take longer to complete; to make this possible by re-creating a purely investment bank on the lines of the old Industrial Development Bank of India, fund it to the tune of Rs 200,000 crore or thereabouts and get it to buy a large portion of the shares of the stressed companies, so that they became viable once more; and to bring down the GST from the present average of 22% to 15%, as had originally been suggested by Arvind Subramaniam, among others, when he was the chief economic adviser.

One other ingredient needed to complete the formula for recovery ‚Äì a further sharp lowering of lending rates by commercial banks to enable stressed companies to refinance their accumulated debt at a lower rate of interest (as the state governments had done after A.B. Vajpayee‚Äôs finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, had slashed lending rates in 2001 and 2002) remained unresolved. But had Nirmala Sitharaman even announced the other three measures, the Sensex would have shot up by 1,000 points instead of falling by an equal amount.

But Sitharaman was not present at the meeting. Nor was there any hint in the Economic Survey that she might have been briefed by the prime minister. Indeed the absence of any meaningful coordination between the PMO and the Ministry of Finance was visible in the Economic Survey, presented yesterday, for the survey once again described the economic crisis as a ‚Äòcyclical slowdown‚Äô, and recommended what is usually called ‚Äòpump priming‚Äô ‚Äì an infusion of spending power into the economy to boost demand. And that is about all that Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚Äòbudget of giveaways‚Äô will achieve.

Spending power and economic recovery

Will more spending power suffice to trigger an economic recovery. The drop in the Sensex shows that the market knows it will not. For what India is in the throes of is not a (trade) cyclical slowdown but an economic breakdown. Cyclical slowdowns automatically reverse themselves of one waits long enough. Two centuries of experience of the industrialised market economies has shown that the usual trade cycle rarely takes more than seven years to complete itself. India‚Äôs ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù ‚Äì the so-called downward phase of this ‚Äúcycle‚Äù, is now in its ninth year. It is therefore time for this government to concede that India is suffering not an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown.

Also Read: With No Big Bang Steps, Budget 2020 Focuses on Untangling the Fiscal Math Mess

Clinging to the politically convenient belief that all we are suffering from is a slowdown has prevented the government from even mapping, let alone applying, the remedies that are needed to re-start economic growth. For all that it has done so far is to get the RBI to bring its main policy interest rate, the Repo rate, down from 6.5% to 5.15% between February and October 2019. This has, predictably, done nothing to halt the slide down in India‚Äôs GDP growth rate from 6.8% in 2018-19 to an expected 4.9% this year.

The blame for this is now being put upon commercial banks, who are being castigated for passing on less than a third of this rate cut to borrowers. But the policy making apparatus of the RBI and the Ministry of Finance has shied away from asking why they are not doing so. The answer, which they undoubtedly know but are not willing to discuss, is that such a large proportion of their loans is now irrecoverable, that they are no longer able to meet their interest commitments to depositors and various government subsidisation programmes. They cannot therefore be blamed for fearing that a further reduction of lending rates will tip them into the red.

How has India‚Äôs vibrant economy been broken? The single, short answer is, ‚Äòby a regime of monstrously high rates of interest born out of the RBI‚Äôs unquestioning, and economically stupid, adoption of the doctrine of ‚Äúinflation targeting‚Äù. This doctrine was coined in 1992 by the Bank of England and adopted with alacrity by industrialised countries and the IMF because it yielded not only price but also exchange rate stability. The rich nations needed the latter even more than the former because it was an absolute pre-requisite for maintaining their currencies as the reserve currencies of the world, and attracting the export surpluses, and private savings of the wealthy in the rest of the world as capital transfers into their banks. Faced with de-industrialisation, a shrinking tax base and mounting social security commitments to an ageing population at home, these inflows were essential for allowing them to continue living beyond their shrinking means.

To the rich nations, price stability was the end in itself, so knowing the cause of the inflation was not important. But for developing countries knowing whether it was an excess of demand or shortages of supply was a matter of life and death. For imposing high interest rates on an economy where prices were rising because of shortages of supply could only worsen the shortages and push up prices further. In short inflation targeting in a shortage ridden economy produced not growth but stagflation.

If stagflation is allowed to persist long enough, it ends not in an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown. That is what India is in the throes of today. By the middle of 2018, India had Rs 1,160,000 crores worth of abandoned projects, nearly all in infrastructure and heavy industry; the public sector banks had more than Rs 9,60,000 crores of irrecoverable debt and had lost their capacity to lend, and this had created a funds crisis in the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) sector, which oiled the wheels of the economy through its various rapid payment systems.

The capacity and willingness to take risk

What was worse, eight years of relentless inflation targeting by the RBI, begun in March 2010, had ended by destroying entrepreneurship ‚Äì the capacity and willingness to take risk, which is the essential fourth requirement of modern economic growth (after land, labour and capital). By June 2018, 78 of the largest companies in the country were facing dissolution under the Indian Bankruptcy Code. Of them, 20 had already been declared insolvent and sent to the National Company Law Tribunal for dissolution.

Another 30 companies, all in the power sector, were facing the same fate because the Allahabad high court had denied them more time to sort out their woes. The debt of these companies alone amounted to Rs 140,000 crore. Another 92 companies were headed for the chopping block because they were more than 180 days behind on their loan repayments.

"As India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown Deepens, Is It Time to Reconsider Cash Transfers to the Poor?","India‚Äôs precarious economic situation has everyone worried and rightly so. Two weeks ago, we got news that India‚Äôs nominal GDP growth is at its lowest in 45 years. Even that is perhaps a rosier picture than the ground reality according to the former chief economic advisor of the Narendra Modi government who has cast doubts over GDP measurement and said that the measured GDP is overstated. There is simply no dispute that India‚Äôs economic growth has collapsed, regardless of how and who measures it. So, what is the way out of this mess?

Several economic commentators, finance ministers and Nobel laureates are now in consensus about the remedy: stimulating demand in the economy. Nobel laureate Esther Duflo recently called for a ‚ÄòTUP‚Äô policy ‚Äì targeting the ultra-poor by giving them cash which they will spend immediately. Bengal‚Äôs finance minister Amit Mitra in a recent interview specifically called for a direct cash transfer to the poorest sections of society to stimulate consumption. Another Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said that the situation is so egregious that fiscal deficit concerns should not be a hurdle to boosting demand through a stimulus package. Nearly every major newspaper has carried an editorial calling for a demand stimulus. Never before has there been such an overwhelming consensus in an economic policy prescription for the country across all hues of commentators.

Not too long ago, there was precisely such an idea proposed for the Indian economy. An idea to target 20% of the poorest households in every district in the country and give them a direct cash transfer of Rs 6,000 a month which would then stimulate demand and revive private investment, which in turn would lead to more jobs and a healthier economy. The idea was called NYAY, which was part of the manifesto of the Congress party for the 2019 parliament elections.

The Congress party diagnosed the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy, assembled a group of experts, and presented a solution to pull the nation out of the impending economic crisis. In fact, the party believed in it so strongly that NYAY became the centrepiece of the campaign, contrary to some recent fallacious narratives that the economy was not the focus of the Congress party‚Äôs campaign.

Of course, the party could not convince voters, either because the NYAY message did not reach enough people or voters did not believe the message. Regardless, just nine months later, the same idea to revive a sagging economy by stimulating demand through cash transfers to the poor is now a consensus prescription.

The Modi government should not be churlish to dismiss this consensus solution of experts to pull our economy out of distress, only because the Congress party originated the idea. Economics and governance should transcend politics. The ‚ÄòSarva Shiksha Abhiyan‚Äô was pioneered by the Vajpayee government and carried forward by all successive governments, the Aadhaar programme was mooted by the Congress party and continued by the Modi government amid many such examples of policy ideas adopted across governments and political parties. NYAY, in perhaps a different shape and form, remains the most relevant solution to our current economic crisis and the Modi government should embrace it.

The Modi government has been whimsical and knee-jerk in their prescriptions for the economic crisis, like a deer caught in headlights. Out of the blue, one day in September, just before the prime minister embarked on his visit to the US, the finance minister announced a steep reduction in corporate tax rates and claimed that it would cost the exchequer nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore and help revive the economy. Even a cursory analysis would have revealed that a corporate tax cut at this juncture would only be used by corporates to reduce their loan liabilities and not to invest more in capacity building since consumer demand is very weak.

If using the same amount, had five crore poorest households been given say Rs 5,000 a month for six months, the poor would have spent it immediately, fueling demand and reviving private investment. Of course, such a move would not have elicited the blaring headlines in the media the next day that the corporate tax cut announcement did. Four months later, it is now acknowledged that the corporate tax cuts were mere hogwash.

Why can‚Äôt states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab or Chhattisgarh ‚Äì governed by the Congress party ‚Äì implement NYAY is the other common refrain one hears. NYAY was conceived as a scheme that will be implemented by both the Centre and states, which would give it the required fiscal capacity. Post-GST, state governments have lost all powers of generating their own tax revenues for state-specific programmes. So, even if say, the Rajasthan government wants to raise taxes on other goods to generate funds for cash transfer to the poor, it cannot do so.

Also Read: Can the Government Increase Spending to Escape the Slowdown?

In fact, a democratically elected chief minister of a state in today‚Äôs India has almost no powers to raise revenues for her state since both direct and indirect taxes are controlled by the Centre or the GST Council. Hence, a scheme like NYAY cannot be implemented at the state level any longer, which is a travesty of federalism.

The keys to the solution to India‚Äôs current economic catastrophe is only with the Union government in Delhi. The solution is to revive demand by putting money in the hands of the poor.

Our analysis for NYAY showed that it is both possible to target the poorest households as well as pay for the scheme through a combination of expenditure rationalisation and a modest fiscal expansion. The PM needs to act boldly and decisively. Now is not the time to indulge in petty quibbles over ownership of ideas. Let us all agree that good policy ideas belong to the people of the nation.

Economic Slump: India‚Äôs Rickety Bridge Over Troubled Waters,"Raghuram Rajan, the-then outgoing Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in an exit interview he granted to Karan Thapar (‚ÄòTo The Point‚Äô, YouTube, September 2, 2016), took satisfaction from the fact that India was ‚Äúon a more sustainable growth path‚Äù.

The remark turned out to be premature. Less than two years later, starting the first quarter of FY 18/19, ominous signs of weaknesses started to emerge. GDP growth, which has been sliding continuously over six quarters, reached 4.5% per annum in the second quarter of FY 19/20. The slide may not be over yet.

If engineers inspecting a bridge find serious structural weaknesses, they can only conclude that the bridge is unsafe. But, their science cannot predict when the bridge will come down. Similarly, a detailed analysis of structural economic weaknesses cannot predict the timing of the next slump. Economists can at best be faulted for not being cognizant enough of the risks to the sustainability of growth.

The euphoria about India‚Äôs prospects following the economic reforms of 1991 is understandable. After all, growth had averaged just about 3.5% per annum in the pre-reform period. Moreover, the economy‚Äôs performance was more volatile with brief spurts in growth punctuated by painful crashes. The opening up of the economy through less state intervention not only ratcheted growth upwards to about 7% per annum on average, they came with far less volatility.

According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), some 271 million Indians were lifted out of poverty between 2005/06 and 2016/17. Reports issued by various large US multinational companies like Cisco, Citi and PwC held out the possibility that India would become the second-largest economy in the world after China and possibly an advanced country by 2050. The findings were reported by several major international and Indian newspapers.

Laudable as those achievements were, growth was not inclusive. While the top 1% of earners walked away with 22% of national income, the top 10% accounted for a whopping 56%. Had growth been inclusive, the resulting rise in incomes and opportunities would have been equitably shared by all income groups sharply reducing inequality over time. It is not surprising why attaining inclusive growth is far more difficult than boosting growth rates themselves.

Why India‚Äôs growth story is not sustainable

In a recent article (Why Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste? What India Needs to Remember to Overcome its Economic Slump, The Wire, November 20, 2019), I pointed out that corruption and poor governance have not only spawned rising income inequality but a host of other economic maladies as well. I was not trying to explain the downturn in terms of some recent developments like the collapse in consumption. Rather, I was referring to the structural weaknesses in the Indian economy as the genesis of India‚Äôs current economic predicament.

While it is possible for highly corrupt countries to register impressive rates of growth for a few years, widespread and entrenched corruption will thwart the sustainability of growth. Studies by the IMF and other international organisations point out a number of serious consequences of corruption.

First, corruption reduces the rate of growth. As a result, poverty in India could have been reduced at a faster pace were it not for corruption. The United Nations, based on data produced by the World Economic Forum, noted that the worldwide cost of corruption is at least 5% of global GDP.

Also read: The Short-Term and Long-Term Measures Needed to Reverse India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown

Second, as I noted earlier, weakly governed countries tend to invest far less in health and education than strongly-governed ones. Thus, when growth takes place, only the elites can take advantage of the expanded opportunities whereas the vast majority cannot qualify for well-paid jobs in the organised sector. They are left with little alternative but to eke out a living working in low-skill jobs in the informal sector. In short, countries with endemic corruption also tend to be highly unequal.

In fact, income inequality based on officially reported incomes collected through household income surveys significantly understate actual inequality. This is because the upper income groups, who are the main drivers of black money incomes and assets, understate their incomes in household surveys conducted by the government. If reported incomes were to include black money incomes generated from domestic and foreign assets, actual inequality would be worse than calculated inequality based on official income data.

The greater actual inequality would have a larger destabilising effect than the measures available to economists would suggest. Assuming demonetisation left corruption intact, domestic black monies transferred abroad would return another day as inflows to drive up the stock market and other investments. Such round-tripping is often an elaborate scheme to launder dirty money.

Black money is mainly used to finance illegal and speculative transactions rather than boost productive investments in the official economy. In fact, while legitimate domestic investments have been on a declining trend, inflows of black money did nothing to help the economy. Regardless of how much black money was captured and surrendered to banks and how much could be traced to illegal activities, corruption cannot be curtailed without strengthening governance in all its aspects such as rule of law, effectiveness of regulatory oversight, quality and stability of politics, etc. To claim that demonetisation will curtail corruption is like putting on a winter jacket and expecting it to snow.

Third, wide-spread corruption leads to tax evasion by promoting a culture that tolerates the practice. The IMF finds that even among developed countries, strongly-governed ones collect about 4.5% of GDP more than relatively more corrupt ones. And that‚Äôs a lot of money the government could have used productively. The longer corruption rules, the more difficult it gets to dislodge it. In fact, as I have argued in my earlier article, corruption has restricted India‚Äôs fiscal space thereby significantly limiting the scope of a consumption-boosting targeted basic income.

Also read: India is Now in Classic Stagflation Territory

Fourth, corruption has reduced the effectiveness of government services through bribery, a reduction in compliance with government regulations, and the imposition of additional costs on investment projects. India‚Äôs ‚ÄúD‚Äù rated government effectiveness has led to a lack of public trust in officials and the quality of government services. This in turn promotes tax evasion because taxpayers do not feel that they are getting their money‚Äôs worth.

Fifth, researchers at the IMF found that child and infant mortality rates as well as the proportion of low-birthweight babies in countries with endemic corruption are much higher compared to countries where corruption is low. Moreover, school dropout rates are five times as high partly due to less effective government spending. The poor quality of public school education in India is consistent with these findings.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis.

Finally, highly corrupt countries tend to be much more polluted than countries that are strongly governed. India is a perfect example of the nexus between rampant corruption and serious environmental degradation.

The tendency towards greater pollution is explained by the poor law and order, lack of environmental awareness, weak environmental regulations and their enforcement, bribery of regulatory officials, and a dearth of equipment and trained manpower to monitor compliance with regulations.

Hence, it is crucial to attain economic growth that is not only inclusive but environmentally sustainable as well. Inclusive policies by themselves cannot ensure that industries would comply with policies to protect the environment.

Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University, finds that the fault lies in formulating economic policies which do not treat fresh water, clean air, and land as resources which could be depleted in the production process. Given that no country has an inexhaustible supply of these resources, there is a dire need for appropriate regulation, monitoring for compliance, and user fees to pay for clean-up and renewal. His work shows that environmental degradations will effectively derail economic growth if policies are not designed to take explicit account of these consequences.

Also read: GDP Data: Investment Growth at 19-Quarter Low Despite Modi Govt‚Äôs Stimulus Measures

This is not to suggest that growth strategies necessarily need to evolve from a low to a higher trajectory through reform before they can be inclusive as well as sustainable. Countries like Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan which made significantly larger investments in health and education were not only successful in ensuring more equitable outcomes and opportunities when growth occurred but have also avoided environmental degradation from limiting growth in the long run.

The primacy of volition

Even though structural issues are deeply embedded and take far longer to mitigate than counter-cyclical policies aimed at stimulating the economy, here too governments can do a lot more than pray.

Vito Tanzi, a fiscal expert and one-time director of the IMF‚Äôs fiscal affairs department, in an article on corruption around the world, opined that successful efforts against corruption typically begin with examples set by a country‚Äôs leadership. Top political leaders should not only provide the right example of honest living but should support stern legal action against corruption from any quarter regardless of political affiliations. If, on the other hand corrupt acts by friends, relatives, or political associates are condoned, then it would not be realistic to expect that public officials or indeed the country at large will behave honestly.

The first step on the road to redemption is therefore the hardest one‚Äîleaders should set the right example, help support the appropriate laws, and implement a distinct plan for tackling corruption in all its manifestations. In short, the anti-corruption agenda must be strongly underwritten by the country‚Äôs leadership and the state governments as well. India needs to reduce corruption on a credible and sustained basis in order to better cushion the impact of difficult global economic conditions.

Global economic headwinds

In October, the IMF cut its forecast for this year‚Äôs global growth to 3.0% from 3.9% in January. Strong headwinds facing major economies such as geopolitical instability, business uncertainties, tariffs, and trade tensions, were responsible for the more somber outlook. The US Federal Reserve Bank began to cut its overnight lending rate to banks in July this year. The lending rate was lowered in three steps to a target range of 1.5 to 1.75% in October.

With the European Central Bank‚Äôs policy rate already in negative territory, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cuts were accompanied by a significant decline in long-term bond yields. Stock markets are surging because of falling long-term interest rates and higher bond prices, not in spite of them.

Also read: The Dangers of Dismantling India‚Äôs Public Sector

The reason is investors have nowhere to place their funds to make a decent return other than in stock markets and other riskier investments, thereby driving their growth. So, there is no contradiction between weakening economies on the one hand and surging stock markets on the other.

While the easy money of central banks is meant to prop up slackening economic growth, the downside is that low interest rates are encouraging households to incur more debt and firms to take on greater financial risks. The corporate sector in India is carrying a heavy debt load and some may default on their loan repayments and fold, while others may require a rollover of debt or some sort of corporate debt restructuring.

Conclusion

We can expect the world economy to enter a protracted period of low growth, low demand, and low-inflation, its driving gear stuck in neutral. While well-heeled investors and pension funds around the world have earned handsome returns in the soaring stock markets and other riskier assets, these are dark waters.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis and impose a heavy cost in terms of lost output, income, and jobs, along with an increasing risk of economic and political instability. These structural weaknesses need to be addressed on an urgent basis.

"In World's Biggest Early Childcare Scheme, Workers Don't Even Get Minimum Wage","Mysuru, Tumakuru and Ballari, Karnataka: The mud-and-bamboo anganwadi is about three kilometres from her house, deep inside the Nagarhole National Park and Tiger Reserve in Mysuru district, Karnataka. But little keeps Sita B., a young Yerwa tribe woman, from walking the distance every day to the Manamelkudi village anganwadi, where she works as worker and helper.

On the way, she picks up fresh vegetables and eggs to serve 14 children of the Jenu Kuruba tribe, aged three to six years, registered with the anganwadi. There are nine more children aged six months to three years, and Sita gives them their monthly share of take-home rations under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme of the Government of India.

ICDS is the world‚Äôs largest programme for early childhood care and development, with over 158 million children (2011 Census) in the 0-6 years age group, and pregnant and lactating mothers in the country. It offers six services: supplementary nutrition, preschool non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-up and referral services, through 1.36 million functional anganwadi centres spread across all the districts in the country (as of June 2018).

¬ß

According to the Union health ministry‚Äôs Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-2018, 32.5% of children younger than five years in Karnataka are stunted (lower height for age) and 12.4% are severely stunted. Over 32% are underweight (lower weight for age) and 19.3% are wasted (lower weight for height). A little over 34% of children aged one to four years also have anaemia.

The national scenario isn‚Äôt better. The same survey found that 35%, 33% and 17% of children under five in the country are stunted, underweight and wasted, respectively. About 11% of children aged six to 59 months months were in fact found to be acutely malnourished.

The Karnataka state department of women and child development has launched multiple schemes to fight malnutrition and is implementing them through anganwadi centres. For example, under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme, children aged six months to six years receive 150 ml of cream milk five days a week, supplied by the state government at a cost of Rs 124.14 crore per annum.

As part of the Srusti programme, children aged three to six years at anganwadi centres are provided eggs twice a week. Severely malnourished children aged six months to three years are provided eggs three days a week, whereas severely malnourished children aged three years to six years are offered eggs five days a week.

Apart from its 50% share under the ICDS, the Karnataka government gives Rs 11.50 per pregnant and lactating woman under Mathrupoorna, a scheme that grants nutritious meals, counselling and other healthcare facilities to pregnant and lactating women at anganwadi centres for six days a week.

Families with children who have severe acute malnutrition receive Rs 2,000 in medical benefits, plus Rs 1,000 a year for medicine kits at each anganwadi centre in the state.

The data suggests all these schemes together have had appreciable effect. For instance, 36.2% of children under five in Karnataka were stunted according to the 2015-2016 National Family Health Survey and 32.5% in the 2016-2018 survey. Similarly, wasting in children younger than five years has dropped from 26.1% in 2015-2016 to 19.3% in 2016-2018, and the fraction of underweight children has dropped from 35.2% to 32%.

These achievements also highlight the centrality of anganwadi centres ‚Äì and the women who work there ‚Äì to the state‚Äôs ambitions regarding the health and care of its most vulnerable people.

The ICDS population norms specify one centre for a population of 800 and a mini-anganwadi for a population of 150 to 300. According to the state department of women and child development, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi centres: 62,580 are main and 3,331 are mini-centres.

These centres are staffed by frontline health staff: one anganwadi worker and one anganwadi helper each, both typically women. Thus, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi workers and 62,580 anganwadi helpers. All the anganwadis together cater to the needs of 3.86 million children between the ages of six months to six years.

¬ß

The tribal village of Manamelkudi is home to 42 Jenu Kuruba tribe families and has a mini-anganwadi centre, where Sita works as worker and helper both.

‚ÄúI have been working at the Manamelkudi anganwadi for the last five years and am used to walking three kilometres to the centre [every day]. Sometimes I feel scared of tiger or elephant attacks, which are common in [the] forest area,‚Äù Sita told The Wire. She receives a monthly honorarium of Rs 4,750.

Managing children, their daily meals, preschool lessons, health and hygiene, and counselling pregnant and lactating mothers isn‚Äôt easy because she has to do it all alone. (Per ICDS norms, there can be only one worker-cum-helper per mini-anganwadi.)

However, Sita has been able to make sure the children in her anganwadi eat their meals hot, cooked freshly by her, and drink clean water. She also regularly monitors their growth and records the information in their respective growth charts. Unfortunately, the Manamelkudi anganwadi does not have a toilet.

Not very far away lies Balle, another Jenu Kuruba tribal village lying inside the Nagarhole National Park. It has two anganwadi centres and both function from the same tin-shed structure, without a toilet.

‚ÄúOur anganwadis [have been] operating since 2010, when they were located inside a government school building,‚Äù Pushpa, one of the anganwadi workers. ‚ÄúA few years ago, the school building collapsed but the forest department didn‚Äôt permit new construction, so we are functioning out of a tin-shed structure.‚Äù

Sharda, the other worker, said the forest department had recently okayed a new anganwadi building and that it was expected to come up soon.

There are about 14 anganwadi centres functioning inside the boundaries of the Nagarhole forest. This isn‚Äôt easy. There is a constant threat of animal attack, and the anganwadi workers and helpers come from houses located far away. It is difficult to find educated local tribal women to work at an anganwadi because a worker has to be college-educated and an anganwadi helper has to have studied till at least class IV.

It is women like Sita, Sharda, Pushpa and thousands more who form the backbone of the ICDS scheme.

As it happens, they are not happy.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding the legal minimum wage from the government but the Central government has been deaf to our demands,‚Äù S. Varalakshmi, president of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers‚Äô Association, told The Wire. ‚ÄúIt is not ready to compensate us adequately for the labour and the number of hours we put in.‚Äù

In April 2017, Karnataka raised the honoraria for anganwadi workers and helpers from Rs 4,000 and Rs 3,000 a month to Rs 8,000 and Rs 4,000 a month, respectively. The state government also reimburses their medical expenses to the tune of Rs 50,000 a year and provides pension. Additionally, the state department of women and child development has supplied twin-burner stoves, LPG cylinders and water filters to all anganwadi centres in the state.

Last October, the state government decided to further increase the monthly salaries of anganwadi workers and helpers to Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively, and of mini-anganwadi to about Rs 6,500. ‚ÄúThe state government has sanctioned higher honoraria but the same have not been implemented thus far due to some technical glitches,‚Äù Varalakshmi said. ‚ÄúIt is expected to be fixed soon.‚Äù

However, the Union ministry of women and child development has approved a much lower salary amount. In September 2018, it issued a circular on ‚Äúenhancement of honorarium‚Äù of anganwadi workers from Rs 3,000 per month to Rs 4,500 per month. The pay for anganwadi helpers was raised from Rs 1,500 per month to Rs 2,250 per month. For mini-anganwadi worker-cum-helper, the ministry approved just Rs 3,500 per month.

Varalakshmi alleged the Centre was trying to push the entire burden onto the states. ‚ÄúEarlier, the honorarium for anganwadi workers and helpers was shared between Centre and the states in the ratio of 90:10. Now, the Centre has revised it to 60:40,‚Äù she said. According to her, anganwadi workers should get at least Rs 18,000 per month and helpers Rs 9,000 per month. Kerala is the only state that provides minimum wages to all workers. The Goa government offers a monthly salary of about Rs 13,000, and both Haryana and Andhra Pradesh give Rs 11,000 per month.

Is this enough?

Anganwadi workers and helpers in various states, including Karnataka, have been demanding a raise. Last December, anganwadi workers across Karnataka launched a protest against the state government‚Äôs decision to start pre-primary classes in government schools . There were protests in Belagavi for delays in the release of incentives for anganwadi workers and helpers.

¬ß

The Karnataka government has a ‚Äòconvergence‚Äô programme as part of which it uses funds allocated for the fulfilment of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) to build anganwadi centres in the state.

For example, the anganwadi in Somlara village of Tumakuru district is 14 years old. For the first 12, it operated out of a rented space against a payment of Rs 700 per month. Two years ago, the government erected a new anganwadi building with Rs 6 lakh from MGNREGA funds.

‚ÄúOne of the villagers donated four gunthe of land to construct the anganwadi. Children love the new anganwadi and parents are also happy sending them here,‚Äù T.K. Bhagyamma, the anganwadi worker at Somlara, told The Wire.

At Giriyammanapalya village in Madhugiri, Reshma has been managing an anganwadi centre since 2007. ‚ÄúUntil April 2018, I was running the anganwadi from a rented place. In May 2018, a new anganwadi building was constructed with MGNREGA fund,‚Äù she said.

Indeed, these new buildings are swanky and spacious, with separate kitchens and tiled toilets. Many of them have attached gardens as well, and vegetables grown there are used to prepare meals for the children.

Srikanth, deputy director of the department of women and child development for Tumakuru, said, ‚ÄúWe follow a 60:40 ratio ‚Äì 60% fund is the wage component and 40% is for building materials. The wage component is [obtained] from MGNREGA and the rest ‚Ä¶ is shared with the Union ministry of women and child development and the state department.‚Äù

Thus Tumakuru alone has built 450 anganwadi centres using MGNREGA funds ‚Äì the highest in the state.

Data from the state department of women and child development suggests a large number of anganwadi centres still continue to function out of rented spaces, such as schools, community halls, etc., but the state expects to cover them under the convergence scheme in a phased manner.

But while the government has been modernising anganwadis and introducing new programmes, the workers say their demand for better pay remains unaddressed.

‚ÄúThe labour of women is never seen as labour, but viewed as a service,‚Äù Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher and a member of the ‚ÄòRight to Food‚Äô campaign in Karnataka, told The Wire. ‚ÄúThe language used in the context of their work is ‚Äòhonorarium‚Äô and not ‚Äòsalary‚Äô. This discrimination has to go and they should be treated as employees and not workers or helpers.‚Äù

Sundaramma has for the last decade been working as an anganwadi helper at Yerahalli village in H.D. Kote block, Mysuru. A short distance away, at the second anganwadi centre in Yerahalli, Nagaveni has been working as a helper for 17 years. Ask them if they‚Äôre satisfied with their salaries and they go quiet.

Gayathri, an anganwadi supervisor in H.D. Kote block, said she oversees a hundred anganwadi centres; Chandibai, a supervisor in Madhugiri block of Tumakuru, said she oversees 68 centres. The norm however is only 25 centres per supervisor.

In February 2019, anganwadi workers marched to the Parliament in Delhi to protest against the Centre‚Äôs reluctance to increase their pay and pension. In October the same year, anganwadi workers and helpers in Jharkhand protested demanding higher salaries.

In a country with such high malnutrition, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the crucial role these women play as frontline health workers. Without them and their labour, the world‚Äôs largest programme to ensure good quality early childhood care and development would flop.

"Job Growth Data Shows Even 5,000 Years Not Enough to Structurally Transform Indian Economy","A long-run perspective can often produce insights that remain obscured in short-run analyses. Take the problem of employment generation in India. It is accepted by many academics and analysts that India has not been able to address the problem of employment in recent years. In fact, the problem is far worse than even such well-informed, pessimistic analyses would suggest. And given that policy discussions about the Indian economy are bound to pick up around the coming budget, this long-run perspective might be of some use.

To get at the enormity of the problem, let us adopt a long-run perspective like the pioneers of development economists. Following the seminal work of one such pioneer, W. Arthur Lewis, let us conceptualise the Indian economy as consisting of two segments. The first segment comprises what we can call the ‚Äòsubsistence economy‚Äô, while the second segment forms the ‚Äòmodern, capitalist economy‚Äô.

Productivity and incomes are far higher in the modern segment than in the subsistence segment. Hence, addressing the problem of underdevelopment means transferring the labour force from the subsistence to the modern segment of the economy. Development economists refer to this process as a ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô of the economy. The problem of employment will only begin to be meaningfully addressed when the Indian economy has completed its structural transformation.

Indian employment trends

According to the World Development Indicators Database of the World Bank, in 1990, India‚Äôs labour force was 317.68 million; by 2019, it had grown to 517.49 million in 2019. Thus, over these three decades, India‚Äôs labour force grew at 1.69% per year.

What fraction of India‚Äôs labour force is in what we have called the subsistence segment? To a first approximation, we can identify the subsistence segment with those who are informally employed. These are the workers who are employed in low-productivity, low-paying, precarious work ‚Äì without job security, without social security and with minimal rights.

Watch | Interview: ‚ÄòPopulist Economic Policies Must Go, Addressing Labour Income Urgent‚Äô: Nitin Desai

There is a lot of uncertainty about the exact distribution of the labour force into formal and informal employment. Estimates of informal employment range from 93% to 85% of total employment. To get as optimistic picture as possible, let us use an estimate that is lower than all existing ones ‚Äì so let us assume that the subsistence segment in India employs 80% of the labour force.

Before developing the argument further, an important issue needs to be addressed. Even in advanced capitalist economies like the United States, a small fraction of the labour force is informally employed ‚Äì these are the precariously employed, low-wage workers. In fact, the growing use of temporary, in the the place of permanent, employees has been a characteristic of the neoliberal era since the early 1980s. Thus, advanced capitalist economies have been witnessing a rise of precarious employment.

This troubling phenomenon possibly signals a reversal of the structural transformation that advanced capitalist countries had completed in the 2.5 decades after the Second World War ‚Äì a trend that has led some economists to even characterise the US economy as a dual economy, a term that is typically reserved for underdeveloped countries.

Taking this fact into consideration, let us conceive of the completion of structural transformation not as the complete disappearance of the subsistence segment, but rather its continued existence as a small portion of the total economy. Therefore, let us assume that 10% of employment will remain informal even in an economy that has completed structural transformation.

Structural transformation in the Indian economy

Let us now pose the main question. How fast must employment grow in the modern, capitalist segment for structural transformation to be completed in a reasonable period of time?

Also read: Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea

In Table 1, I compute the annual growth rate of employment in the modern capitalist segment that would be required to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy (when only 10% of employment will be in the subsistence segment) in 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 years. I compute the ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rate under two alternative scenarios: in the first scenario, the labour force grows at the rate that we have observed it to be growing over the last three decades; in the second, decidedly unrealistic, scenario, the labour force does not grow.

What do the numbers in Table 1 say? If the labour force continues to grow at the same rate at which it is currently growing, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 4.8% per annum to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy in 50 years. If the structural transformation is to be completed in 100 years, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 3.23% per annum. If, as is extremely unlikely, the labour force stops growing from this year onwards, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 1.52% per annum to complete the structural transformation in 100 years.

To put these ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rates into perspective, we only need to ask: how fast has employment in the modern capitalist segment been growing in India over the past few decades? According to the Economic Survey of India, total employment in the private and public organised sectors of the Indian economy was 7.68 million and 19.06 million, respectively, in 1991; in 2011, the corresponding numbers were 11.42 million and 17.55 million, respectively. Thus, over the last two decades, employment in the modern segment (private + public) has grown at 0.48% per year and in the private sector of the modern segment at 2.13% per year.

Returning, once again, to Table 1, we can now see the full meaning of the numbers: if the labour force and employment in the modern capitalist segment in India continues to grow at the currently observed long run rates of 1.69% and 0.48%, respectively, then the Indian economy will be unable to complete its structural transformation even in 5,000 years. If the labour force grows at the observed rate of 1.69% per year, and the modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for the private capitalist sector, i.e. 2.13% per year, then the Indian economy will complete its structural transformation in 357 years.

If the labour force stops growing altogether while the aggregate modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for only the private capitalist sector, i.e. at 2.13% per year, both of which are extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future, even then Indian structural transformation will be completed in 72 years.

These absurdly large numbers should go some way in opening the eyes of those who have been all fired up by India‚Äôs economic performance in the past three decades. In substantive terms, these numbers convey the simple fact that without radical changes in policy orientation and the institutional setup, economic problems relating to the vast majority of the working population in India is here to stay for a long, long time.

"Budget 2020: India's Youth Want Jobs, Not Another Speech","In 2019, India got two budgets, thanks to the general elections. Expectations were high, especially from the July budget, on taking urgent steps to address the alarming slide in economic growth. However, the document proved to be a self-destructing exercise. Several key decisions announced were either scaled back, watered down or just couldn‚Äôt get going.

But the burning question remains, for a country with a sizeable young population more than 600 million: What do the youth want from the Budget? And the answer is simple. Nothing. The youth want and need jobs.

An estimated 5 million people graduate out of college every year. More often than not, these young adults have neither a strong academic base, nor any special skills that make them immediately employable. So, armed with what should be a strong educational qualification, many are confined to jobs that are low on skill but offer the comfort of a fixed salary.

What is new and unnerving now is the overwhelming numbers of young people looking for employment on account of the changing demographics of the country. CMIE‚Äôs data indicates that in a state like Uttar Pradesh for instance, unemployment doubled from 5.91% in 2018 to 9.95% in 2019. Countrywide, graduates face a 17% unemployment rate.

There‚Äôs another, grimmer side to the story. Those who claim the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests are a one-off instance of youth activism are getting the signs completely wrong. While the context of the protests may be different, this outpouring is a culmination of issues, not a standalone event.

It started with vehement protests against fee hikes in JNU and other places. JNU has been protesting a 300% fee hike. Earlier in November, IIT Bombay and IIT-BHU protested against a 900% fee hike. Similar stories emerged from FTII and IIMC.

A direct rub-off

Many have criticised what they see as an entitled attitude by these young students. What may actually be taking place is a direct rub-off of the stories these aspiring job seekers saw and heard from their homes and towns.

As per the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, the average monthly spending by an individual fell to Rs 1,446 in 2017-18 from Rs 1,501 in 2011-12, down 3.7%. It‚Äôs worse when you slice that for the rural-urban split. A Nomura report points out that rural households saw wage growth slip to a four-quarter low of 4% in 2019.

In a situation where households struggle to find enough to pay for basic supplies, education ‚Äì and the fees required to get it ‚Äì becomes both unattainable and unimportant.

Also Read: Facing the Reality: How Can Modi Reverse the Current Economic Slowdown?

The embers of student protest have become a full-fledged fire, as young students facing the possibility of low to no jobs find that their government wasn‚Äôt even paying lip service to the need for creating employment opportunities but instead were raising a completely different and to many, irrelevant issue.

Another standard deflection tool

In her maiden budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that the government is enabling millions to take up industry-relevant skill training and boosting their job prospects via the ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô initiative.

Here‚Äôs what the numbers say. An analysis of the unit-level data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 shows only a small section of the youth reported receiving any vocational training. Nationally, only 1.8% of the population reported receiving formal vocational or technical training, while 5.6% reported receiving informal vocational training like self-learning. This means 93% of the population received no training, from either formal or informal sources.

Bear in mind, the youth comprised more than half of the people who received formal vocational or technical training.

The data also shows that a large share of them were either unemployed or out of the labour force. Ironically, 42% of the youth who did receive any formal technical training were not part of the labour force at all. And it goes without saying, across age groups, substantial shares of women who received such training were out of the labour force. The training itself was starkly different for men and women.

No skilling, no jobs and not enough disposable income to access either private skilling or education. India‚Äôs youth are angry. And now they are impatient.

So, while the Budget may be held up to question on many parameters ‚Äî fiscal health, poor revenues and kickstarting manufacturing ‚Äî for me the barometer is this: At the start of this decade, India needed 100 million jobs to meet its employment demands. As we step into 2020, India is facing the worst unemployment rate in over four decades. India‚Äôs youth want jobs. They want and deserve to feel secure about their living environment, about their educational institutes and about their economic prospects. Not another Budget speech.",https://thewire.in/economy/budget-2020-youth-jobs,
India‚Äôs Politics and Economics Reflect a Simmering Crisis of Confidence and Mistrust,"The last few weeks have caused a few ripples in India‚Äôs political and economic landscape, reflecting the various shades of problems that our governance system is currently facing.

From the economic point of view, the government, acknowledging a state of crisis, announced yet another set of sector-specific measures. This time it was a Rs 10,000 crore relief package in the form of a ‚Äòspecial window fund‚Äô to revive India‚Äôs real estate industry, one of the worst affected sectors by the current slowdown.

There is little doubt that the real estate sector, which was once responsible for creating a massive number of jobs, is now witnessing an enduring liquidity-crunch. Some of this is likely due to the shock delivered by demonetisation. Nevertheless, the liquidity crunch has seriously impacted job creation in the construction sector, especially in the segments of residential and affordable housing.

The real estate‚Äôs poor performance over the past few years has also added to the deteriorating asset quality of India‚Äôs NBFCs, which has exacerbated the NPA problem. At the same time, due to a fall in demand for mid-income and affordable housing, credit demand for loans by property investors also dropped, resulting in a twin balance sheet problem for the banks.

A worsening bank crisis, evident in the collapse of IL&FS and PMC, has to some extent sparked fear amongst people who occupy the low and middle-income categories. This, in turn, brings down deposit holdings and limits the banking system‚Äôs credit creation powers.

With banks affected by a crisis of confidence, a problem that will involve some recovery time, it remains unclear how effective a supply-side measure like a special window fund can do to revive the real estate sector completely on its own. Especially considering this special measure is, by one estimate, likely to help less than 10% of the country‚Äôs stalled real estate projects. A wholesome, full-time solution requires a more constant credit-channel from India‚Äôs banks.

On the political side, in Maharashtra, we are seeing the Shiv Sena-BJP pre-poll alliance in almost on the verge of collapse. While the former was exploring an alternative political combination i.e. with NCP and Congress, to form a state government, president‚Äôs rule was imposed in the state. In Haryana too, the BJP‚Äôs vote share, to its own surprise, significantly declined due to the lacklustre economic conditions ‚Äì massive job loss and agrarian distress ‚Äì in the state.

The Ayodhya judgment

Amidst all these scenarios came the long overdue Ayodhya judgment by the Supreme Court which settled the 2.77 acre disputed land title case in favor of Ram Lalla and the Hindus to construct a temple there, while granting Muslims a 5 acre land allocated by the UP government for a mosque to be constructed elsewhere.

The judgment, even though decided and announced by India‚Äôs Supreme Court, needs to be viewed as a major ‚Äòpolitical event‚Äô that is principally aligned with the current ruling party‚Äôs vision to have a Ram temple constructed in Ayodhya at all costs. For Hindu fundamentalists, the judgment brings an actualisation of a major historical struggle for establishing religious precedence. It is hard not to see this in the larger context of the apex court announcing this at a time when its own credibility remains in serious doubt (we still haven‚Äôt had one hearing on the constitutionality of the Indian government‚Äôs action in Kashmir).

Also Read: Maharashtra Slips into President‚Äôs Rule Even with Hours Left of NCP‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeadline‚Äô

For now, in terms of its outlined manifesto goals, the BJP has so far emerged successful in achieving two of its three vital national objectives: the dilution of Article 370; having a Ram temple constructed at the disputed site in Ayodhya, with the third goal now, of creating a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), left to fulfil.

In the international scenario, India‚Äôs trade negotiations cohort (led by the prime minister himself), in an eleventh-hour decision, pulled out of joining the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), citing its discontent with the nature of underlying trade agreement that failed to accommodate India‚Äôs principal concerns. This move was observed as a surprise by many commentators, considering how the minister of commerce and other members of the trade negotiators expressed a strong desire for India to be part of the plurilateral trade forum in the months leading up to the official meet in Bangkok.

A common underlying link

But, what seems to be a common underlying link emerging across some of these political and economic events in India‚Äôs recent past?

On a certain level, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta pointed recently, despite ‚Äúthe pantomime optimism‚Äù that the government and the media are trying to display, it is gradually ‚Äúbecoming impossible to disguise the sense of gloom surrounding the Indian economy‚Äù. The growth numbers and estimates at this point reflect exercises of statistical-fudging that mislead facts and fail to represent or forecast an authentic picture for India‚Äôs growth trajectory.

The connecting link, on a deeper level, points towards the fact that we are at a crossroads as with regard to the Indian government‚Äôs ability to lead the nation towards a progressive economic future. The political economic landscape, especially in the last five to six years has institutionalised this crisis of ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô where institutional credibility remains seriously doubted, whether of the RBI or the Supreme Court, as each action seems aligned with the propagandist agenda of the state or guided entirely by political goals rather than democratic or market principles.

A state election (like in Maharashtra) happens with two parties clearly declaring a pre-poll alliance but then parting ways right after the election. This event, of course, isn‚Äôt new in the history of Indian politics. Parties do break up after an election cycle. However, a culture of political inconsistency combined with normalisation of eroding voter-faith is almost becoming a norm, which will have serious impediments on how people vote (or don‚Äôt vote) in elections down the road.

On a larger international plank too, India‚Äôs own position and foreign image, as Ram Guha recently argued, has significantly been damaged post-New Delhi‚Äôs act to downgrade Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs status into two Union Territories and read down Article 370. This damage can be assessed in terms of India‚Äôs weakening democratic credentials ‚Äì a point echoed across US Congressional meetings, its presidential election announcements and in the foreign press.

The last-minute decision to pull out of the RCEP too doesn‚Äôt augur well with India‚Äôs diplomatic and economic policy push towards an Act East outlook. And, without a suitable alternative, this decision warrants a closer assessment in terms of India‚Äôs weakening trade competitiveness levels and diplomatic ability to negotiate agreements based on mutually beneficial market principles (after all this trade negotiation process was on for almost six years).

A crisis of confidence

In the context of the domestic economy too, a crisis of confidence is clear by observing levels of business and investor confidence. In fact, a recent data point indicates how there has been an increase in outward foreign direct investment levels from the private sector at a time when domestic demand remains dismally low along with the consumption demand. A higher outward FDI level in a weak domestic demand scenario simply indicates that the private sector players trust their investment abroad more than they do within India.

There is substantial economic evidence that argues how an atmosphere of systemic mistrust combined with a lack of confidence can adversely impact an economy‚Äôs growth rates by negatively impacting investment levels and business cycles. The logic is simple, as echoed by the Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, who argues: ‚ÄúAn atmosphere generated by a steady flow and variety of lies is like a dark cloud over the facts. Businesses can‚Äôt plan effectively when they don‚Äôt know who or what can be trusted.‚Äù

Also Read: #RightSideUp: Ayodhya, Judgment Day

Mistrust in political functioning or leadership isn‚Äôt only affecting India but even countries like the US. In a recent article for the New York Times, Shiller explains how conditions of a persistent threat to American press amalgamated with the political dangers surfacing from a culture of lying under President Donald Trump, who feels free to attack all press against him as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.

In India‚Äôs political landscape, a deep social polarisation on political action or events is a mirror reflection of this phenomenon. Being on the receiving side on this, I have personally observed a clear pattern of this, emerging from the ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù labelling of anyone with contrarian views or opinions to state-policy. This was even more explicit with all the chatter created right after New Delhi‚Äôs action on Kashmir. Some of the reactions on social media platform presented deeply troubling and resentful views not only against the Kashmiris but against anyone who advocated for the rights of Kashmiris.

Entrenched mistrust

Mistrust is further entrenched in society (and normalised) when the leadership promotes it. An illustration would be to recollect the demonetisation speech by the PM in November of 2016, and how right after, in another speech he passionately remarked: ‚ÄúI have asked the country for just 50 days. If after December 30, there are shortcomings in my work or there are mistakes or a bad intention found in my work, I will be prepared for the punishment that the country decides for me.‚Äù With the shock-move clearly failing and choking India‚Äôs growth engine, there hasn‚Äôt been any apology or official word on this since then.

At the same time, a form of violent verbal attitude ‚Äì shaped by a rhetorical axis of ‚Äòfor or against‚Äô, ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô ‚Äì is seen dividing a citizenry on key social, economic and political issues that have ramifications for the nation as a whole. And this has serious consequences for India‚Äôs own future and its credentials as a large democratic, market economy. It was ‚Äòtrust‚Äô in these very credentials which provided greater clarity and consistency to business communities ‚Äì within and outside India, to invest in India‚Äôs market (as do so in a severely authoritarian regime like China).

Watch | The Wire Business Report | India‚Äôs Job Crisis: Behind the Numbers with Mahesh Vyas

Trust and confidence are factors that are extremely difficult to measure or quantify. They have a social multiplier effect that drives an entire citizenry to work towards collective progress or regress. One needs to closely study and understand this effect: how a rise in mistrust or lack of confidence levels which is multiplying as a social phenomenon across countries like India, the US (to name a few) is affecting the citizenry at large?

There are deeper questions involved here about the political and economic psyche of an average citizen and how vulnerable she can be made when a strong state, as a matter of policy or law, pursues a polarising political agenda.

At the same time, from purely an economic lens, a fragile confidence in a political system will cause economic growth to fall. This is something that we perhaps are already seeing in India.

"9 Million Jobs Lost in 6 Years, a First in Indian History","New Delhi: A recent working paper published by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University has contested official claims on employment, showing an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù fall in total employment from 2011-12 to 2017-18.

Written by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K. Parida, the study says employment dropped by 9 million between these years ‚Äì ‚Äúfor the first time in India‚Äôs history‚Äù.

While these are not new observations, this is perhaps the first such formal study to establish through official data that total employment is declining and a reserve army of unemployed youth (both openly unemployed and disheartened) is rising ‚Äúmassively‚Äù. The study also shows a trend of increasing contractualisation in the both government and private jobs.

Also read: Troubling Unemployment Data, Leaked in January, Now Released Post-Elections

Though the share of regular and formal employment increased marginally overall, most jobs are still being generated by micro and small units of the unorganised and private sectors (68% of the total non-farm employment during 2017-18), the study found. The share of informal jobs has increased in the public sector as well, indicating a lack of decent government jobs.

Sector-wise decline

The agricultural sector registered a decline in employment at the rate of 4.5 million per annum (about 27 million in total) during 2011-12 and 2017-18. The share of employment in the agricultural and allied sector declined from 49 to about 44%.

The labour-intensive manufacturing sector registered a decline of 3.5 million jobs. The share of manufacturing in total employment has thus gone down from 12.6 to 12.1% ‚Äì in fact, manufacturing jobs have fallen for the first time in India‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs not just a decline in growth rate but in absolute numbers too.

The authors note that, ‚Äúfalling manufacturing jobs is the opposite of the goal of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, and the opposite of what is desirable if the process of structural transformation is to be sustained‚Äù.

There‚Äôs a slowdown in construction job growth. Non-manufacturing jobs (mostly construction) which created about 4 million jobs every year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 created only about 0.6 million per annum during 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Also read: NSSO Data Puts Unemployment at 45-Year High in 2017-18: Report

The only sector to witness sustained job growth (3 million per annum) was services. There has been a 17.3 million rise in regular salaried workers in this sector during 2011-12 and 2017-18. However, the quality of jobs in this sector are mostly poor.

The study says:

‚ÄúWhile falling total and youth employment in agriculture is good news from the structural transformation point of view, falling manufacturing employment and decelerating construction employment growth are bad news for the economy, which moved up to lower middle income status just over a decade ago. To sustain the growth of income, improve standard of living, and to reduce poverty, employment opportunities in manufacturing and construction (although a transitory sector) is necessary. Because this would not only sustain the structural transformation process, it would also help sustain growth of GDP over the long run.‚Äù

Speaking to The Wire, Mehrotra said that the number of entrants into the labour force has been increasing since 2011-12, it was very small between 2004-05 and 2011-12 (only 2 million per annum). The number has risen after that in the last six years to roughly 5 million per annum. At the same time, non-agricultural job growth has declined. When these facts are combined, it indicates that there is an increase in the open unemployment rate. The supply of labour is increasing while the demand for it is decreasing.

According to The Indian Express, this result is ‚Äúin stark contrast to the recent study by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey, which was commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister‚Äù. This study had claimed that total employment grew from 433 million in 2011-12 to 457 million in 2017-18.

The latest study by Mehrotra and Parida, however, says that employment fell from 474 million in 2011-12 to 465 million in 2017-18.

A major reason for this difference could be because the estimates for 2004-05 and 2011-12 in the study by Bhandari and Dubey (412 million and 433 million respectively) are much lower than that in Mehrotra and Parida (459 and 474). Mehrotra believes that it‚Äôs almost certainly because they have used only Usual Principal Status (UPS) and not Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS) in their calculations.

Under UPS, a person is considered part of the labour force if s/he works for 183 days or more in a year. Under UPSS, a person who has worked even for 30 days in a year is considered employed.

Also read: The Slowdown is Real and We Need More than Brave Faces and Silly Alibis to Fix Things

However, for the 2017-18 figure, both the studies seem to have used both principal and subsidiary status as the results are very close (457 and 465 respectively).

Real wages, which were increasing from 2004-05 to 2011-12 because of job growth (Mehrotra says 7.5 million new non-agricultural jobs were being created at a time when fewer people were entering the labour force), have stagnated or fell. ‚ÄúWe have gone back to the period of 1996-2004 in terms of real wages, they‚Äôre flat or they‚Äôve fallen,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Though the study only draws inferences from the study as the final conclusion can only be arrived at when the consumer expenditure survey is out. The authors‚Äô inference is that poverty has not declined in the last six years.

Even though the latest official consumption survey is not out yet, Himanshu, associate professor at JNU‚Äôs Centre for Economic Studies and Planning compared two Periodic Labour Force Surveys in 2014-15 and 2017-18 and found that the consumption expenditure of rural and urban Indian households has been falling. ‚ÄúWe know from macro data that private consumption as a proportion of the GDP has actually fallen in the last 6 years, and household savings have fallen very sharply. When you put that together, it is very clear that stagnation in real wages is showing up in declining expenditure and a fall in household savings,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Also read: Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking

The study also shows that there has been some improvement in the share of informal workers in the total workforce ‚Äì it has gone down from 93% to 90.7%. Informal workers are defined as those who have no death and disability insurance and old age pension. The reasons for his decline could be due to factors like the government paying the workers‚Äô share of EPFO contributions for three years and increase in registration of firms due under GST (which could have encouraged EPFO registration as well).

Within the organised sector, however, there is an interesting paradox ‚Äì the share of those who have social security has increased in the organised sector, reversing an erstwhile trend, but the number of workers with short term contracts has also gone up.

In conclusion, the authors suggest a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy ‚Äúto address agrarian transformation, boost real wages in rural areas, ensure industrial development, taking skill issues into consideration‚Äù.",https://thewire.in/labour/9-million-jobs-lost-in-6-years-a-first-in-indian-history,
"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

He added that after assurances from the DC Srinagar, they have submitted proposals to him for helping the company get new clients. ‚ÄúWe are very hopeful that we will get business for the company. I am personally working with Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and we are discussing how to solve this issue. So far we have conducted several meetings with him in the presence of other officials. We are hopeful that we will get more business, so that no one will lose their jobs.‚Äù

According to Nissar, when they started this unit, the site‚Äôs infrastructure and setup was poor. They have changed that over the years and now business was doing well. ‚ÄúThis office is like my child. I have a very personal attachment to it and in all these years, we all have worked so hard that I cannot see it in this phase.‚Äù

However, employees working with the company are not seeing anything happen. ‚ÄúWe have been waiting for weeks. Like many promises from the government, we don‚Äôt think this will come true for us,‚Äù said an employee who was standing at the AEGIS gate to meet his colleague.

The ongoing clampdown has hit businesses across sectors. Tourism, which is considered to be the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs economy, is going through its one of its worst phases yet.

Finding no income in the last 64 days, hotel and houseboat owners have laid off their staffers. There are more than 1,200 houseboats registered in Srinagar, and each houseboat had two helpers. Now, 90% of the workers on these houseboats have lost their jobs.

‚ÄúI used to work on the HB Fairy houseboat. With no work left there, my employer told me to go home. I have small children back at home and it is becoming difficult for me to feed them. Yanhan gunda gardi chalti hai, jo mann main aata hai, karte hain. Bhugta kaun hai, hum jaise gareeb (There is authoritarianism here. Whatever they want for themselves, they do that. It is the poor people like me who become victims of such decisions),‚Äù said 33-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Bhat from Srinagar‚Äôs Buchwara, on the Dal Lake.

The most common worry is how to manage daily expenses. A worker standing next to Bhat said, ‚ÄúDo they have any idea of the problems facing a common man here? No. If that would have been the case, they would not have chosen this. We have families, small children. I don‚Äôt have money even to buy diapers for my son.‚Äù

Unofficial lay offs

People like Bhat and Tariq know that their jobs are gone, and have very little hope of getting them back. But others, who work for private firms, are still unsure of what the future holds for them. Employees of one of the most renowned private automobile outlets, Jamkash Vehicles which deals in Maruti cars, are now feeling the heat. The dealership has 1,400 employees in six different outlets across the Valley.

Employees‚Äô attendance has not been maintained for the last month in Jamkash Vehicles‚Äô main branch in Hyderpora, Srinagar. ‚ÄúThere are chances that they will reduce nearly 50% of their staff if the situation does not improve. Although they have not given us any official notification, it is certain,‚Äù said a senior employee, wishing not to be named.

Having worked for the company for more than 14 years, he told The Wire that if the company does, it is only the workers who will be in trouble. ‚ÄúThere is huge unemployment here and when normalcy returns, the company will hire new workers. It is not a big deal for them. Their main concern is business ‚Äì if you are providing them that, you are safe. If you failed to do it, you will be shown the door.‚Äù

According to an employee working with Rising Kashmir, a Srinagar-based daily, the newspaper has also laid off staff members. ‚ÄúRabiya Bashir, Ishfaq Amin, Sahil Iqbal and Ishfaq Ahmad were told to stop work. Facing a financial crisis in this continuous clampdown, the organisation was not able to pay them. It‚Äôs a sad decision but what are the options? I am feeling bad for them.‚Äù

A journalist at Greater Kashmir, wishing not to be named, told The Wire that they have been told by the HR that the organisation has decided on a new policy for its employees: ‚ÄúNo work, no pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, since this is communication blockade, many district reporters were not able to send their stories. This decision has mostly hit district reporters who are working on meagre salaries,‚Äù he said.

With no improvement in the circumstances in sight, many weekly news magazines and online portals in the Valley are facing tremendous losses on a daily basis. An owner of the online news portal, requesting anonymity, told The Wire, ‚ÄúSince August 5, we are not able to publish a single story.

"On Manmohan Singh's Birthday, Congress Renews Unemployment Charge Against BJP Govt","New Delhi: The Congress on Thursday harnessed the occasion of former prime minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs birthday to highlight rising unemployment and falling education levels in India.

Since morning, the party‚Äôs social media handles were rife with multiple tributes to Singh. Its national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, meanwhile, addressed the press to present the recently-released economic and higher education indicators that would reportedly substantiate the claim that the BJP-led Union government has left the country in a poor state.

Surjewala quoted figures from two reports: the 8th Annual All India Survey on Higher Education, 2018-19 released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), and the Unemployment in India: A Statistical Profile released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

Unemployment

The Congress leader said that at 8.19% in August, 2019, the unemployment rate in India in perhaps the highest since Independence. The August figure shows further deterioration from 7.03% in May 2019, which it was itself the highest in the last 50 years.

Surjewala also pointed out that the figures are much higher than the global average of 4.95% declared by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

The current global average unemployment rate is 4.95% & as per the latest CMIE report India‚Äôs unemployment rate is nearly double that amount at 7.46%. And the BJP govt. still claims we‚Äôre the fast growing economy in the world. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/JWK3pl0lM5 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

He also pointed out at the gender break up of the problem. ‚ÄúWhile the unemployment rate among men is 6%, it is 17.5% among women. This is the reality of the union government‚Äôs Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao mission.‚Äù

The rate of unemployment for men is 6.1% while that among women is more than double i.e. 17.5%. This is the reality of the ‚ÄòBeti Bachao Beti Padhao‚Äô Govt: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/Vd2FCdHkL6 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Both rural & urban unemployment have risen in the last four months but in all the ‚Äúbudgets‚Äù presented our FM @nsitharaman there is no policy to address the growing unemployment crisis. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/XH6PJ0oXrk ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Another staggering conclusion the CMIE report highlights, Surjewala said, is that the current unemployment rate is almost three times higher than the global average among those who are graduates or more. Almost 15% of those highly-educated people who are actively looking for a job are unable to find one.

‚ÄúThe report says that more than one young people are without a job now. In reality, however, the number may be much more,‚Äù said the Congress leader.

Unemployment level jumps to 15% among those who are graduates and above. This is three times the international average. Currently more than one crore youth are unemployed: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/70hbYS3kg8 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019



Education

The MHRD report, the Congress leader said, throws up even more troubling statistics.

‚ÄúThe government in its own report admits that 74% among the youth, between 18 and 23 years, are not enrolled in colleges at the moment.

‚ÄúOnly 2.5% colleges in India are admitting students in PhD programmes. As many as 35% of the total colleges have only one single programme. And to top it all, 83% of the total number of colleges in India are privately managed. What has happened to the responsibility of the government which claimed to provide world-class education to all?‚Äù Surjewala asked.

Also read: A Simmering Unemployment Crisis in India

He added that only 8.5% of the total number of teachers are from Scheduled Caste communities, which means that even the minimum guaranteed reservation system is not being implemented properly.

‚ÄúBJP and the present government has turned India‚Äôs demographic dividend into a demographic disaster because of their disastrous policies. A government that continues to say ‚Äòeverything is fine‚Äô should think a little more,‚Äù he said, adding that it is ‚Äútime for the prime minister to look beyond stage-managed programmes.‚Äù

He said that the prime minister should now start addressing the most pertinent question the youth of India is asking, that is ‚ÄúHowdy, Education, Howdy, Unemployment‚Äù.

He also said that in the 10 years the UPA was in the government, the unemployment rate had never shot up like this.

Earlier in the day, Congress took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While posting a video on Manmohan Singh, it described him as ‚Äúthe leader other leaders love‚Äù.

Sonia Gandhi, the party‚Äôs interim president, also wished the former prime minister on his birthday, recalled his contributions, and said, ‚ÄúPresent day rulers across the spectrum have much to learn from his innate wisdom.‚Äù",https://thewire.in/education/on-manmohan-singhs-birthday-congress-renews-unemployment-charge-against-bjp-govt,
North India's Unemployment Woes Due to Lack of Qualified Candidates: Labour Minister,"New Delhi: Union labour minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar stirred controversy on Sunday after indicating that the employment crisis in North Indian states was not due to a lack of jobs, but that recruiting companies could not find enough qualified candidates.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments attracted criticism from opposition politicians but also shine an unflattering spotlight on the Skill India project, a massive initiative that comes under the skill development ministry and works closely with the labour ministry.

Over the past four years, both supporters and critics of the Centre have pointed out flaws in the flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), which was supposed to align the capabilities of India‚Äôs youth to the requirements of India Inc.

‚ÄúThe issue of employment keep figuring in newspapers these days. I am handling the same ministry for labour and employment and examine the issue daily. I have understood the problem,‚Äù Gangwar told reporters on Saturday in Bareilly, his Lok Sabha constituency.

‚ÄúRecruiters who visit north India complain of facing dearth of quality people for the posts they need to fill,‚Äù he added.

According to the latest India Skill Report (2019), which is backed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), only a little over of 45% of youth graduating from educational institutions are employable.

Earlier this year, data released by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) also indicated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate may have been the highest in over 40 years at 6.1% in 2017-18.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments, therefore, come as salt in the wound for a festering problem. In October 2018, The Wire had reported of top level exits at the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a problem that indicated not all is well with Skill India.

The minister‚Äôs remarks drew sharp reactions from opposition with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra saying the government was trying to escape blame for the job losses due to economic slowdown by such ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù comments.

‚ÄúMr Minister, it has been more than five years for your government. There is no job creation. Whatever jobs were there, they have been snatched due to the economic slowdown brought by the government. You want to escape by insulting North Indians,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYouths are looking towards the government hoping that it will do something good for them,‚Äù the Congress general secretary said.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said such comments are laughable.

‚ÄúAfter the different laughable statements by different Union ministers on the serious issue of economic slowdown, instead of removing unemployment in the country now it is being said that there is no shortage of jobs, but of competence, especially amongst north Indians.

‚ÄúThis is extremely shameful and an apology should be tendered to the nation,‚Äù she tweeted.

Clarification?

In an apparent clarification made to news agency ANI, Gangwar, who is a minister of state with independent charge, said that he was trying to paint a different context.

There was a lack of skill and the government has opened a skill ministry so children can be trained as per the job requirement, he said.

"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

The troubles that started with defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) last year are far from over, as the sector continues to face a severe liquidity crisis. If tight liquidity conditions persist in the next financial year, it may turn into a solvency issue for several shadow banks.

After the IL&FS collapse, the entire sector is facing a crisis of confidence. Investors are shying away from investing in securities issued by shadow banks. Several shadow banks are finding it difficult to raise money from banks, mutual funds and the rest of the financial system for either funding their growth or rollover of existing short-term debt. Some are resorting to asset monetisation to meet their immediate repayment obligations.

Leave aside those shadow banks that have weak financial profiles; even financially sound and better-governed entities are facing a liquidity squeeze. Most shadow banks have reduced disbursement of loans to preserve liquidity.

After growing aggressively in the last three years, the credit disbursals by shadow banks have fallen by almost a third this year. Consequently, lending to housing, automobile, consumer durables and small businesses has substantially reduced. In sectors such as housing and automobile, shadow banks play a vital role in loan financing. The reduced availability of funding has contributed to the slowdown in these sectors.

In particular, the automobile sector has been badly hit by the ongoing liquidity crisis as shadow banks were the leading financiers of commercial vehicles, passenger cars and two-wheelers in India. Before the onset of the liquidity crisis, close to 40% of new auto loans were issued by shadow banks. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, passenger car sales declined by 26% in April-July 2019 over the same period last year. Close to 300 dealer showrooms of passenger vehicles have shut down across India in the last one year as shadow banks have stopped financing vehicle purchase, while automakers have either cut production or shut production plants temporarily to keep inventory in check. Analysts estimate that tens of thousands of jobs in India‚Äôs auto sector are at risk if the slump in the automobile sector continues.

Since commercial banks are still struggling with high levels of non-performing assets, they are not rushing in to fill the void left by the shadow banks. Rather, commercial banks may also like to reduce their exposure to stressed sectors such as automobile and housing to improve their balance sheets. All these developments in the financial sector will have serious ramifications on the overall economy as the bulk of India‚Äôs economic growth is driven by domestic demand.

DHFL: The new poster boy of the liquidity crisis

Since September 2018, hardly a week passes without more bad news about the cash-strapped Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). On August 16, DHFL again defaulted on its repayment obligations worth Rs 15.7 billion on non-convertible debentures and commercial papers. Nothing new as the company has not been able to meet most of its debt repayment obligations since June 2019, but this was the largest default by the DHFL till date.

DHFL has a total debt liability of Rs 850 billion as of June 2019, out of which secured loans stood at Rs 749 billion while the rest is unsecured. The company posted a net loss of Rs 22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018-2019.

The company‚Äôs lending business has virtually come to a standstill, with no fresh disbursements of loans in the last six months. The series of defaults have made it almost impossible for the company to raise new money from the financial markets.

In July, while announcing the fourth-quarter financial results, the company admitted that it is ‚Äúundergoing substantial financial stress‚Äù and its ability to raise funds was ‚Äúsubstantially impaired and the business has been brought to a standstill with there being minimal/virtually no disbursements‚Ä¶ These developments may raise a significant doubt on the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.‚Äù

Of late, DHFL sold its stake in non-core businesses to meet some of its repayment obligations, but it has not been able to find suitable buyers for a majority equity stake in the company. So far, investors have only shown interest in buying portions of its asset portfolio.

Earlier this month, the company approached the consortium of lenders with a resolution plan that includes conversion of debt to equity, a moratorium on repayments, and new credit lines to start fresh lending. The bankers are now discussing the resolution plan. Currently, the Wadhawan family controls DHFL, with a 39.21% stake in the company. If the lenders accept the resolution plan, they may also demand to replace the company‚Äôs management because in January, online news portal CobraPost raised allegations that DHFL created shell companies to divert funds worth Rs 31 billion.

After the IL&FS collapse, DHFL is the second large-sized shadow bank on the verge of bankruptcy. With so much public money at stake, banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies are all keen to avoid bankruptcy at DHFL.

A belated regulatory response

In the past two months, several regulatory measures have been announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India. Some of the regulatory measures were long overdue. For instance, returning the regulatory authority over the housing finance sector from National Housing Bank to the RBI is a welcome move, provided the staff strength of RBI is suitably increased to undertake both onsite inspections and off-site surveillance of housing finance companies that constitute a major segment of India‚Äôs shadow banking sector.

Another notable development is that the RBI is now empowered to remove any director and supersede the board of directors of shadow banks ‚Äúin the public interest or to prevent the affairs of a nonbanking financial company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors or creditors, or financial stability or for securing the proper management of such company.‚Äù

Besides, the RBI has been given powers to remove or debar auditors if they fail to conduct their role correctly. The financial penalties are also enhanced if the shadow banks don‚Äôt implement the regulatory measures.

The RBI has recently cancelled registrations of 1,851 shadow banks that could not raise even Rs 20 million to meet the minimum regulatory requirements. One wonders why such entities were permitted to run a shadow bank in the first place?

What about carrots?

Both the finance ministry and the RBI have announced several policy measures to ease liquidity pressure in the shadow banking sector. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen. These include an increase in any bank‚Äôs single-exposure limit to a single shadow bank from the existing 15% to 20% of tier-1 capital; priority sector lending status for credit to shadow banks for on-lending to agriculture, SMEs and housing; and reduced risk-weights for consumer loans.

In her Union Budget speech on July 5, the finance minister provided a one-time six months‚Äô partial credit guarantee to public sector banks for the first loss of up to 10% to purchase high-rated pooled assets from financially sound shadow banks amounting to Rs 1 trillion. It is too early to assess the impact of this measure as its operational guidelines have been issued on August 13, but the fact remains that this one-time facility is only meant for ‚Äúfinancially sound‚Äù shadow banks. In other words, the least risky shadow banks (such as HDFC and LIC Housing Finance) will benefit from this facility, not the cash-starved weaker entities such as DHFL and Reliance Capital.

On August 23, Nirmala Sitharaman announced additional liquidity support of Rs 200 billion to housing finance companies to be provided by the National Housing Bank, as part of a stimulus package. The minister also announced that public sector banks (PSBs) would fast track collaborations with shadow banks for loans to SMEs, small traders and microfinance institutions under the co-origination scheme introduced in last August by the RBI. Under this scheme, shadow banks will take a minimum of 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure while the co-originating PSB will take the rest of the credit risk.

This scheme allows shadow banks to expand their business and thereby book profits with little investments while the PSBs can meet their priority sector targets of lending to such sectors, albeit with higher credit risks. At the time of writing, there is no information available about the volume of loans disbursed under the co-origination scheme. As there are better and safer options available to the PSBs to achieve priority sector lending targets, they may not be willing to collaborate with ailing shadow banks unless they are forced to do so by New Delhi.

More importantly, it raises a pertinent question: why encourage public sector banks to increase lending to shadow banks? And particularly at a time when the capital-constrained PSBs already have considerable exposure to troubled shadow banks (such as DHFL and Reliance Capital) and are currently struggling to repair their balance sheets from the NPA crisis? Such policy moves would make public sector banks more vulnerable as the potential risks in the shadow banks will spillover to banks. PSBs account for nearly 70% of India‚Äôs banking sector and therefore raise potential financial stability concerns.

Rather, the strategy should be to ring-fence the current liquidity crisis in the shadow banking sector and thereby prevent the problems spilling over into the Indian banking sector.

In China and elsewhere, the authorities are trying to break the interlinkages between the shadow banks and banks to ensure the contagion risks arising out of a failure of large shadow banks in the banking sector are contained, and overall financial stability is preserved.

To restore the investors‚Äô confidence, the RBI should undertake the asset quality review of India‚Äôs shadow banks to bring all problems to the fore, similar to what the RBI conducted for commercial banks in 2015.

An inherent problem with the business model of shadow banks is their over-reliance on short-term funding to fund longer-term assets. To finance infrastructure and long-term industrial projects, New Delhi should set up specialised development finance institutions with explicit public policy mandates and higher standards of transparency and accountability.

"Ground Report | In Leh, Celebrations Give Way to Concerns over Land and Job Protections","Leh: On the eve of India‚Äôs 73rd Independence Day, and almost ten days after the announcement that Ladakh will be separated from Kashmir to become a union territory and the state‚Äôs special status will be removed, an air of jubilation hung in the picturesque town of Leh in one of the country‚Äôs most sparsely populated districts ‚Äì Ladakh.

A group of youngsters gathered at the main market in Leh to put up a banner reading ‚ÄòUnion Territory of Ladakh celebrates its 1st Independence Day‚Äô. All of them preferred anonymity. ‚ÄúIndependence from Kashmir,‚Äù explained one of them. ‚ÄúFor too long, we have been neglected by leaders from Kashmir who have only focused on the Valley.‚Äù

The next morning, as the flag hoisting ceremony was about to begin in Leh‚Äôs Polo Ground, patriotic songs from Hindi films blared from industrial-strength speakers. Each song was followed by cries of ‚ÄòBharat Mata ki Jai‚Äô and ‚ÄòJai Hind‚Äô from the master of ceremonies and the ever-increasing crowd.

‚ÄúIt is a very happy moment for us. It is a dream come true,‚Äù said Tsering Namdan, who was looking forward to the Independence Day ceremony and was particularly excited to catch a glimpse of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of the Indian cricket team, who, rumour went, would be present for the flag hoisting ceremony as part of his 15-day deployment with the territorial army.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding UT (union territory) status for 70 years and are very thankful to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah that they have fulfilled our demand. Now, we can look forward to fast-paced development,‚Äù Namdan said.

The demand for union territory status in Ladakh dates back to 1949. ‚ÄúWe have always held that we want to be separated from Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù P.T. Kunzang, president of the influential Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) told The Wire. ‚ÄúOur identity, culture, geography, way of life and food is different from J&K. That is why we wanted that Ladakh be separated and administered by the Centre.‚Äù

At the Independence Day ceremony, 19-year-old Tenzin Minkey stood with her fists tightly clenched as she watched columns of police personnel and school kids march to the military marching beat. As the columns would pass the Indian flag and offer a salute, Minkey would raise her fist and offer her cry of allegiance, ‚ÄúBharat Mata ki Jai!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have always been proud Indians. Today, we are free from the clutches of Kashmir that held us back for 70 years, and I am extremely happy. We had nothing to do with the conflict but our schools and colleges would also be shut when the situation would get tense in the Valley. We were made to learn Urdu, even when nobody here speaks Urdu,‚Äù she said.

Her father, Tenzin, was a little more circumspect. ‚ÄúThere is great enthusiasm right now, especially among the youth. However, the fact is that there is a lot of uncertainty. Protections on land and reservation of jobs are also gone now. That could create issues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToday, you are seeing an initial euphoria. But this will change in a few days.‚Äù

Concerns of the tribal population

Two days after breaking into a dance during the Independence Day celebrations, BJP‚Äôs member of parliament from Ladakh, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, appeared a little more subdued and circumspect. ‚ÄúAfter the Centre announced its decision to make Ladakh a union territory, the biggest concern of the tribal population here is to protect their identity, culture, land and economy,‚Äù he said while speaking at the launch of a national tribal festival in Leh in the presence of the Union minister of tribal affairs, Arjun Munda.

He also handed a letter to Munda outlining the vulnerability of Ladakh‚Äôs 98% tribal population owing to its ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô land-based economy, limited means of livelihood, undeveloped markets, harsh climate, close proximity to China and Pakistan borders, presence of Indian army and paramilitary forces and a fragile ecology under threat of climate change.

Namgyal urged Munda to declare Ladakh a tribal area under Article 244 ‚Äì which deals with the administration of scheduled and tribal areas ‚Äì and bring the new union territory under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution, which currently grants a degree of autonomy to four states in the Northeast.

Demands for autonomy

The demand is echoed by many leaders in the Leh district, including Kunzang, the president of LBA. He argued that now that the protections on land use and reservation of jobs no longer exist, there are a lot of ‚Äòapprehensions‚Äô and ‚Äòuncertainties. ‚ÄúThere need to be protections either under Article 371 or under Schedule 6 so that land and jobs are protected,‚Äù Kunzang said, predicting that in the absence of these protections, the people of Ladakh will suffer.

Due to the district being sparsely populated, he likened the people of Ladakh to tigers. ‚ÄúOur population is only about three lakhs. If people from all over the country start buying land and settling here, then we will be marginalised. Our culture will be lost. We need to be protected the way tigers are protected.‚Äù

Concerns over the loss of Ladakh‚Äôs unique culture and identity are now growing. ‚ÄúOurs is a very different culture from the rest of India, and if people from outside start settling here, that culture will be threatened. It will die,‚Äù said Tsewang Rigzen, who owns a small grocery store near Leh‚Äôs main market.

Tsering Morup, who stood outside the store, said that for this reason, it is crucial that Ladakh be brought under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution. ‚ÄúPeople in other Indian states are wealthier than people here. If they start buying land here, there will be nothing left for us.‚Äù

According to the constitutional expert and vice-chancellor of the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Faizan Mustafa, bringing Ladakh under Schedule 6 will grant it the kind of autonomy that it already had, as part of J&K, under Article 370. ‚ÄúAutonomy under Schedule 6 almost resembles the autonomy under the diluted Article 370 ‚Äì diluted by presidential orders over the years,‚Äù Mustafa told The Wire.

Since 1954, by a series of presidential orders, the Indian state extended 260 of its 395 Articles, 94 of the 97 entries in the union list, 26 of the 47 items in the concurrent list and seven of the 12 schedules to the state of J&K, thereby diluting its autonomy under Article 370.

‚ÄúLook, the reality is that we never demanded that Article 370 be revoked. We are not fools. We need those protections. But the government had to do it this way because their focus is the Valley and they can‚Äôt be seen to be going easy on them,‚Äù said a local leader who declined to be named. ‚ÄúSoon you will see that demands for autonomy, protection over land and jobs and a legislature will increase in Ladakh and the Centre will have to grant them.‚Äù

Not getting legislature a ‚Äòletdown‚Äô

The demand for union territory status has included the demand for a legislature with it, and the grant of former without the latter has caused disappointment. ‚ÄúWhile we are very happy that UT status has been granted, but not getting a legislature is a letdown. All political parties, social and religious organisations have always demanded UT status with the legislature,‚Äù said senior Congress leader and former minister in the J&K government, Rigzin Jora.

Kunzang agreed with Jora. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs disappointing to not get a legislature. That was our demand. But I am hopeful that the hill council will be granted legislative powers,‚Äù Kunzang said.

Hill councils

Leh and Kargil, the two districts in the newly-carved union territory of Ladakh, have retained their autonomous hill development councils, which came into existence in 1995 and 2003 respectively. Both have 30 councillors of which 26 are elected and four are nominated by the government of J&K. It is not yet clear who will nominate the members under the new arrangement.

The councils have powers to collect local taxes, regulate land use, prioritise the implementation of schemes, formulate budgets and others, making them among the most autonomous councils in India. Now, local leaders are hoping the councils will be empowered to legislate, granting the UT of Ladakh a degree of control over its laws.

As things stand, the councils can regulate the sale and purchase of state-owned land, but not private land, and that is a cause for worry. ‚ÄúSee, the land is an emotive issue here. We have a deep connect with the land and our economy too is dependent on it. So, it‚Äôs a big concern. Even with the hill councils, an individual can sell their own piece of land,‚Äù said Jora.

He argued that Ladakh turning into ‚Äòanother Manali or Shimla‚Äô will not be desirable. ‚ÄúIn Manali and Shimla, properties are owned by people from Mumbai, Gujarat. Locals are waiters and bartenders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want our boys and girls to become waiters and bartenders.‚Äù

Mehboob Ali, who owns three hotels in Leh, agrees with Jora. ‚ÄúAlthough, we are happy with the UT status, there are some worries also. If big hotel chains come here, then they will take over our land, our hotels. We will have to work under them. We want development, but on our own terms,‚Äù Ali said.

Fear of loss of jobs

The youth in Ladakh would prefer if the Centre provide a form of reservation of jobs. Tashi Namgyal, a second-year student of Bachelor of Arts at the government degree college in Leh, explained that reservations are needed because Leh lacks the kind of education facilities and infrastructure that exist in other parts of India.

‚ÄúIt will be difficult for us to compete with them. We have only one degree college and that also does not have any specialised courses. People from outside will come with specialisations,‚Äù Namgyal said.

Rigzin, who recently completed her BA, raised apprehensions over the loss of job opportunities, ‚ÄúThere are very few job opportunities as it is. If more people will settle in Ladakh, then that problem is going to increase further.‚Äù

Concerns over ecology

Namgyal also said that the fragile ecology of Ladakh has its limits, particularly with the impacts of climate change increasingly being felt, ‚ÄúAlready, we are seeing that we have less snow and more rain. On top of that, there is the issue of plastic and solid waste which will become more serious if more people start living here.‚Äù

According to Tsewang Dolma, who heads the Ladakh Ecological Development and Environmental Group, an NGO that promotes ecological and sustainable development in Ladakh, Leh is already overburdened as it plays host to around three lakh tourists every year ‚Äì twice the population of Leh district. ‚ÄúThere are no facilities for plastic waste treatment and barely anything for treatment of faecal waste,‚Äù she said.

To add to the growing woes, Dolma said, a water crisis looms in the cold desert every summer. ‚ÄúAlmost every household in Leh either has a homestay or a hotel. And with the number of tourists that we get, there is a huge water crisis.‚Äù

She suggests that new tourist spots be developed, a cap be fixed for the number of tourists and a tax be levied. ‚ÄúWe have to reduce the burden on Leh. The government can develop other tourist spots. It is also important to limit the number of tourists to say, 2,00,000, every year and charge an environment fee like Bhutan has done,‚Äù she said.

Otherwise, according to Dolma, the comparison, dreaded in these parts, will have to be made. ‚ÄúWe need safeguards, otherwise it will not take long for Leh to turn into another Manali or Shimla,‚Äù Dolma said.

Kunzang is hopeful that all the concerns will be taken care of before October 31, when the division of J&K takes effect. ‚ÄúWe have some time. We are forming committees which will look at each and every issue and negotiate with the government. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the issues,‚Äù he said.

A divided UT

As the new union territory of Ladakh heads towards an uncertain future, it also stands divided. As previously reported by The Wire, Kargil ‚Äì the other district which will form the new union territory ‚Äì has seen widespread protests and shutdowns since August 5, when the drastic steps were announced.

While the people of Kargil and Leh have broadly similar worries over the protection of land and reservation of jobs, their views differ on the bifurcation of the state. While Leh has since 1949 demanded that it be separated from J&K and administered by the Centre, Kargil has never stood by that demand, citing its close ties with the Kashmir Valley and aversion to further division of the state.

In the week after the decision to bifurcate the state was announced, the two districts saw very different reactions. Leh rejoiced, with fervent gusto initially and with some caution as time wore on. Kargil, on the other hand, has protested with the kind of intensity that has rarely been seen.

This has prompted the LBA to write to home minister Amit Shah to seek the protection of Buddhists in Kargil, who form 15% of the population in the Muslim-majority district. The organisation has claimed that there has been an attempt to ‚Äúinfuse communal hatred among the people of Kargil against the Buddhist community and there was an immediate need to ensure the safety and security of Buddhists living in Kargil district.‚Äù

Leaders of the joint action committee in Kargil have said that these worries are unfounded. ‚ÄúThere is no truth to this. It is an attempt by the LBA to dilute our struggle. Buddhists in Kargil have always lived without any fear and will continue to do so,‚Äù said Asgar Ali Karbalai, a former Congress MLA from Kargil and now a key member of the JAC.

He also stressed that the agitation in Kargil will continue. ‚ÄúSo far the government has not responded positively. So our agitation will only pick up now. We are against the division of the state and want to continue to be with J&K with our protection over land and jobs restored,‚Äù Karbalai said.

Goldman Sachs Sees More Pain in Store for the Indian Economy,"New Delhi: Analysts at Goldman Sachs see more pain in store for the Indian economy over the next few months despite the government‚Äôs stimulus unveiled last week. In their recent co-authored report titled India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown, Andrew Tilton, their chief Asia-Pacific economist expects this slowdown to last at least a couple of quarters more.

‚ÄúWeak global macroeconomic conditions, and a negative fiscal impulse are assumed to be a drag on economic activity. The risks to our outlook for economic activity for FY20 continue to be tilted to the downside, given the continued weakness in consumption indicators, and persistent confidence concerns emanating from NBFCs that the Goldman Sachs India Financials equity analysts have pointed out,‚Äù wrote Tilton in a co-authored report with Prachi Mishra and Sakshi Goenka.

Also Read: For India Inc‚Äôs Sob Story, Sitharaman Has a Sop Story. But Will It Help?

The economic slowdown, they said, started in January 2018 and that problems at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) was a result of the overall slowdown that had already been seeded in the third quarter of 2017-18 when the goods and services tax (GST) was introduced. The current slowdown has lasted for over 18 months and is the longest incident of sluggishness since 2006, the report said.

Deep impact

Automobile sales ‚Äì a commonly used benchmark to gauge the slowdown in the consumption patterns ‚Äì Goldman Sachs believes ‚Äì is just the tip of the iceberg, with other consumption indicators like air passenger traffic, tax collections, and sales of durable and non-durable consumer goods contributing twice the effect of autos.

‚ÄúAutomobiles contributed 17 per cent of the total slowdown, as against a 36 per cent contribution by other consumption-driven factors including bank agriculture credit, vehicle sales, rural wages, fuel consumption, farm exports, fertiliser sales, rail/air passenger traffic, household credit, and electronic exports,‚Äù they wrote.

While fertiliser sales and rail passenger traffic were the only indicators that started to fall towards the end of 2018, several variables, such as agriculture credit, rural wage growth and imports of electronic goods have, in fact, been on a descent since 2017, Goldman Sachs said.

‚ÄúSome part of the slowdown could possibly also be associated with the implementation bottlenecks related to the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) in 2017. Effective credit crunch was consequent to the glitches in the GST refund system which tightened the working capital cycle in the industry, especially for the MSME sector. Year-on-year growth in bank credit started to slow only in late 2018, driven by credit to services; and appears to be a symptom of the slowdown, rather than a cause,‚Äù they noted.

A slowdown in the investment activity, tighter funding conditions, a decline in consumer confidence, high real interest rates, central government expenditure and monsoon were some of the factors that contributed to the overall sluggishness.

‚ÄúThe role of global factors is also very significant; slower growth in India‚Äôs trading partners acted as a major drag on economic activity during this period,‚Äù they said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut repo rate by 110 basis points (bps) since February 2019, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel, the breadth and depth of policy easing have so far been much more limited than during previous occurrences of slower growth in India.

‚ÄúImportantly, policymakers have exercised restraint in easing fiscal policies. Despite being issued in a period marked by a slowing economy and an election year, the FY20 budget did not envisage any additional stimulus through the reported fiscal deficit figures,‚Äù they wrote.

"Bengal: Left Student Activists, Police Clash at Protest Against Unemployment","Howrah: Clashes broke out here on Friday between the police and the Left Front activists when they were marching towards the West Bengal secretariat demanding employment for the youth of the state.

LF leaders claimed that around 60 activists were injured in the clashes, five of them critically, while the police said people on both sides were wounded.

According to sources, police burst tear gas shells and used water cannons to disperse CPI(M) youth and student activists, who in turn hurled stones at them.

Members of Students Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) had taken out a rally on Thursday from Singur, the venue of the abandoned Tata small car plant, demanding jobs for the youth of the state.

The rally was scheduled to culminate at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon, but was stopped 5 km away near Mullick Ghat in Howrah.

Sources said the activists in their attempt to move forward broke one of the three barricades set up by the police at Mullick Ghat.

A scuffle broke out with the agitators hurling bricks at the police, who retaliated by bursting tear gas shells and baton charge, they said.

The injured have been admitted to a nearby government hospital for treatment, the police said.

‚ÄúWe were told by the police that five of our representatives would be allowed to enter the state secretariat to submit a memorandum. But as soon as our peaceful rally reached Mullick Ghat, police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge and bursting of tear gas shells,‚Äù DYFI state secretary Sayandeep Mitra said.

A number of SFI and DYFI workers fell unconscious during the clash, he said.

‚ÄúWe were to submit thousands of applications seeking jobs and answers on various other issues from chief minister Mamata Banerjee as part of the TMC government‚Äôs ‚ÄòDidi ke bolo‚Äò public outreach initiative,‚Äù Mitra told reporters.

Banerjee is referred to as ‚ÄòDidi‚Äô or elder sister by rank and file of the party.

The Mamata Banerjee government is sitting on the ‚Äúdebris of an industry‚Äù at Singur, he said.

‚ÄúShe has failed to bring about economic development in West Bengal. Several business summits were organised over the past few years but no investment has been made. Lakhs of youths are unemployed,‚Äù the Left youth leader added.

Later in the evening, the SFI and DYFI district units took out protest marches in various parts of the state.

The two Left bodies have decided to observe a two-day-long ‚ÄòBlack day‚Äô across the state in the weekend to protest against the police assault.

West Bengal Left Front Chairman and CPI(M) Politburo member Biman Bose condemned the ‚Äúbrutal attack‚Äù on the students and youth activists.

‚ÄúThe way student and youth activists were attacked reflects the authoratarian attitude of the state government,‚Äù CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, who too is a member of the politburo, said.

Countering the allegations, West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said the Left Front activists were trying to disturb the ‚Äúpeaceful atmosphere‚Äù in the state.

‚ÄúWhat was SFI and DYFI doing during the Left Front rule when industries were being shut down and flight of capital from Bengal took place? Were they sleeping? Our government has revived industry in the state,‚Äù Chatterjee, who is also the secretary general of TMC, said.

Singur had become the hotbed of West Bengal politics in 2008 after the Trinamool Congress of Mamata Banerjee led an agitation against the erstwhile Left Front government over acquisition of farm land the car factory.

The TMC agitation eventually led to the exit of the proposed small car factory and catapulted Banerjee to power in 2011.",https://thewire.in/uncategorised/bengal-left-student-activists-police-clash-at-protest-against-unemployment,
"As India's Economy Suffers a Car Crash, Pain Spreads to Villages","Manesar: The narrow lanes in Aliyar and Kasan villages in Manesar, an automotive manufacturing hub on New Delhi‚Äôs southern outskirts, would usually be packed on Sundays with migrant workers employed at the nearby plants enjoying their day off, but not anymore.

These are hard times for an area dependent on the fortunes of companies like Maruti Suzuki, the car maker with the largest market share in India, and motorbike maker Honda Motor Co‚Äôs local unit. The auto and component makers in and around Manesar, have shed thousands of jobs.

Nationwide, according to industry estimates, automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since the start of the year, in response to plunging car sales. Figures for August, like July, are expected to show a drop of more than 30%, making a 10th straight month of decline.

As the crisis in the sector bites harder small businesses in the towns and villages around Manesar, home to one of the three plants where Maruti Suzuki cars are made, have seen a fall-off in trade.

‚ÄúThere are already fewer workers in the village and those who still have jobs are either not getting paid for working overtime or are not spending as much out of fear they may lose work and need the money,‚Äù said grocer Rahul Jain, his shelves stacked with toothpaste and soaps from fast-moving consumer goods companies like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Dabur India.

Even sales of products like cooking oil and flour have fallen. On the lower rungs of the service sector, barbers and tea stall owners said they had fewer customers.

In the United States there was an old adage: ‚ÄúWhen General Motors sneezes, the Wall Street catches a cold.‚Äù In India, the impact goes well beyond the stock market.

India‚Äôs automotive industry is the fourth largest in the world, employing more than 35 million people, directly and indirectly, and accounting for nearly half of India‚Äôs manufacturing output.

The industry has three main centres; Gurugram in the North, Chennai in the South, where among others Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor have plants, and Pune in the West, where Tata Motors and Fiat are located.

All of them are hurting, and the pain is radiating outwards.

Needing a Haircut

Before suffering the steepening slump in sales, the auto industry provided one of the few bright spots for manufacturing. Its troubles stem in part from banks‚Äô and non-banking finance houses‚Äô reluctance to extend consumer loans, as well as subdued demand, particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of Indians live.

Laid-off workers returning to their villages are now putting more burden on a rural sector already suffering falling income from low crop prices and dampening consumer sentiment and growth across the country.

Gurmeet Singh had been earning Rs 10,000 a month until he lost his job at auto component maker Bellsonica in Manesar. Six months later, back in his hometown of Ambala in Haryana state, Singh is still looking for a job, and catastrophising about the future.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had a hair cut in months, my shoes are torn and I‚Äôve been using the same pair of clothes since I lost my job. Only I know how I am surviving,‚Äù said the 26-year-old.

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get a job, how will I build a house for my family, get married and pay off the loan my parents took to educate me?‚Äù he said.

His bleak outlook reflects an increasingly grim big picture. India‚Äôs economic growth slipped to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was re-elected to a second term in a landslide in May, is under pressure to provide a stimulus for an economy that is seriously undershooting the growth rate needed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young Indians entering the labour market every month.

Resisting a haircut

All this is cast against a backdrop of a weakening world economy, and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the United States and China.

Things are so manifestly bad that even one of the nation‚Äôs most popular biscuit makers, Parle Products Private Limited, is worried about the impact of the auto industry‚Äôs troubles on sales.

‚ÄúIf the economy is buoyant then even the rural consumer will not mind paying a little extra. But this (slowdown) has acted as a catalyst to the drop in demand,‚Äù said Mayank Shah, product category head at Parle.

Britannia Industries Ltd, which controls a third of the biscuits market in India, said it has ‚Äúnever seen this kind of a slowdown‚Äù where people are hesitant to buy a pack of biscuits costing just Rs 5 ($0.07).

‚ÄúIf the consumer is thinking twice before buying, then obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy,‚Äù Varun Berry, the company‚Äôs managing director told analysts in a post-earnings call last month.

Under pressure from businesses and investors to provide more stimulus, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures last month to help the economy and financial markets but some economists said it would not be enough to revive long-term demand.

On Aug 23, foreign investment rules were eased for several sectors, and sources say the government is expected to come up with more measures such as tax cuts for autos and real estate.

‚ÄúThe real revenue growth for auto and consumer goods sectors started declining nearly two years ago. The slowdown has merely gained prominence now,‚Äù said Arindam Som, an analyst at India Ratings, a Fitch group company, adding that he expects auto companies to further cut production.

A year ago, Vinod Chauhan had no vacancies at all in the 70 rooms he leased primarily to migrant workers in Manesar‚Äôs Kasan village. Today, over a third of those rooms are vacant and Chauhan fears things could get worse before they get better.

His son won‚Äôt be getting the new car that Chauhan planned to buy him this year, and the landlord has also shelved plans to build another 100 hostel apartments.

‚ÄúIf I am not able to rent out all the rooms I currently have, how will I manage with more?‚Äù said Chauhan.

State of the Economy Is Deeply Worrying: Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said the state of the economy was ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù and urged the government to put aside ‚Äúvendetta politics‚Äù and reach out to sane voices and thinking minds to steer the economy out of this ‚Äúman-made crisis‚Äù.

The Congress leader said ‚Äúall-round mismanagement‚Äù by the Modi government was responsible for the slowdown.

‚ÄúThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 pc signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slow down,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Targeting the government, Singh said the country‚Äôs youth, farmers and farm workers, entrepreneurs and the marginalised sections deserve better.

India cannot afford to continue down this path, he said, adding, ‚ÄúI urge the government to put aside vendetta politics, and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds, to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.‚Äù

Singh said it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6%.

‚ÄúThis makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST,‚Äù he said.

The former prime minister alleged that institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded.

On the government taking Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the RBI reserves, Singh said the resilience of the RBI will be tested after this record transfer to the government.

This, he said, ‚Äúclaims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall‚Äù.

Noting that domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18-month low and nominal GDP growth is at a 15-year low, he said, ‚ÄúThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiments are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recover‚Äù.

Blaming the Modi government‚Äôs policies for massive job-less growth, he said more than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone.

There will similarly be large-scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting most vulnerable workers, he said.

He said rural India is in terrible shape as farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined.

The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their incomes, by inflicting misery on over 50% of India‚Äôs population, he alleged.

Watch: How Will RBI‚Äôs 1.76 Lakh Crore Reserve Transfer Help The Economy?

The former prime minister, a noted economist, said the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

‚ÄúBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase its exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignments. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government,‚Äù he alleged.

The scathing attack by the former prime minister comes after the country reported a slow GDP growth rate of 5% for the first quarter of this fiscal.

Can India's Rich Wealth Creators Boost the Economy to $5 Trillion?,"Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Independence Day, said that wealth creation is a national service and that wealth creators should not be viewed with suspicion.

Furthermore, he added, only when wealth is created can it be distributed.

Wealth creation is a great national service. Let us never see wealth creators with suspicion. Only when wealth is created, wealth will be distributed. Wealth creation is absolutely essential. Those who create wealth are India‚Äôs wealth and we respect them: PM @narendramodi ‚Äî PMO India (@PMOIndia) August 15, 2019



These statements come at a time when the economy is facing severe headwinds and yet, the prime minister has set a tough target of almost doubling the economy to $5 trillion in the next five years. Even if it is in nominal rupee terms, including a depreciation of the rupee by 15%, it would require an average 16% rate of growth over the next five years. Investments which have been significantly down compared to their peak in 2012-13 have refused to show an uptrend and without that, the target is unachievable.

Private investors are not boosting their investment significantly. The rich are unhappy about the additional cess levied on incomes above Rs 2 crore in the budget presented in July. Other changes pertaining to the corporate sector have also acted as a spoiler for businessmen. Important corporate leaders, who were earlier supporters of the current ruling dispensation, are ticked off enough to speak out about the deteriorating climate for investment. They have also complained of tax terrorism by the tax departments.

Modi‚Äôs words on Independence Day therefore were a balm to the frayed nerves of the business community.

Also read: In U-Turn, FM Nirmala Sitharaman Rolls Back FPI Tax Announced in Budget

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman followed it up this week after announcing some sops to the investors. This came on the back of Niti Aayog boss Rajiv Kumar saying that India hasn‚Äôt seen a liquidity crisis like this in the last 70 years. Prior to that, the RBI governor and members of the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister had also stated that there is a slowdown. The concessions now announced by the finance minister are also an admission of a declining economy.

But is it not too little too late. Sitharaman maintained that Indian economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. So, the package announced caters to the corporate sectors and not to the root cause of the problem. It shows the clout of the corporate sector with the government and the belief that they are the wealth creators and need to be mollified.

But are businessmen the only wealth creators?

In India there are about 35 million demat accounts. Presumably they represent those who trade in the stock markets. That is less than 3% of the population. But most of the stocks are held by a tiny percent of the corporates, foreign portfolio investments (FP!s) and financial institutions.

A large number of people also save small sums of money and invest it. These are the households, the savers whose money is invested in financial assets and banks, and from the banks it goes to the investors. So, while encouraging businesses, one should not forget the workers, farmers, the officegoers, etc. ‚Äì we should celebrate everyone. But Modi did not mention them and Sitharaman has not catered to them.

Stagnant rate

The moot point is why is the investment rate stagnant? Output and employment have been stagnant or declining. Not only is enough new work is not being created for those entering the labour force, but workers have been losing employment as various surveys show. Consequently, as real income has declined for a large segment of the workers, demand has fallen short.

Furthermore, according to an OXFAM report, disparities have grown rapidly with nine people having as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the population. And, the top 1% of the population hold 51% of the national wealth. Clearly, the top wealth holders have been cornering a disproportionate share of the wealth and incomes of the economy. So, do they need more incentive or is it those at the bottom who need more support?

This kind of extreme inequality raises the question ‚Äì who should be taxed how much? According to the ‚Äòability to pay‚Äô principle of taxation, those with higher incomes and wealth ought to pay not only higher taxes but higher tax rates.

After the global crisis in 2007-08, Warren Buffet said that the rich need to pay more tax for capitalism to survive. This has been repeated again recently. Buffet‚Äôs statement was supported by the rich in the US, Germany, Italy and France. But the Indian rich do not seem to want to pay more taxes.

How much more tax the rich should pay is a political decision.

Fixing rates

An income of Rs 2 crore is 160 times the current per capita income. There are very few people in this category. According to tax data, 1.5 lakh individuals declare an income above Rs 1 crore. The number of people declaring an income above Rs 5 crore is 6,361. The number declaring an income above Rs 2 crore is around 40,000. The number of tax filers in India in 2018-19 was 61 million. So, those impacted by the higher tax rate would be only 0.1% of the tax payers and 0.004% of the population.

The new tax rates after the increase in surcharge are comparable to what people earning similar amounts pay in some of the advanced countries like, Germany. In reality the tax rates paid by the rich are much less than what appears to be on paper. They take advantage of innumerable concessions and deductions allowed to them and they resort to black income generation by declaring only a part of their incomes. Warren Buffet once said that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary because of these tax concessions. In India, the situation is likely to be even worse given the resort to large black income generation by the rich.

The Indian rich unfortunately compare the tax rates on paper to those in some of the developing countries or in the South East Asian economies. Since capital has become highly mobile, they threaten to leave India. There are 90 tax havens and funds can be easily moved out through them through the process of ‚Äòlayering‚Äô, erasing the trail for the agencies to catch them.

Flight of capital

Further, since 2014, 23,000 of these rich people, called high net-worth individuals (HNWI), have left India. So, a large number of ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are voting with their feet?

Flight of capital is a risk minimisation strategy to relocate in tax havens which offer low tax rates and a high degree of secrecy. The US has been complaining that rich companies have been relocating their offices to jurisdictions with low tax rates, like, Google and Starbucks moving to Ireland. This is called BEPS (Base Erosion Profit Shifting). So, globally, many of the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are more concerned about their profits and less about national well-being.

The Indian economy has suffered due to the shocks administered by the government in the form of demonetisation and GST. Add to this the non-bank financial institution and the non-performing assets problem of the financial sector. Though the official data does not reflect it, the economy has been tanking with capacity utilisation at around 75%. This is the real cause of the lack of pick up in private investment and cannot be countered by cut in tax rates or cuts in interest rates or by a boost to the stock markets as the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô have been demanding. The RBI has cut interest rates by 1% over the last one year and the stock market has been on a high but investment rate has not budged.

In the current quarter, the official nominal rate of growth is about 7% so how can it be raised to 16% if the private sector investment does not rise sharply. Foreign investment is small and uncertain given global and national uncertainties. Meanwhile, the government has proposed Rs 100 lakh crore investment in five years.

But this year, the capital expenditure in the budget is pegged at Rs 8.5 lakh crore (including the public sector) ‚Äì nowhere close to the average of Rs 20 lakh crore targeted. So, the prospects of reaching $5 trillion by 2024 are bleak even if the rich are incentivised and their hurt feelings are soothed from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea,"Parle Products‚Äô announcement that it may have to let go up to 10,000 employees has caused a stir as big as news of a recession in the auto sector. Demand has been falling and government policies have further exacerbated the crisis, says the company.

Surely people can afford a packet of biscuits, one might ask. And that is true. But the news indicates something deeper, that people‚Äôs purchasing power has reduced so much that they are holding back from spending on even low price products. It shows that India is in, or at least is heading towards, a recession and no one seems to have a clue on how to handle it.

A biscuit cannot be compared with a car ‚Äì the latter is a one-time buy that doesn‚Äôt get changed very often, while consumers buy biscuits regularly, often several times a week. That people are reluctant to commit a few lakhs is understandable, but when they demur from spending as little as Rs 5, it is indicative of a deep economic crisis.

The allure of Parle G

A senior executive from the company had once told me that there was no part of India, however remote, where Parle G biscuits were not available. He had been to distant villages in the Himalayas, tiny hamlets in the hinterland and on generally inaccessible trekking routes, and found at least one shop with the biscuit on its shelves. He put it down not just to an efficient distribution network but also to the fact that there was a demand for Parle G, which meant that the shopkeepers themselves sought it out.

The biscuit, said the executive, fulfilled many kinds of requirements. It could be had at the start of the day with a cup of piping hot tea, it was a snack to be packed in children‚Äôs lunchboxes, a quick bite whenever someone was hungry and lunch was some time away, and a nutritious sugar boost to a labourer.

Most of all, it was cheap. It was a company mantra, he said, that a packet of Parle G biscuits would cost the same year after year. Of course, prices changed, but the company ensured that the entry-level price points would hold steady. This was done by changing packet sizes or through other ways, but the price remained the same. Taxes, if any, were incorporated into the final price. For the buyer, especially those who could not afford to spend more, it appeared that while prices of all essential goods ‚Äì everything really ‚Äì went up all the time, this was a constant. It added to the appeal of the product.

There are other brand attributes too ‚Äì quality is one, trust is another, and now, increasingly, nostalgia. Indian students living overseas frequently ask visiting friends and relatives to bring Parle G packets. Faced with changes in market trends, the company had banked heavily on nostalgia to remind customers of their product. Millennials have several more snack choices and for a demographic which seeks out ‚Äòartisanal cookies‚Äô, Parle G may appear old fashioned, a relic from an earlier time.

But those are normal challenges of the market place, as is competition. The company has, over the years, still maintained its leadership position and only expanded. But where changing tastes could not affect it, the government‚Äôs policies have. The imposition of GST drove prices up, and along with growing unemployment, job losses, and a bleak outlook for the future means that even a packet of biscuits has begun looking like a discretionary spend.

Other concerning developments

People cannot do without lunch, but they can forego another cup of tea, and with it, a biscuit or two. For a daily wage worker or a contract labourer, every rupee counts ‚Äì the uncertainty that there may not be any job, and therefore wages tomorrow, means it becomes imperative to save every paisa. Even for the salaried person, there is no guarantee that the job will exist in a few months; the auto sectors travails get a lot of media attention, but companies, big, medium and small are laying off large numbers of people without media coverage.

The collapse of Jet Airways meant that thousands of well-qualified, hardworking professionals found themselves jobless overnight, with little or no chance of getting back wages. They have mortgages, rents and school fees to pay ‚Äì they would undoubtedly think ten times before taking a vacation. The same applies on a different scale to the construction worker, who with no building activity anywhere, will think ten times before buying that packet of biscuits.

Industry associations have asked the government to provide relief to help keep their businesses running. This is understandable, though a pure classical free market economist might argue that these are the vagaries of business and therefore industrialists shouldn‚Äôt ask for the government for help. Grow up and don‚Äôt run to Papa like kids, is what the government‚Äôs economic adviser has told businessmen. (They may find this suggestion gratuitous, but don‚Äôt expect any businessmen to respond or complain in public.)

But the fact is that the government needs to attend to the growing sense of despair at the condition of the economy. Big business will find ways to tide over the crisis, even if it means letting go of employees and downsizing. But the small man has no safety net. He has no savings to fall back on, nor any government dole to rely on.

The NREGA scheme

At one time, schemes like the NREGA brought income to the unemployed all over the country ‚Äì they got jobs, wages and a sense of dignity. During the much-maligned UPA government‚Äôs administration, industrial and contract wages shot up because labourers preferred to go to their villages and get employment under NREGA. That has been curtailed and even if the government would like to, it cannot revive it in any significant way because it has no money to pay.

One of the big issues about GST is that back payments have been stuck in the pipeline for months ‚Äì that is a double whammy, since it not only sucks money out of businesses, it makes the products expensive and unaffordable.

The lack of investment by businesses, banks holding back loans, the collapse of NBFCs and the chaos created by demonetisation and the poor design and implementation of the GST has meant that no new jobs are being created. Old jobs have been lost, there is no growth and people have no money to spend. It is a vicious circle and a government preoccupied with its political and ideological agenda has little or no time to revive the economy.

The buzz words are there and the budget was all about ‚Äònudging‚Äô behaviour and competing with China to become a $5 trillion economy by the time the next elections roll around. To the industrialists who are holding back from expanding because they are not sure of demand, there is no clarity on how the government will facilitate investment to become a global player; to the salaried person who worries she may not be able to pay her EMIs, grand statements about the future mean little. And for the daily wage worker, all that matters is regular work so that he can buy a packet of biscuits for his family.

Economists talk about the ‚Äòunderwear index‚Äô which can detect the beginnings of economic recovery during a slump. There should now be a ‚Äòbiscuit index‚Äô that indicates that the economy is now in acute economic distress.

Slowdown in various sectors to cost lakhs of jobs

As reported earlier in this column, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades costing lakhs of jobs and set to affect many more. Another labour-intensive sector, textile, is staring at a slowdown that could cost and has requested to the government to intervene to avoid job losses and prevent NPAs in the spinning sector. The Northern India Textile Mills Association (NITMA) has placed full-page advertisements in newspapers to urge the government to act on their demands.

An estimated 40,000 people employed by the diamond cutting and polishing units in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have lost their jobs in the past few months, The Tribune reported.

Parle Products, country‚Äôs largest biscuit maker has warned that it may have to let go of 8,000 to 10,000 employees owing to slowdown in consumption. Another biscuit giant, Britannia, has voiced similar concerns saying consumers are thinking twice before buying even Rs 5 products.

Strike at 41 ordnance factories halts defence production

After the government announced its decision to corporatise ordnance factories, around 80,000-1 lakh employees across 41 factories started a month-long strike on Tuesday. Ordnance factories supply arms, ammunitions and other equipment exclusively to Indian armed forces. The decision to corporatise was taken after ‚Äúthe Comptroller Auditor General (CAG), the government‚Äôs auditor, and the armed forces, repeatedly raised issue of quality and delays in delivery of equipment by the ordnance factories,‚Äù Hindustan Times reported.

However, employee unions in the factories have vehemently opposed this move. All trade unions, including the RSS‚Äôs Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, have offered support and solidarity to the striking employees. Unions have claimed that the strike was total on the first day and there was no production. Employees call this move arbitrary saying, ‚Äúordnance factories, being war-reserve and solely dependent on the armed forces, cannot function as a commercially viable PSU‚Äù.

The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which oversees the factories, is perhaps the oldest government-run entity in India, predating even the Railways.

RSS-affiliated trade union criticises ‚Äòwrong‚Äô labour policies, slams NITI Aayog

At its 144th national committee meeting in Delhi last weekend, RSS-affiliated BMS criticised the government‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù economic and labour policies. While accepting that the government was trying ‚Äúits level best‚Äù to boost economy, employment and skill development, the BMS said all these efforts were negated by ‚Äúwrong direction‚Äù of policy making bodies. ‚ÄúTheir main role ends up in converting India‚Äôs economy into a capitalist economy and all other developmental activities become ancillary,‚Äù their statement said.

They called for an India-centric development plan ‚Äúrather than that dictated by western rating agencies and institutions like WTO, WB and IMF‚Äù. They asked for restructuring of the NITI Aayog so as to ‚Äúremove its apathy‚Äù towards social organisations and trade unions. Hitting out at the policy think tank of the government, it added that ‚ÄúHarvard university experts who have no knowledge about Indian realities are the last word for them‚Äù.

While the BMS earlier welcomed the Wage Code Bill, the statement says that the ‚Äúso called labour law reforms‚Äù have contributed in damaging our economy. ‚ÄúThe Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) welcomes this codification and simplification of labour laws. But we opposed many of the anti-worker provisions in the labour codes,‚Äù it said, adding that six units in a family should be considered while deciding minimum wages. This, they say, is to be in sync with social realities of today that includes ageing parents.

They also flagged the crisis in the auto sector and said disinvestment from public sector has caused ‚Äúpanic‚Äù in the minds of the employees. The statement added that rise in contractualisation was a sign of ‚Äúfalling and distressed‚Äù private sector, adding that privatisation can‚Äôt be a remedy for the economy.

Threefold rise in number of manual scavengers despite ban

An RTI filed by The Wire has revealed that the number of manual scavengers in India has gone up from 14,505 in 2013 to 41,420 in 2018. This after a 2013 law had banned the practice of manual scavenging altogether.

The National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC), which works under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, had conducted a survey in 170 districts of 18 states. In those districts, a total of 86,528 people described their work as ‚Äúmanual cleaning of waste‚Äù. Oddly, the government identified only about half of them (41,420) as manual scavengers even when all had registered their occupation as the same.

Bihar, Haryana, Telangana and J&K have claimed they have no manual scavengers employed in their states.

"Economic Slowdown 'Very Worrisome', New Set of Reforms Needed: Raghuram Rajan","New Delhi: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has called slowdown in the economy ‚Äúvery worrisome‚Äù and said the government needs to fix the immediate problems in power and non-bank financial sectors and come out with a new set of reforms to energise the private sector to invest.

Rajan, who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016 but was denied a second term, also called for a fresh look at the way GDP in India is calculated, as he referred to research by Narendra Modi government‚Äôs former chief economist Arvind Subramanian about overestimation of growth rate.

‚ÄúThere are a variety of growth projections from the private sector analysts, many of which are perhaps significantly below government projections and I think certainly the slowdown in the economy is something that is very worrisome,‚Äù Rajan told CNBC TV18.

In ominous signs that the slowdown may be deep, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades with reports suggesting thousands of job losses in the automobile and ancillary industry, real estate sector has huge unsold inventory, while fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have reported a decline in volume growth.

‚ÄúYou can hear businesses all around worrying and complaining out loud that they need some kind of stimulus,‚Äù he said.

Rajan said ‚Äúa fresh set of reforms‚Äù are now needed to boost the economy and growth rate.

‚ÄúWe need a fresh set of reforms informed by view on what we want India to be and I would love for that view to be articulated at the very top (that) here is the kind of economy that we want. One-off programs here and there don‚Äôt amount to a comprehensive reform agenda for the economy,‚Äù he said, adding borrowing in international markets is not really a reform but a ‚Äútactical action‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat we really need is an understanding of how we are going to propel this country by the two or three percentage points greater growth that it needs and that needs fixing the immediate problems such as in the power sector, such as in the non-bank financial sector and those need to be done yesterday, not in the next six months, it is very important that those be tackled immediately,‚Äù he said.

Sops, stimulus of one kind or the other are not going to be that useful in the longer-term especially given the very tight fiscal situation that we have. Instead bold reforms, well thought of, not jumping off the cliff, but really seriously thought out reforms in a variety of areas which energise the Indian people, energise the Indian markets and energise Indian business.

‚ÄúThis is what we need today and I really hope we put our best minds to think about this because absent that my sense is that we are in for not so good times,‚Äù he said.

The former governor also drew attention to former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs research that GDP growth was overestimated by 2.5% during 2011-12 and 2016-17.

‚ÄúI also think that we should pay attention to some of the arguments made by the former chief economist Arvind Subramanian that in fact we may be overestimating growth with some of the new GDP data and I would suggest ‚Äì I have been saying this for some time ‚Äì we need fresh look from an independent group of experts at the way we compute GDP and make sure that we are not in a sense having GDP numbers that mislead and cause the wrong kinds of policy actions,‚Äù he said.

On the ongoing global economic slowdown, Rajan said that in comparison to the 2008 financial crisis, the banks are better levered across the globe.

‚ÄúHistory never repeats. So, I think there is more leverage than there was in 2008 but it is not in the same places. Banks are less levered than they were then. On the other hand, some corporate sectors, certainly in the United States are more levered, certainly in China are more levered and of course governments are more levered,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, leverage was the big factor in 2008, it is different today. Not necessarily better, but different.‚Äù

Rajan said that he can‚Äôt predict another big financial crash but if it comes, it will be from different sources.

‚ÄúThe big issue today is not so much the financial sector frenzy, there is some but real (issue) is trade and global investments and the worries are that if we don‚Äôt pay enough attention, the old global order is going out of the window and there is nothing really to replace it to keep countries from doing things that serve their own interest rather than the global interest. So, it is a different world,‚Äù he said.

Asked about 2008 meltdown repeating, he said: ‚ÄúDo I predict a big crash coming? I don‚Äôt know but I do think that it is going to come from different sources and simply fixing the old problems is not going to prevent the new ones‚Äù.",https://thewire.in/economy/raghuram-rajan-economic-slowdown-worrisome,
"Mahindra Warns of Job Losses in Auto Sector, Seeks Government Help","Mumbai/Bengaluru: Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Wednesday it saw a ‚Äúhuge danger‚Äù of job losses in the ailing domestic auto sector, as it sought government intervention, including tax reductions to revive demand.

A lending crisis among the country‚Äôs shadow banks, which fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles and 30% of passenger cars, has led to automakers, including M&M and its rivals Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, to either cut production or temporarily close plants.

M&M said in a statement it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices and the government must reduce the Goods and Services tax (GST) rate to spur demand.

A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectly. Reuters reported on Tuesday that initial estimates suggest automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April.

‚ÄúNow job losses are happening in four areas OEMs (original equipment makers), suppliers, dealers and unorganised sector,‚Äù Managing Director Pawan Goenka told reporters in Mumbai in a post-earnings press meet.

M&M‚Äôs heavy goods segment, which makes trucks and tippers, saw its worst growth in nearly six years, the company added, as it reported a June-quarter consolidated profit that nearly halved from a year ago to Rs 9.14 billion ($129.10 million).

Two Lakh Jobs Cut in Last 3 Months Across Automobile Dealerships: FADA,"New Delhi: Around two lakh jobs have been cut across automobile dealerships in India in the last three months as vehicle retailers take the last resort of cutting manpower to tide over the impact of the unprecedented sales slump, according to industry body FADA.

With no immediate signs of recovery, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government intervention such as reduction of GST to provide relief to the auto industry.

‚ÄúThe majority of job cuts have happened in the last three months. It started around May and continued through June and July,‚Äù FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI.

He further said, ‚ÄúRight now most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this (slowdown) continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less, so it is a cycle.‚Äù

When asked how many jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India, he said, ‚ÄúClose to about two lakh.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a guesstimate that our members have already cut 7-8% of the jobs in most of the dealerships as the degrowth has been very high,‚Äù he added.

Around 2.5 million people were employed directly through around 26,000 automobile showrooms operated by 15,000 dealers. Another 2.5 million are indirectly employed in the dealership ecosystem, he added.

The two lakh jobs cuts in the last three months are over and above the 32,000 people who lost employment when 286 showrooms were closed across 271 cities in the 18-month period ended April this year, he added.

Stating that more dealerships have closed in the past three months, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are collating the figures again. In a few cases some (dealers) have gone for closure of outlets, not the main outlets but those which were put up anticipating some geographic reach.‚Äù

Elaborating on reasons for taking the drastic step of cutting jobs, he said the ‚Äòmargin of error‚Äô in the business in the past few years has really gone down with cost almost doubling in the last three to four years.

‚ÄúThe margin that we earn overall as a business has not gone up. Therefore, if we go into a degrowth situation we get into cash loss. So to avoid that, dealers have been cutting down on costs other than manpower. Till March this year none of the dealers went for any manpower correction because we thought this was a temporary slowdown and it will soon recover,‚Äù he said.

However, he said, ‚ÄúThe way the first quarter has panned out despite good election results and the Budget, the degrowth continued. It is clear now that a proper slowdown has hit us. Now dealers have resorted to cutting manpower.‚Äù

Terming manpower as ‚Äòthe most precious resource of dealers‚Äô, Kale said, ‚ÄúThat is the last thing we try to cut down. When the slowdown started we first decided that we should go for stock reduction. Most of OEMs have supported us. While cutting other variable expenses that we can, we did not touch manpower till March and almost mid-April.‚Äù

Ruing the loss of jobs, he said, ‚ÄúIt is the last resort because it is difficult to get those manpower. We invest a lot on training them because it is a peculiar industry, whether it is a technical or a field job.‚Äù

As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) figures, vehicle wholesale across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.

On the other hand, as per data based on registrations collated by FADA, automobile retail sales in the April-June period declined by 6% to 51,16,718 units in the first quarter of this fiscal as against 54,42,317 units in the year-ago period.

Passenger vehicles (PV) segment has been the worst hit with sales continuing to decline for almost a year now. In July, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 36.3% drop in its domestic PV wholesales, while Hyundai saw a dip of 10%.

M&M sales were down 16%, Tata Motors‚Äô PV sales fell 31% while that of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) also came down 48.67% during the month.

Seeking immediate government intervention, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are hoping, from whatever we are hear that the government has taken note of the serious situation that is going on in the overall economy, specifically with the auto sector. We are hoping for some support for the auto sector in the next few days or week or two.‚Äù He said the auto industry has already put out a request for GST cut.

‚ÄúIt is not a permanent demand. We know GST is such a huge developmental agenda for the government, but at the same time (it is needed for) reviving the auto industry. We (auto industry) are almost 8% of the GDP and 49% of manufacturing GDP,‚Äù Kale said.

He said while the revival of monsoon holds out hope, resolution of liquidity crisis, specially with the NBFCs, will go along way in helping the auto industry recover from one of the worst sales slumps in its history.",https://thewire.in/business/two-lakh-jobs-cut-in-last-3-months-across-automobile-dealerships-fada,
Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking,"Question of livelihood and the lived reality of people, sooner or later, catch up with any democratically-elected government.

One of the major promises on which the 2014 elections were won was massive job creation. Even after its stunning victory in 2019, primarily fought on the national security plank, among the first things the new Narendra Modi government did was to set up a cabinet committee to create jobs.

Clearly, the sensitivity of the livelihood issue is recognised and likely to be taken up by the opposition in coming days, with the potential of quickly altering opinions.

In fact, there was wide speculation after the resignation of the chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) that the employment data, showing the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, was willfully suppressed.

Finally, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data was made public on May 31, 2019. What does it show?

Key takeaways

Preliminary analysis of PLFS data shows that the most striking news ‚Äì for the first time in 45 years, ever since NSS have been conducted ‚Äì is the contraction of aggregate employment by 1.2 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18 (Table 1).

Aggregate employment, which stood at 472.5 million in 2011-12, came down to 471.3 million in 2017-18. This is primarily driven by rural women losing 24.7 million jobs ‚Äî other segments of the workforce however saw net addition to jobs.

Table 1: Aggregate change in employment (million) Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker Total worker 2017-18 239.0 77.0 123.8 31.5 471.3 2011-12 234.4 101.6 109.1 27.4 472.5 Net change 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

The decline in the rural female workforce is not new ‚Äì this has been happening for quite some time now. In the earlier period, between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the female workforce in rural areas shrank ‚Äì although the magnitude of the decline was less than in the current period ‚Äì by 21.8 million (Table 2).

The other big takeaway from PLFS data is the close to a fourfold slowdown in employment creation for rural males. Thus, the jobs crisis prominently visible in the previous period in rural female segment seems to have spread to the rural male segment now ‚Äì as employment in the latter segment merely increased by 4.6 million in the current period, compared to 16.8 million in the previous one ‚Äì engulfing the whole rural economy.

Hence, much more is needed than simple cash transfer schemes, increasing MSPs periodically or debt reliefs. Public investment in agriculture along with energising MGNREGS (to help create rural infrastructure), among others, should be on the cards.

Moreover, the pace of employment expansion for urban males also decelerated in the recent period (14.7 million) compared to the previous one (17.6 million). It is only in the urban female segment that employment growth picked up, registering 4.1 million increase compared to 2.1 million in the previous period.

Table 2: Comparing employment change with the earlier period (million) Time period Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker Total worker 2017-18 over 2011-12 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2 2011-12 over 2004-05 16.8 -21.8 17.6 2.1 14.7

Sectoral distribution

There is another way of looking at the employment debacle. It is to look at the sectoral distribution of employment. With the majority of rural persons still engaged in agriculture, a crisis in the rural economy most prominently manifests itself in agricultural employment. People in large numbers (27.1 million) deserted agriculture between 2011-12 and 2017-18, once again led by rural female workers (19.8 million) (Table 3).

This decline in agricultural employment is visible across every segment of the workforce, except urban males. Therefore, the much-discussed unremunerative returns from agriculture are confirmed by the latest data. People are seen to be leaving agriculture, primarily due to push factors, for there was inadequate absorption in non-agricultural sectors of the economy (25.9 million). Precisely, due to this reason ‚Äì more people abandoning agriculture than the available non-agricultural jobs ‚Äì aggregate employment has shrunk.

Also read: What Does the Periodic Labour Force Survey Tell Us?

Table 3 also shows the struggles faced by the ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô programme and the futility of enormous money spent on imparting skills, as these were primarily targeted at boosting manufacturing employment. Overall, manufacturing employment growth turned negative (0.9 million) and benefits of ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô programme seem to have bypassed every section of the workforce, except urban males.

Thus, a comprehensive well-calibrated manufacturing policy focusing on the labour-intensive sectors seems to be the need of the hour. The construction sector, which is widely viewed as the employer of last resort in the previous period, barely managed to absorb 4.6 million new workers in the current period. How does this compare with the previous period?

Table 3: Employment change in major sectors: 2017-18 over 2011-12 (million) Major sectors Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker All workers Agriculture -7.8 -19.8 0.6 -0.1 -27.1 Manufacturing -0.6 -3.7 3.3 0.1 -0.9 Construction 4.2 -2.6 2.8 0.2 4.6 Non-agricultural 12.4 -4.9 14.2 4.3 25.9 Total 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

Source: PFLS 2017-18

Table 4 compares the capacity of labour absorption in key sectors of the economy over two periods. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the construction sector added 24 million jobs, becoming the largest sector of the economy in terms of job creation.

Thus, compared to the previous period, there is more than fivefold deceleration in job growth in the construction sector. The manufacturing sector absorbed 5.3 million workers in the earlier period, which posted negative growth in the present period mentioned above.

Table 4: Comparing sectoral employment change with the earlier period (million) Time period Agriculture Manufacturing Construction Non-agricultural Total 2017-18 over 2011-12 -27.1 -0.9 4.6 25.9 -1.2 2011-12 over 2004-05 -34.4 5.3 24 48.9 14.6

Source: PFLS 2017-18

Slowdown in non-agricultural jobs

The alarming situation in the aggregate labour market can also be comprehended from the slowdown in non-agricultural job growth. Notice from Table 4, a larger number of people moved out of agriculture (34.4 million) between 2004-05 and 2011-12, compared to the recent period (27.1 million) ‚Äì2011-12 and 2017-18.

However, aggregate employment still expanded by 14.6 million in the previous period, while in the present period, we already noted that employment shrunk by 1.2 million. This is simply because labour absorption in non-agriculture almost halved in the current period; while employment in non-agriculture expanded by 48.9 million in the previous period, presently it could only absorb 25.9 million fresh workers.

Thus, there is an urgent necessity to revive non-agricultural employment alongside supporting agriculture.

Finally, on the issue of comparability of PLFS with earlier NSS rounds. First, P.C. Mohanan, who resigned as NSC chairman, categorically mentioned: ‚ÄúWhen we [National Statistical Commission] approve a report, I am not going to give a figure which is not comparable with the other ones. Second, the concept of employment and unemployment are universally accepted. International Labour Organization prescribes the standards, we all follow it.‚Äù

Second, professor R. Ramakumar pointed out that the sampling design only changed at a later stage (second stage stratification) and there are inbuilt mechanisms to correct over/under-representation of any group.

Finally, by saying underemployment rates are not comparable with earlier rounds due to educational factors, it is implicitly argued that those looking for jobs but unable to find it are voluntarily unemployed. It is a cruel joke on those unable to find work, given the employment situation described above, when traditional sectors of the economy are shedding/inadequately absorbing labour and modern sectors are incapable of accommodating them (including the educated). Instead of denying the jobs crisis, it should be tackled head-on, for any government neglecting these facts does so at its own peril.

Chugging along - India‚Äôs economy is back on track. Can it pick up speed?,"IT IS easy to be awed by the Indian railway network. The 23m passengers it carries daily travel, in total, over ten times the distance to the sun and back. It is just as easy to find it unimpressive. Delays are frequent and trains antiquated. It takes 14 hours to get from India‚Äôs capital, Delhi, to its commercial hub, Mumbai. The equivalent trip in China‚Äîfrom Beijing to Shanghai, a similar distance‚Äîtakes just over four hours.

Similarly, India‚Äôs economy can be seen in two lights. Its long-term growth rate of 7% a year has proved far more dependable than the rail timetable. GDP has doubled twice in the past two decades. Yet deep poverty still lingers and jobs are scarce. And Indian growth has been left in the dust by the Chinese express (see chart).

After slow running for much of 2017, India is now near to full throttle. Growth of 7.2% in the three months to December put it ahead of China (which grew at a relatively leisurely 6.8%) and made it once again the world‚Äôs fastest-expanding big economy. Expectations for the rest of 2018 are similar.

Fans of Narendra Modi, India‚Äôs prime minister, credit structural reforms he has made over the past four years. The more plausible explanation is that Indian growth has returned to trend after a bout of political meddling. ‚ÄúDemonetisation‚Äù in late 2016, when most banknotes ceased to be legal tender overnight, squeezed growth to 5.7% in the first half of last year. New notes were printed, but last July, even as life was returning to normal, a new goods and services tax replaced hundreds of local and nationwide taxes, once again throwing the economy into confusion. At least the tax overhaul, which knits India into a single market for the first time, will eventually increase growth. Boosters speak of annual GDP gains of 8-10% in the years ahead. That would not be far short of China in its boom years. Renewed economic vim would be welcomed by the government in the run-up to elections due by early 2019. Even at 7% growth, too few jobs are created to absorb roughly 1m new entrants into the workforce every month. More than 20m people recently applied for 100,000 railway jobs, as train drivers, technicians and porters. A third of 15- to 29-year-olds are not in school, training or jobs. Mr Modi‚Äôs opponents have found that the theme of scarce employment opportunities has played well with voters. Faster expansion would help. But predictions of Chinese-style growth seem over-optimistic in the absence of deeper economic reforms. Doing business in India has become easier in some ways, such as getting permits or bringing in foreign capital. But the labour market is as gummed up as ever. Private businesses find securing land for new factories near-impossible. Whole swathes of the economy, from coal and steel to banking and condom-making, remain at least partly under state control.

The hangover from a bout of over-exuberance dating from before the global financial crisis has left companies financially stretched and with enough production capacity to be able to delay capital expenditure. A few sectors are now contemplating investment‚Äîonly to find that banks may be unable to provide finance. Loans written off or considered likely to turn sour are near a fifth of the loan book at state-owned lenders, which have about 70% of market share. The resulting losses have left banks short of capital for fresh loans, though a planned bail-out and new bankruptcy code should, belatedly, help clear up the mess. Worse, a recently discovered fraud at a state lender, where rogue employees allegedly facilitated $2bn of loans to a diamond merchant who is now nowhere to be found, has highlighted their weak governance.

Early in Mr Modi‚Äôs premiership growth was helped by the tumbling price of oil, which India imports in vast quantities. But the price of crude, which fell from $110 to $30 a barrel during his first two years, has since rebounded to $65. Any higher and some familiar problems, namely current-account deficits, budget shortfalls and high inflation, will make an unwelcome return. Yields on Indian government bonds have risen from 6.4% last summer to around 7.5%, indicating some increase in investor concern.

Although India‚Äôs growth has depended less than, say, China‚Äôs on exports, it has benefited from a buoyant global economy and an open trade environment. The latter may be changing. Indian IT firms are facing restrictions on their employees working in America, challenging their business model. And India itself has taken a protectionist turn, recently imposing tariffs on a wide range of products, from mobile phones to perfume, in an ill-conceived bid to encourage domestic production.

‚ÄúIndia is a country that disappoints both optimists and pessimists,‚Äù notes Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley, a bank. Naysayers who expected political meddling to hit the economy hard underestimated its resilience. Like commuters whose train has finally pulled in, optimists feel their time has come.

Economy - A downturn in India reveals the desperate need for deeper reform,"W ITHIN A FEW years, Indian planners hope that bullet trains will reduce the time taken for the 500km (310 miles) journey between Mumbai, the commercial capital, and Ahmedabad, the biggest city in Mr Modi‚Äôs home state of Gujarat, from six hours to just two. For now, laws that protect tiny properties are holding up the railway‚Äôs construction. Two years after breaking ground, the Japanese-financed project has not yet managed to acquire even half the land it needs. By contrast, China added another 4,000km of track for its nationwide high-speed network in 2018 alone.

Historians reckon that the two Asian giants have had roughly equal economies for much of their history. Only since the 1990s, when China began its daring, deep-seated economic reforms, has it raced ahead. Its nominal GDP is now five times India‚Äôs. The dragon has slowed its pace, but even so, notes a report by Rakesh Mohan, a Yale professor and former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), the country‚Äôs central bank, it is still adding the equivalent of a quarter of India‚Äôs economy every year. If India were to sustain its GDP growth per person of 7%‚Äîabout its average for the past two decades‚Äîto 2030, it would barely have got to where China is today. And even that may prove ambitious.

Now, with alarming speed, India has gone from being the world‚Äôs fastest-growing large economy to something more like a rumbling Indian railway train. In the quarter to June, growth slipped to 5%, the slowest in six years. Other indicators are more worrying still. Sales of trucks and buses fell 45% in the year to September, and even sales of cheap biscuits and soap have contracted. The 88% drop in overall credit flows to businesses in the two quarters to September compared with the same period last year suggests a virtual freeze on lending.

Believing its own boosterism, the government failed to see the signs. Yet even as the slowdown became more pronounced, Mr Modi still managed to get himself re-elected in May with a huge majority. The first budget of his second term, announced in July by the incoming finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, signalled business as usual. The emphasis was on new taxes, more handouts, more regulations, a further bail-out of public-sector banks and the airy goal of doubling India‚Äôs GDP to $5trn within five years. As the summer wore on, however, it became clearer that the economy had turned against Mr Modi, even if the electorate had not. The big question now is whether the downturn will be bad enough to force the prime minister into some of the much-needed reforms that he avoided in his first term. Some changes have started to be made in the past few months.

Initial tweaks in August had little effect, but on September 20th the government abruptly decreed a sharp cut in corporate tax, from an effective rate of 35% to a far more competitive 25%. The move prompted Mumbai‚Äôs biggest stockmarket leap in a decade. The market‚Äôs instant, oversized joy suggests two things. One is that there is a great deal of pent-up energy in the Indian economy, waiting to be released by wiser government policies. The other is that if Mr Modi‚Äôs government puts in some effort, it is capable of coming up with those wiser policies. Businesses are watching to see what will follow. There are rumours of a sweeping privatisation drive. But it is unclear whether Mr Modi‚Äôs reforming side can override his conservatism, which reflexively favours an interventionist state, protectionist trade policies and the opinions of Hindutva trade unions, small business lobbies and ideologues.

Some progress

These tensions played out during Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, which saw the introduction of some welcome reforms. A long-overdue bankruptcy law theoretically reduced the time to settle a business failure from around four years to nine months. The GST did, for all its paperwork, abolish absurd interstate duties and so sped up internal commerce. Fiscal discipline kept inflation modest. Infrastructure‚Äîand in particular power supplies‚Äîimproved substantially. Over the past decade 30m more Indians every year have been connected to the electric grid, which now reaches 90% of all homes. India climbed a stunning 65 places up the World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business Index and pulled in record hauls of foreign investment, totalling more than $35bn in each of the past three years.

Yet the government shied away repeatedly from risking its political capital on deeper structural reforms. Labour laws that make hiring and firing too expensive remained a block to growth, as did laws making it hard for companies to acquire land. Such blockages continue to hamstring efforts to expand India‚Äôs manufacturing base, Chinese-style, to create plentiful low-paid factory jobs for rural migrants. Instead of supporting small business, the government experimented with shock demonetisation, fancy new taxes and heavier enforcement. Rather than promoting trade, it scrapped existing bilateral deals, raised tariffs and sparred with the WTO . Disappointing his own business constituency, Mr Modi dodged calls to privatise some banks, industries and utilities, instead forcing healthy state-owned firms to swallow sick ones.

At the same time, regulators moved too slowly to deal with an urgent problem. Driven by starry forecasts and cronyism under the previous government, state-owned banks had let non-performing loans inflate to a $200bn balloon. Then, caught in the glare of increased scrutiny, they reined in lending, further crimping investment and pushing credit-seekers towards non-banking financial corporations ( NBFC s). In October 2018 a default by one of those caused hiccups across the financial sector. Despite $30bn in government bail-outs for state banks, and a slow decline in non-performing assets, lenders and borrowers remain wary. Though foreign direct investment stayed strong in Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, all but a trickle of the new money poured into services and a few big acquisitions, rather than job- or export-generating industry. The largest single deal saw Walmart, an American retail giant, splash out $16bn for control of Flipkart, an online retailer. The ink had scarcely dried on Walmart‚Äôs cheque before the government radically changed the e-commerce rules that had underpinned Walmart‚Äôs decision to invest. Small traders, who are an important part of the influential Hindutva business lobby, had pressed the government for changes, revealing the kind of obstacles that reforms have to overcome. All the while, talk of Indian growth obscured such facts as declining farmgate prices, stagnant urban wages, flat exports, rising household debt, a long-term decline in savings and investment rates, and flat or falling consumer spending. Some of India‚Äôs top economists did notice the gloomy numbers and realised that since the country‚Äôs statistics agency changed its methodology in 2011, there had been growing divergences between calculations of GDP and a range of other indicators. The doubters, who include Arvind Subramanian, the government‚Äôs chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018, do not suggest foul play but rather poor methodology, compounded by the difficulty of measuring an ‚Äúinformal‚Äù sector that makes up 45% of the economy and accounts for 75% of employment. If the critics are right, growth since 2011 may have been overstated by 2-2.5% a year. As Mr Subramanian notes, the trouble with bungling the numbers is that it is like driving with a faulty speedometer. Indeed, the strongest proof that growth was overstated may be that India appears to have driven off course. The current slump can largely be ascribed to policies followed in the mistaken belief that India was hurtling along at 7-8% annual growth, when the reality was more like 5-6%.

Since the slowdown has taken hold, Ms Sitharaman has scrapped the most onerous of new taxes and compliance rules. She also announced the government would support NBFC s, and top up a range of schemes meant to ease access to export credits and housing loans. Amid a series of rate cuts by the RBI , the government also imposed a slew of mergers between state-owned banks that will, in theory, improve their books and make them keener to lend. The sudden move to slash company taxes came with a further sweetener, a two-year window for new industrial investments to attract a rate of just 17%.

Businesses have broadly welcomed all these moves, as well as having their tax cut by a third, but concerns persist. Though the supply-side tinkering helps, it does not indicate personal attention from Mr Modi, let alone the kind of policy shift many feel is needed to kick-start growth. ‚ÄúThe lack of economic vision baffles me,‚Äù says a conservative think-tank scholar who now regrets voting for Mr Modi. ‚ÄúThey get this monster electoral verdict, and then do nothing?‚Äù

Turning ten stodgy state banks into four bigger ones, for instance, may indeed strengthen the financial sector in the long term. More immediately, though, it ties up the institutions just when the economy needs them. The government promises to buy itself more cars, and to lower interest rates on housing for public servants, but neglects stronger demand-side prods such as rural public works. Ms Sitharaman talks of tweaking export credits and speeding tax reimbursements for exporters, when letting the overvalued rupee drop would boost exports even more. She has chastised tax officers for being overly aggressive, but aside from the cut in corporate rates that simply brings India closer to world averages, has proposed no other bold tax relief. This is badly needed. India has some of the world‚Äôs most convoluted taxes, and enforces them with gusto. GST paperwork is tricky. Rates for some goods are ruinously high. Cement and cars are taxed at 28% (plus hefty further taxes for cars), which is odd if you wish to save manufacturing jobs or spur housing investment. Some personal stories are hair-raising. One luxury-goods executive complains that inspectors invaded his home at gunpoint in the middle of the night and held him and his wife hostage for two days, threatening jail for not co-operating as they poked through his cupboards. They found nothing, but left the businessman shaken. He has decided to leave the country.

Can‚Äôt rely on unicorns

Despite the gouging, the government is faced with a chronic deficit. It pretends this is a mere 3.4%, but after allowing for hidden off-budget liabilities and state debts, overall government borrowing is closer to 9%. August brought a reprieve, with a hefty and controversial dividend payment from the central bank to shore up revenue. But those off-budget fudges, demands from states and shrinking tax receipts will soon start to squeeze the exchequer.

The gloom is not universal. The $180bn IT sector, centred on boomtowns like Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) and Hyderabad, continues to prosper. NASSCOM , an industry body, counted 7,200 start-ups in 2018, of which eight became ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù, valued at over $1bn. Tata Consulting Services passed another milestone for Indian IT firms, reaching a market capital of $100bn. The sector cannot pull the rest of India along, however, and has its own limits. NASSCOM predicts that automation is likely to shrink the number of IT jobs‚Äîcurrently more than 4m‚Äîby some 14% in the next five years.

Population growth, rising productivity and growing aspirations can probably propel a big, diversified economy at a steady 5%. Barring a global crisis, even without ambitious new policies, India may be able to climb out of the current doldrums. Returning to the trajectory of 7-8% growth would take a little longer.

With luck, in a few years‚Äô time, the present slump may be regarded as a useful catalysing moment, like the economic crisis of 1991 that sparked India‚Äôs initial market reforms. But bringing back the brash, risk-taking ebullience of the mid-2000s will not be easy. Many believed Mr Modi when he promised achhe din‚Äîgood times‚Äîin 2014. Starting his second term with a deep slump, he has no one to blame but himself. Worse, say critics, he has no one to turn to. Ms Sitharaman is tough and straight, but her team does not inspire confidence. ‚ÄúWe always had bad institutions, but a few really talented people‚Äîninjas who could go in and make things work,‚Äù says a former finance-ministry mandarin. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs a Trumpian wasteland.‚Äù‚ñ†",https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/10/24/a-downturn-in-india-reveals-the-desperate-need-for-deeper-reform,
The muddle Modi made - Narendra Modi is damaging India‚Äôs economy as well as its democracy,"The country at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms. But he is not acting

S TORIES OF THE clampdown in Jammu & Kashmir and the threat to strip millions of poor and mostly Muslim people in Assam of citizenship, a form of ethnic cleansing by bureaucracy, have seeped into the world‚Äôs consciousness, but many Western businesspeople are still inclined to defend the Indian prime minister. Even if Narendra Modi is bad for democracy, they say, his pro-business philosophy is good for the economy. But, as our special report this week argues, that argument no longer washes. India‚Äôs economy is incompetently managed and doing badly.

Growth fell from 8% in the middle of last year to 5% year-on-year in the most recent quarter. That might not sound too bad, and other emerging economies are also suffering, but India needs to grow fast just to keep its vast workforce fully employed. Worse, the slowdown looks less like a dip than a prolonged cold shower.

Some banks and many other lenders are in crisis, with a $200bn mountain of bad debts. In the six months ending in September, the total flow of financing to businesses fell by 88%. Five successive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, have failed to pull down commercial lending rates, and in any case firms are not investing. Consumer demand has levelled off or fallen, too. Sales of cars and motorbikes have tumbled by 20% or more. And with the combined fiscal deficit of the federal government and the states already approaching 9% of GDP , and tax receipts falling well below expectations, there is little scope for stimulus.

When it first took power in 2014 Mr Modi‚Äôs government inherited an economy with plenty of problems, but it did too little about them. The latest downturn continues that disappointing pattern. With the exception of a steep cut in corporate taxes earlier this month, to 25%, which brings India into line with other countries in the region, the official response has been scattershot and timid. This, say critics, reflects both an unusual paucity of expertise in Mr Modi‚Äôs government and conflicting views in his circle, as competing interest groups vie for his ear. Nevertheless, the outlines of what needs to be done are clear. To start with, Mr Modi should recruit an economic team that is based on competence and experience rather than affinity for the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs Hindu-nationalist ideology. It must tackle both the financial crisis and sagging demand. To fix the banking system, the banks and the lightly regulated shadow banks that have recently been lending heavily need to be stress-tested and, where necessary, the banks recapitalised. Eventually, the state-owned banks could be privatised and the shadow banks put under the same prudential regulations as other lenders. A broader privatisation programme would give the government the money it needs to succour demand. It should make use of levers such as the national rural-employment scheme to get money to the distressed hinterland. In the longer run, the tax system, labour laws, the regulation of land-ownership and fiddly, protectionist tariffs should all be given a thorough overhaul. Many of these items have been on the to-do list of every Indian government for decades. But the long history of stasis only strengthens the case for change. And in Mr Modi, with his vice-like grip on parliament, his reputation as a friend of business and his need to right a foundering economy, India at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms.

The fear is that, instead of getting to grips with the economy, Mr Modi will stop posing as a reformer and fully embrace his alter ego, as a chest-thumping Hindu nationalist. Just months into his second term, he has already abolished India‚Äôs only Muslim-majority state and is threatening to expand to the rest of the country his scheme to hunt down supposed foreign interlopers in Assam. In the face of India‚Äôs growing economic problems, Mr Modi‚Äôs focus on communal grievances seems even more reprehensible. Alas, he may yet draw the opposite conclusion. ‚ñ†",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/24/narendra-modi-is-damaging-indias-economy-as-well-as-its-democracy,
A big stink on the brink - The risks from India‚Äôs rotten banks,"I MAGINE A CENTRAL bank tweeting that, yes, there are rumours of ‚Äúcertain‚Äù banks facing deposit runs but ‚Äúthere is no need to panic‚Äù. Would you feel reassured? That is the unenviable position Indians found themselves in last week as a financial storm rumbled on in the world‚Äôs fifth-biggest economy with no sign of the authorities getting a firm grip. In the latest fiasco a co-operative bank, PMC , is accused of fraud, prompting depositors to yank their cash out. Meanwhile shares in Yes Bank, a private lender, have collapsed by 40% in the past month as rumours swirl. These are not isolated incidents. Roughly a third of the financial system is on crutches or under suspicion. Dazed by the scale of the task, the government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) are dithering. Until they act, India‚Äôs economy will not perk up‚Äîand there is a danger of a full-blown crisis.

The origins of this mess go back to 2005. In the first phase conventional banks, which control about four-fifths of the system‚Äôs assets and are mostly state-run, lent too freely to infrastructure and industrial projects, sometimes ones backed by well-connected tycoons. The plight today is a continuation of the second phase: a boom-and-bust in lightly regulated shadow banks, which control the remaining fifth of the system. The danger grew in 2016 when the government temporarily abolished large banknotes, leading many people to deposit money in banks and mutual funds. These, in turn, used the windfall to make loans to shadow banks, which went on their own lending binge, often using the money to finance property projects.

Today the financial system is stuffed with bad debts. Perhaps a tenth of loans are dud, maybe more. The shadow banks are vulnerable because they use short-term debt (rather than ordinary deposits, which they are mostly restricted from raising) to fund long-term loans of their own. There is also an undercurrent of fraud and bogus accounting. In 2018 Punjab National Bank said that a diamond dealer had stolen $2bn from it. Later that year IL&FS , a big shadow bank with government links, collapsed. Credit-rating agencies have been giving high ratings to flaky firms. With suspicion rife, a handful of shadow banks face a severe funding squeeze, and the entire financial sector is wary of lending. As a result credit is growing at near its slowest pace in 20 years. The ripple effect has stalled building projects, starved wholesalers of loans to buy inventory and prevented farmers from borrowing to buy tractors and motorbikes.",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/10/the-risks-from-indias-rotten-banks,
Reviving India‚Äôs economy - Modi‚Äôs mission,"INDIA, a giant economic mediocrity, is cursed by having too many economists. Its outgoing prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has a doctorate from Oxford, ran the central bank in the 1980s and led the liberalisation programme that India put in place in 1991 after a currency crisis. Yet as prime minister Mr Singh had little grip or public support, serving at the pleasure of Sonia Gandhi, the populist leader of the Congress party. By the end of his ten-year term he admitted he had failed. In August, as the rupee tumbled, he addressed a gathering of India‚Äôs policymaking elite at his house in Delhi. The economy faced ‚Äúvery difficult circumstances‚Äù, he whispered.

Mr Singh‚Äôs successor could not be more different. Narendra Modi‚Äôs economic views have been formed while running the business-friendly state of Gujarat for the past 12 years. Asked some time ago about his economic influences, he described his homespun framework, jotting diagrams on a pad as he spoke. He has studied Singapore and China, but thinks that ‚ÄúIndia is a democracy and has different requirements‚Äù. Striking a balance between farming, small firms and global companies is required, with limited but muscular administration and populist appeal: ‚ÄúMen, machines and money must work together.‚Äù

Having run Gujarat well, Mr Modi now faces the far harder task of running India. He has big advantages‚Äîadministrative competence, control over his party and a majority in Parliament‚Äîthat should ease decision-making. Unlike Mr Singh, he has also campaigned and won on a platform of aspiration and economic reform. India needs ‚Äúless government and more governance‚Äù, he declared on the campaign trail.

The immediate situation is precarious, notwithstanding a post-election surge in the stockmarket. India suffers from stagflation. Growth is 4-5%, half the level at the peak, inflation is 9% and rising (see chart), industrial production is declining and the public finances are a mess. Although the current-account deficit has narrowed to below 2% of GDP, it is flattered by a de facto ban on gold imports and could yet blow out to scary levels again.

As The Economist went to press Mr Modi had not picked his finance minister. The front-runners are Arun Shourie, a journalist and ex-minister, and Arun Jaitley, an urbane stalwart of Mr Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party. Both are able. As well as dealing with the immediate mess, Mr Modi and his finance minister must grapple with India‚Äôs long-term trajectory. It is distinctly wobbly. A decade ago the country seemed destined to rival China. Annual growth was heading towards 10%. India had the ingredients that had made East Asian countries richer: a growing population and rates of saving and investment of over 30% of GDP that would finance factories and roads, lifting the economy‚Äôs potential. Unlike most East Asian counties, India has never had a strong state, but instead, optimists argued, it had brilliant entrepreneurs who could wheel and deal the country to prosperity. What went wrong? The raw inputs of growth‚Äîpeople and capital‚Äîhave been deployed badly. The rates of savings and investment have dipped and their mix has deteriorated. High inflation has led households to buy gold, shifting money away from the banking system where it can be productively employed. And a mixture of bureaucracy, excessive leverage, incompetence and corruption has led private companies (whose spending tends to have the most bang per rupee) to halve their investments as a share of GDP. What has been invested has often been tangled in red tape and graft. India‚Äôs improvised miracle has hit its limits. Energy and chaos only go so far. Although poverty has fallen and there are pockets of dazzling wealth, much of the economy is primitive. Infrastructure is decades behind China‚Äôs. Industries that are close to the state involve corruption on a grand scale, with bribes paid to politicians and officials over the past half decade of anywhere between $4 billion and $12 billion. Only 3% of Indians pay income tax, leaving a hole in government finances.

About 90% of jobs are informal, leading to widespread poverty. Agriculture is feudal and food shortages cause inflation. India is meant to be industrialising but manufacturing contributes only 15% of GDP and 11% of jobs, and its share has been falling. A majority of India‚Äôs 50m manufacturing workers toil in facilities without electricity. A droopy rupee means India has been running to stand still. At market exchange rates India‚Äôs GDP remains smaller than Italy‚Äôs and ranks tenth in the world, about the same as in the 1980s.

There may be no one better qualified than the forceful Mr Modi to kick-start the investment cycle and slay stagflation. In his first month Mr Modi will beef up the prime minister‚Äôs office and knock heads together to get stalled projects moving. Some are embroiled in legal disputes which he will not be able to override; others are a matter for state governments. But still others are easy pickings. Roads, rail, coal and gas are areas where a decisive central government will make a difference, says Sanjeev Prasad, of Kotak, a bank.

Cometh the hour, cometh the man

In his first quarter in office he must tackle the bloated fiscal deficit, which has fuelled high inflation. Book-cooking by the outgoing government means that the true deficit is higher than official forecasts‚Äîat perhaps 7-8% of GDP (including the states). Mr Modi will trim spending on wasteful subsidies of fuel and food and defer the rolling out of welfare schemes passed by the last government in its dying days. A budget will offer a chance to reverse the previous government‚Äôs retroactive tax claim on Vodafone, India‚Äôs largest foreign investor. Doing so would soothe the nerves of foreign firms.

In his first year, Mr Modi must stabilise India‚Äôs rotten banks and tame inflation. Recapitalising state-run lenders will cost up to 5% of GDP and will involve taking on the bureaucracies that run them and the powerful industrialists who are sitting on bankrupt projects that need to be written off. It will be a test of Mr Modi‚Äôs resolve. Another test will be his stance on interest rates. The boss of the central bank, Raghuram Rajan, wants a tough new inflation-targeting regime. Mr Modi should back Mr Rajan, who is keen to stay in his job. After all, high inflation is partly why Congress lost.

A good first year will revive animal spirits. Ajay Piramal, a tycoon with a billion dollars in gross cash, is now looking to invest again. The election result is ‚Äúa good sign of the maturing of the electorate,‚Äù he says. Within two years the economy could be growing at close to its potential rate. Chetan Ahya of Morgan Stanley, a bank, forecasts growth of 6.8% by the quarter ending in March 2016. If Mr Modi achieves all this, he will have done the easy part.

In the long term he must raise India‚Äôs growth rate towards 10% and ensure that expansion starts to generate decent jobs. You do not become a superpower by creating an ever bigger army of underemployed drivers, idle security guards and ragged peons. India‚Äôs median age is 26, and every year for the next decade 10m people will enter the workforce. That requires a new vision for India and deeper reforms.

Critics argue that this is a step Mr Modi will be unable to make, and that he offers only a limited form of crony capitalism, with chummy deals struck with tycoons. This is unfair: many firms in Gujarat say that the bureaucracy works well, that the courts are fast and that graft is non-existent. The state has some impressive bureaucrats, ministers and institutions.

In any case India‚Äôs new economic plan will have to be home-grown, because simple prescriptions do not work. Outsiders often argue that all India needs to do is open up its economy and shrink its public sector. But the state is too puny in many ways: it is unable to enforce contracts and cannot afford to spend enough on infrastructure. The big impediment to foreign investment is not legal restrictions (most sectors are already open) but the same nightmarish business conditions that annoy local firms.

What might Mr Modi‚Äôs long-term plan look like? Some things are obvious. The solution to India‚Äôs fiscal problem (it has not run a budget surplus since independence in 1947) is to expand the tax net. A proposed direct-tax code, and a goods-and-services tax (GST), should achieve this. With more revenue, the state can build more infrastructure: the experiment over the past decade of getting the private sector to do the heavy lifting has had mixed results. The GST also helps make India a single market by replacing a myriad of local levies. The bureaucracy needs to be reformed; Bimal Jalan, a former central-bank governor, says the number of ministries should be cut.

But the big question is whether Mr Modi can make India a global hub for labour-intensive manufacturing. Japan, South Korea and China got richer by employing unskilled farmers in factories. The timing is perfect for India. Labour costs are rising in China; Japanese firms are shifting production from China because of military tensions; and the rupee has fallen, making Indian workers more competitive.

Sadly, it is hard to find an Asian boss who is interested. William Fung of Li & Fung, the world‚Äôs biggest sourcer of clothes for Western retailers, says activity is shifting to Bangladesh, South-East Asia and Africa. Zhang Ruimin, of Haier, a big manufacturer of household appliances, says he wants to automate his factories in China. Fujio Mitarai, the boss of Canon, plans to tilt production back to Japan and also automate it. When India is mentioned he raises his eyebrows.

About half of China‚Äôs exports are made by foreign firms. India could try relying on indigenous manufacturers instead. But they usually prefer to use machines, not employ people. They are also subscale. Mahindra & Mahindra, India‚Äôs local car champion, has a research-and-development budget that is 1% of Volkswagen‚Äôs.

Some argue that India could rely on a ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù effect from its sophisticated IT, pharmaceutical and high-tech manufacturing industries. They employ only a few million people but generate exports worth 7% of GDP. As the owners and staff of these firms spend the value added they have earned, they might create jobs.

It may be possible on paper, but some are sceptical that trickle-down can deliver a widespread improvement in living standards quickly. Arvind Panagariya, an economist Mr Modi listens to, argues that such an approach will not transform India. ‚ÄúManufacturing is of the highest priority‚Ä¶In ten or 15 years‚Äô time India ought to be where China is today.‚Äù

Narendra the great mender

Can Mr Modi achieve this? In a technical sense he will have to transform the supply of the inputs of production. Most factories find it far too hard to get land, labour and energy. All three inputs are bound by a mesh of restrictive rules and bureaucracy, vested interests and corruption. One option would be to devolve power over these matters to the states, and hope that they compete among each other to raise standards, much as Gujarat has done. Another would be for Mr Modi to build momentum over several years for a wholesale recasting of the rules, driven by the centre. Either way, it will require nothing less than a complete change of outlook for a country that has forgotten how to do business simply.

Sitting at his desk in Gujarat, Mr Modi said that when he first took charge of the state‚Äôs economy, ‚ÄúI thought: the sky is the limit.‚Äù A similar ambition today would serve India well.",https://www.economist.com/briefing/2014/05/24/modis-mission,
Bullock cart or locomotive? - A deceptive tweet casts doubt on the Indian government‚Äôs credibility,"N OTHING HURRIES governments more than an approaching election. But sometimes, as Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs minister of railways, recently found, haste can cause accidents. Keen to tout the Vande Bharat Express, a fast new service, he posted a clip that showed the made-in-India train roaring through a station at a blinding pace. As eagle-eyed viewers swiftly noted, however, the film had been altered to run at double speed. Jokesters quickly counter-posted a cascade of mockingly accelerated footage, including a lightning-fast bullock cart zooming along a dirt track.

With a general election looming in April it is not just pictures, but dreary statistics that the government has been accused of doctoring. Indian opposition parties have often charged their rivals in power with massaging official data. But since the landslide victory of Narendra Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014, critics claim, the practice has become commonplace.

In January two of the five members of the body that vets official statistics resigned in protest, after the government blocked release of what many consider the most accurate indicator of unemployment. The numbers were soon leaked, and to no one‚Äôs surprise they showed an embarrassing rise, to a 45-year high of 6.1%.

Other numbers have also sown suspicion. Soon after taking office Mr Modi‚Äôs government announced it would revise the official method of calculating GDP and rebase the data to a new year. Frequently since then, economists have puzzled over numbers that consistently show stronger growth than seems justified by other indicators. They also seem strangely impervious to obvious shocks, such as Mr Modi‚Äôs banning in 2016 of all currency bills worth more than 100 rupees ($1.41), or the imposition of a stiff sales tax with no fewer than seven separate rates and laborious forms for businesses to fill in.

In November, after an inexplicable three-year delay, the government‚Äôs number-wallahs released a new back series for GDP growth according to the new methodology. To some surprise, considering that the noughties are recalled as an era of unprecedented boom, the new statistics showed Mr Modi‚Äôs government smartly outperforming its predecessor.

Sceptics abound, as do theories of how and how far the government‚Äôs numbers stray from the truth. Some blame flawed adjustments for inflation. Arun Kumar, an economist, argues that the government‚Äôs estimates of the growth of the informal economy, which accounts for nine in ten jobs and perhaps 45% of GDP , presume too strong a correlation with the formal economy. Mr Kumar argues that it is quite possible for the easily measured, tax-paying part of the economy to be growing by 7%, even as the less perceptible poor are quietly suffering. Taking into account such drags as Mr Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonetisation‚Äù, the shrinking of credit and a prolonged and continuing slump in farm prices, Mr Kumar suspects that the informal economy may in fact be contracting‚Äîsomething that would substantially reduce overall growth.",https://www.economist.com/asia/2019/02/16/a-deceptive-tweet-casts-doubt-on-the-indian-governments-credibility,
The week in charts - India‚Äôs democracy in danger,"Our cover leader this week argues that Narendra Modi, India‚Äôs prime minister, and his Bharatiya Janata Party are creating sectarian divisions that imperil the world‚Äôs biggest democracy. The BJP, which increased its parliamentary majority last May despite a slowing economy, has pursued a Hindu-nationalist agenda. A citizenship law, passed last month, makes it easier for long-term immigrants to naturalise as Indians‚Äîif they are not Muslims. Mr Modi also wants to create a register of citizens, which would oblige Indians to provide evidence of citizenship; many Muslims do not have the necessary papers, so risk being made stateless. But Mr Modi is meeting resistance. The citizenship law sparked protests that have lasted weeks. He could have used his parliamentary power to pass badly needed economic reforms; yet, our Briefing concludes, he has created a broad coalition against himself.

A polite crowd of 22,000 gathered in Richmond, Virginia, on January 20th to protest against gun-control measures proposed by the state‚Äôs Democrat-controlled legislature. (Fears of a repeat of a far-right rally in Charlottesville, also in Virginia, in 2017, in which a counter-protester was killed, came to nothing.) The proposals are mainly modest; the most controversial would allow relatives or the police to petition a court to take away the guns of someone who may be dangerous. Yet many protesters suspect a wider confiscation plan. The rally reflects a widening political division: as suburbs around Richmond and Washington, DC, have grown, Virginia has become more Democratic, even while the rest of the state has leaned more Republican.

Despite the lowest unemployment for 50 years, during Donald Trump‚Äôs presidency America‚Äôs budget deficit has widened from 4% to 5.5%, by far the largest of any rich country. It may get wider still. That means issuing lots of debt‚Äîbut as we report this week, America is having no trouble finding buyers. American companies and households are saving more and investing in Treasuries; post-crisis regulations oblige banks to buy more safe, liquid assets. Europeans are the keenest foreign buyers, although some Chinese purchases may be made (believe it or not) by Belgian intermediaries. Low interest rates and inflation may allow America‚Äôs fiscal looseness to continue. That doesn‚Äôt necessarily make it wise.

At first glance Europe may look certain to become more reliant on Russian gas. Its own production is declining, whereas Russian supply (37% of the market in 2018) is rising and new pipelines from the east are coming. This month one, TurkStream, was launched; American sanctions will delay another, Nord Stream 2, but not halt it. Yet the European Commission believes Europe has become less vulnerable in the past decade, thanks to rising competition. Renewables have supplanted some gas, and imports of liquefied natural gas have doubled since 2017. LNG has spawned a spot market, which has in turn loosened the rigid oil-linked pricing favoured by Gazprom, Russia‚Äôs giant state-owned supplier. None of this means Europe is free of Gazprom, whose market share is likely to decline only slightly in the next few years. But LNG has made it harder to fleece pipeline customers.",https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/01/24/indias-democracy-in-danger,
The missing 235m - Why India needs women to work,"LAKSHMI, the goddess of wealth and fortune, is the closest thing Hinduism has to an economic deity. How poorly her earthly sisters in present-day India are faring. There, women are less likely to work than they are in any country in the G20, except for Saudi Arabia. They contribute one-sixth of economic output, among the lowest shares in the world and half the global average. The unrealised contribution of women is one reason India remains so poor.

Yet far from joining the labour force, women have been falling away at an alarming pace. The female employment rate in India, counting both the formal and informal economy, has tumbled from an already-low 35% in 2005 to just 26% now. In that time the economy has more than doubled in size and the number of working-age women has grown by a quarter, to 470m. Yet nearly 10m fewer women are in jobs. A rise in female employment rates to the male level would provide India with an extra 235m workers, more than the EU has of either gender, and more than enough to fill all the factories in the rest of Asia.

Imagine the repercussions. Were India to rebalance its workforce in this way, the IMF estimates, the world‚Äôs biggest democracy would be 27% richer. Its people would be well on their way to middle-income status. Beyond the obvious economic benefits are the incalculable human ones. Women who work are likelier to invest more in their children‚Äôs upbringing, and to have more say over how they lead their lives. Given that more Indian women have been beaten up by their husbands than are in work, there is room for improvement.

Rich irony

The first step in reversing the dramatic drop in female employment is understanding it (see Briefing). Some of the fall is a sign of progress. Girls are staying in school, and thus out of the labour force, for longer. But mostly it is the result of two unwelcome trends. As households become richer, they prefer women to stop working outside the home. It is not unusual in developing economies for a family‚Äôs social standing to be enhanced by having its women remain at home. But India stands out, as its female labour-force participation rate is well below those of countries at comparable income levels.

Social mores are startlingly conservative. A girl‚Äôs first task is to persuade her own family that she should have a job. The in-laws she will typically move in with after marriage are even more likely to yank her out of the workforce and into social isolation. In a survey in 2012, 84% of Indians agreed that men have more right to work than women when jobs are scarce. Men have taken 90% of the 36m additional jobs in industry India has created since 2005. And those who say that women themselves prefer not to work must contend with plenty of counter-evidence. Census data suggest that a third of stay-at-home women would work if jobs were available; government make-work schemes attract more women than men.

That points to the other problem: the lack of employment opportunities. The workforce has shifted from jobs more often done by women‚Äîespecially farming, where most Indian women work but are being displaced by mechanisation. At the same time, inflexible and unreformed labour markets have hampered the rise of manufacturing and low-level services, the gateway for women in other poor countries. In neighbouring Bangladesh, whose customs are not so different from India‚Äôs, a boom in garment manufacturing has increased the number of working women by 50% since 2005. In Vietnam three-quarters of women work. But the mega-factories that boosted female employment there are largely absent in India.

Men, to your mops

What can be done? Many of the standard answers fall short. Promoting education, a time-tested development strategy, may not succeed. Figures show that the more schooling an Indian woman receives, the less likely she is to work, at least if she has anything less than a university degree. Likewise urbanisation, another familiar way to alleviate poverty: city-dwelling women are half as likely as rural ones to have a job.

Promoting female-friendly workplace policies, such as generous maternity leave, goes only so far in a country where most workers operate outside the formal economy. The most fruitful policy would be to reform India‚Äôs labour market so that women can be sucked into jobs en masse. When hiring and firing decisions have to be validated by bureaucrats, few entrepreneurs want to set up large factories.

A huge amount can be achieved in the intimacy of people‚Äôs homes without any help from the deskwallahs in Delhi. Indian women do 90% of the housework, the most of any large country. Gentlemen, spending just two hours a week doing the dishes or putting the kids to bed, would translate into a ten percentage point increase in female labour participation, according to a World Bank study. If that raised GDP by $550bn, as the McKinsey Global Institute, a think-tank, has suggested, it would surely be the easiest half-trillion-dollar boost available to the global economy‚Äîand to one of its poorest countries, too.

An optimist might argue that more women are not working because India is still paying for the sins of the past, when so many of them were illiterate and high fertility rates bound them to the home. Most measures of female welfare are improving. India has many more girls in classrooms and fewer child brides than it once did.

But simply waiting for that progress to trickle down into the labour market ignores India‚Äôs dismal recent record. The socially conservative bent of the Hindu-nationalist government of Narendra Modi makes it an unlikely champion of women‚Äôs rights. Other countries are trying harder to get women into gainful employment. Unless something changes, it will not be long before Saudi women are more common in the workplace than Indian ones.

In fact, many fear that all that extra schooling was a parental ploy to improve a daughter‚Äôs prospects not in the labour market but in the arranged-marriage market, part of the all-important quest to snag a suitable boy. A further push is needed to get Indian women what they really need: a suitable job.",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/07/05/why-india-needs-women-to-work,

By the summer, upon completion of a three-month nursing course, she hopes to start as a bedside assistant in a hospital in Kapurthala, a town near her village in the northern Indian state of Punjab. In a windowless classroom bedecked with medical diagrams, she and a dozen others are learning the difference between a stethoscope and an endoscope.

Ms Kaur would rather not act as a pioneer among her peers. But her father, a labourer on building sites, has heart problems, her mother is dead and her sisters live with their husbands‚Äô families. Financial necessity and the prospect of a 5,000 rupees ($73) monthly pay cheque trumped any patriarchal hesitation her father had about her new path. After several years at home since finishing school, the putative nurse thinks she might enjoy it, too.

Everything suggests that Indian women ought to be following Ms Kaur into the workplace. The economy has grown at around 7% a year for two decades, girls are now far better educated than their mothers and fertility rates have dropped rapidly. Such dynamics sucked millions of women into the labour force in other poor countries. Excluding India the proportion of women who work worldwide is 50% (see chart 1). But in India, it has declined from 35% in 2005 to 26% today. No country has experienced such a steep decline, and from a low level to boot.

India‚Äôs bid to become a middle-income country hinges on the likes of Ms Kaur. India, soon to become the world‚Äôs most populous country, now stands at 121st out of 131 countries ranked by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) for female participation in the workforce. Across the world, some 700m more women would be working if their employment rates matched that of men. A third of those, or 235m, would be in India. Even if India had maintained the rate of 2005, that would have translated into a further 42m workers. That is not far from the number employed in all Indian manufacturing. China, whose footsteps to relative prosperity it aches to follow, has barely more men working than India. Despite a drop as workplace participation dipped for both men and women, its overall workforce is nearly 50% bigger thanks to many more women working. What prompted the drop? Part of the fall in the number of working women is actually good news. Indian girls are staying in school longer. Research suggests that it explains perhaps a third of the decline in the participation rate, which counts all females aged 15 and above. (But a startling gender gap remains: some 49% of women between 15 and 24 years old are not in education, employment or training, compared with just 8% for boys.) This learning spurt would be good news if girls used it to secure jobs. But a paradox of present-day India is that the more education a girl gets, the less likely she is to work, bar the few that continue their studies past school. Various studies have found a ‚ÄúU-shape‚Äù relationship between educational attainment and workforce participation (see chart 2).

Illiterate women, often from society‚Äôs poorest segments, have little choice but to work. Most end up doing what amounts to subsistence farming. Two-thirds of India‚Äôs population live in the countryside and agriculture accounts for over half all female employment. As family incomes rise, women get more education, but upon completing their studies are excused from drudgery in favour of tending home. This would have been the fate of Ms Kaur, who has 12 years of schooling to her name. The trend reverses only with the small number of highly educated women.

From farm to plating up

Patriarchal social mores supersede economic opportunity in a way more usually associated with Middle Eastern countries. Outside a small urban elite, the default position is for women not to work unless there is no other way for a family to make ends meet. This reflects an enduring stigma of women being seen as ‚Äúhaving‚Äù to toil. A family‚Äôs social standing partly derives from women being able to stay at home. Such social restrictions become more rigid higher up the caste hierarchy.

The likelihood of a woman working is, in essence, inversely related to her family‚Äôs income‚Äîat a time when families are getting richer. Vast discrepancies exist between Indian states. In places where many men have migrated to cities leaving wives behind, such as in the hilly north-east of the country, female employment rates are relatively high. In places like Punjab, and in much of the populous and conservative Hindi Belt it abuts in the north of the country, the figure is below 15%.

The most marked chasm is between urban and rural areas. Women in cities are about half as likely to work as those outside them. The gap is declining only because rural women are falling out of the labour force. Between 2005 and 2012, the rural female labour-force participation rate declined from 49% to 36%. In urban areas, the figure stayed around 20%. Because India‚Äôs population is steadily migrating to cities, this gap is depressing participation. Cities have fewer farming jobs, which are among the only ones that allow women to work and to take care of children.

Even those women who want to work face plenty of obstacles. Harpreet Kaur of the Pratham Institute, the charity co-ordinating the nursing course in Kapurthala, says getting girls to sign up is the hardest part of her job. A village leader must first give permission for girls living there to be trained, which is forthcoming just half the time. Then parents are approached. Only if they agree is the potential trainee asked her opinion.

Even after training for and getting a job few stick around. Data from Rohini Pande and others at Harvard University suggest that less than 20% of the girls who finish the kind of courses offered by Pratham (as well as nursing, it offers training for beauticians) will still be working a year later. That is roughly half the figure for men doing similar courses. The most oft-cited reason for girls dropping out is family obligations.

Marriage is what nips many careers in the bud. Most girls on Pratham courses say they would like to keep working after they get married. Almost none of them do so. Many badger their parents to find a match who will allow it (nearly nine in ten marriages in India are arranged). In practice, only 10-15% get the opportunity, says Ms Kaur. ‚ÄúIt is totally frustrating. But if the husband has a good job, the question becomes ‚Äòwhy work?‚Äô‚Äù, she says. Indian women are not expected to have a job‚Äî41% of young Indians think it better if married women do not work. As the median age of marriage is 19, there is little time to experience the workplace. It does not mean a life of idleness. Women do 90% of all housework, the highest proportion in the world, soaking up over 40 hours a week.

Why do girls stay in school if they do not intend to get a job? ‚ÄúThere is a trade-off between spending money on educating a girl or spending it on a dowry; education often means a smaller dowry or none at all,‚Äù says Anirudha Dutta, the author of ‚ÄúHalf a Billion Rising: The Emergence of the Indian Woman‚Äù. Dowries are illegal but payments averaging 35,000 rupees remain the norm. As this represents about half a median annual income, keeping a girl in school is a cost-effective way of reducing the bill.

It does not, however, mean a girl can use her education in the workplace. Families scouting for wives for their sons are looking for their own future carers and housemates, given the tradition of brides moving into the in-laws‚Äô family home. Most seek an educated mother for their grandchildren rather than extra income.

Indian women, like their counterparts in most of the world, are having fewer children. They have gone from having an average of four in 1990 to just over two today. But declining fertility has not had the same impact as elsewhere. Western women used the time to build careers; Indian women use it to lavish more attention on fewer kids. According to the World Values Survey, 76% of Indians agree that ‚Äúwhen a mother works for pay, children suffer‚Äù, the highest figure outside the Middle East.

There is evidence that many women want jobs. Census data suggest 31% of stay-at-home women would work if a job were available. When opportunities exist, they are snapped up. A government make-work scheme that guarantees 100 days of paid labour a year for rural Indians has more female participants than male ones.

India‚Äôs cultural barriers to women seeking jobs will be hard to break down. And even if they are removed, some argue it is not clear the country‚Äôs labour market could provide jobs for moderately educated women. There are around 1m new entrants to the labour market every month. They are hardly overwhelmed with job offers, whatever their sex. A recent advertisement for 90,000 railway jobs attracted around 25m applicants.

Nor are female jobseekers likely to have the same chance of success as a man. In a survey in 2012 by Pew, a research outfit, 84% of Indians agreed that ‚Äúwhen jobs are scarce, men should have more right to a job than women‚Äù. The upshot can be seen at the workshop of KR Metal Industries, a small-scale garment manufacturer in an industrial park in Lower Parel, a neighbourhood of Mumbai once known for its teeming textile mills. The scene is reminiscent of countless sweatshops across Asia. Rows of workers are silently hunched over chattering sewing machines, others are ironing or stitching buttons. With one difference: every employee is a man.

Jobs for the boys

The trend extends to nearly all parts of the economy. Less than a quarter of workers in manufacturing are women, compared with nearly half in China. In Brazil 51% of workers in the service sector are women, compared with just 19% in India. Across the world, just under three-quarters of all health-care workers are women, according to the ILO. In India the figure is under half.

Worse, as the Indian economy has grown it has shifted away from female-friendly sectors towards those where men dominate. Since 2005 agriculture has shed 35m of its 250m workers, as tractors and other types of mechanisation reduced the workforce required. Two-thirds of those displaced were women. At the same time employment in industry grew by 36m‚Äîenough to absorb all the redundant farmers, male or female. But men nabbed 90% of those jobs. Of the 56m jobs in the service sector created during the same period, men got nearly 80%. Near the top of the pay scale, hiring in the IT outsourcing industry (which is relatively female-friendly) has all but stalled as its biggest companies face pressures from automation and the prospect of resurgent protectionism.

Industries that spawned tens of millions of female jobs in other emerging economies are largely absent from India. Antiquated labour laws and a government fond of harassing big business are to blame for an absence of mega-factories spewing iPhones or T-shirts. Vietnam and Ethiopia, which have plenty of giant factories employing women, mostly making clothing and footwear, boast female workforce-participation above 70%.

Denying women access to jobs has held back India‚Äôs economy. A study cited by the IMF estimates India would be 27% richer if more women there worked. But the impact runs much deeper. The skewed labour force affects the distribution of wealth between men and women, and thus their respective roles in society.

Neither fine nor balanced

Studies show that women with their own economic resources‚Äîa piece of land, for example‚Äîare far less likely to be victims of domestic violence. And working women are more likely to control household finances. Those who do so spend more on the well-being of their children. The opening of factories where women can find jobs results in an increase in girls‚Äô education in neighbouring districts, and even affects the amount of food they receive.

In a country with pockets of abject poverty, that can have dramatic consequences. Around 600 young girls a day die of neglect resulting from gender bias, according to a study published in the Lancet. The authorities estimate that India has 63m fewer women than it would otherwise because of differing survival rates between boys and girls as well as gender-selective abortions. Across India only 900 girls were born for every 1,000 boys in 2013-15, a ratio that is expected to worsen.

Improving the lot of women who want jobs will be a hard slog. India is hardly fertile ground for feminism. A poll of young Indians last year found over half agreeing that women should always obey their husbands. The patriarchal approach is enthusiastically endorsed by the politically dominant Hindu nationalist movement, spearheaded by Narendra Modi, the prime minister. A female functionary of the women‚Äôs wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the ideological parent of Mr Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party, recently explained that ‚Äúa man‚Äôs job is to make money‚Ä¶whereas a woman‚Äôs quality is motherhood. She should never forget that.‚Äù

Women‚Äôs issues receive limited political attention. A new goods-and-service tax adopted in 2017 put a levy on tampons (while exempting condoms and much else besides). All 33 of the politicians setting the tax rates were men. Only one in eight ministers or members of parliament is a woman; just two of 23 Supreme Court judges are female. The corridors of corporate power are largely men-only zones.

Labour laws that might help women, such as extended maternity leave, have limited scope given that only 5% of women work in formal salaried jobs. Similarly, although men and women should in theory get equal pay for the same work, in practice women get just 62% of what men earn. While women are meant to inherit land as easily as their brothers, few do so in practice. Less than 13% of all agricultural land is controlled by women.

Getting ready for the marriage market or job market?

Allies of Mr Modi insist that his development agenda will help all Indians but women most of all, including helping them into the labour market. Perhaps it will. A push to get gas cookers into 50m homes has exceeded targets, for example. Each cooker can cut the gathering of wood or cow-dung (still used in over half of all households, and mainly foraged by women) by up to an hour a day. A World Bank study suggests that just two hours less housework a week could bump up female employment by ten percentage points.

Women may benefit disproportionately from other schemes, such as those to improve access to bank accounts or mobile phones. Better roads and electricity connections remove obstacles to women getting jobs, studies show, and are part of the government‚Äôs infrastructure push.

Against that, public safety for women remains an oft-cited barrier for employment. Some cities, notably the capital, Delhi, are perceived as inhospitable to single women. That makes moving to find work harder for women than for men, for whom hostels are abundant. In most states, women are barred from overnight shifts at factories for safety reasons.

Optimists point out that countries have their own U-shape of female employment. Women tend to pull out of work as countries move from agriculture to manufacturing and services, but return when more of them get educated. In Turkey female employment slumped then recovered as the country urbanised. The trough of the ‚ÄúU‚Äù is at roughly $10,000 of GDP per head, measured at purchasing-power parity. India, which performs notably worse than countries at similar stages of development, stands at $6,500; the figure is increasing by around $400 a year. That suggests things might get worse before they get better.

The steepest fall in India‚Äôs female-participation rate was between 2005 and 2012, since when things have at least not become much worse (see chart 3). Yet the ILO forecasts that even by 2030 India will not have as many working women as it did in 2005, despite a 44% increase in its female working-age population between those dates.

The goddess of big things

The Hindu goddesses of wealth, power and learning are all women, Mr Dutta points out. But Rama Bijapurkar, a marketing consultant, argues that these are the wrong deities for ambitious Indian women to pray to. Their liberator will instead be the ‚ÄúGoddess EMI‚Äù. Equated monthly instalment is the name given to the loans more and more richer Indians are taking out to finance anything from mobile phones to scooters and homes.

At least among richer Indians, consumer debt is rising rapidly and with it repayments. Increasingly, says Ms Bijapurkar, a single salary is not enough to balance the bloated household budget. That presents an opportunity. For Indian families need not look far for a willing volunteer to bring in a second income. She is in the next room, dealing with a load of washing.",https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/07/05/culture-and-the-labour-market-keep-indias-women-at-home,
Wasting time,"ONE of India‚Äôs bigger private-sector employers can be found in Patna, the capital of Bihar, a poor, populous state in the east of the country. Narendra Kumar Singh, the boss, has three gold rings on his right hand and arms big enough to crush rocks. His firm, Frontline, has 86,000 people on its books. They are mostly unskilled men from rural areas in poor states like Bihar; thanks to Mr Singh they have jobs in cities all over India.

There is lots to celebrate about this. Mr Singh‚Äôs business has sales of $185m and its employee base has grown by 1,600% since 2000. He is looking for a Western partner and wants to expand to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. He is providing paid work for part of the large cohort of young people now entering the workforce. And by shifting people from farms to cities he is helping urbanisation of the sort that underpinned startling progress elsewhere in Asia.

Yet Frontline is also a symptom of a colossal failure. For it is not supplying labour for a manufacturing boom of the kind that helped so many in China, South Korea and Taiwan out of poverty, or for the IT services at which India has excelled. Instead it offers relatively unproductive service-sector jobs‚Äîin particular, security guards. It has become de rigueur for every ATM, office, shop and apartment building to have guards. Across India millions of young men now sit all day on plastic seats in badly fitting uniforms with braids and epaulettes, unshaven and catatonically bored as the economic miracle passes by. This isn‚Äôt how East Asia got rich.

From a bomb to a boom and back

During the boom of the 1990s and 2000s, it became fashionable to talk of India‚Äôs forthcoming ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù. This was quite a turnaround. In the 1960s and 1970s, the booming populations of states like Bihar were seen as a curse. ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb‚Äù, a Malthusian bestseller by two American environmentalists, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, began by describing ‚Äúone stinking hot night in Delhi‚Äù, and its horrifying number of ‚Äúpeople, people, people, people‚Äù. In the 1970s there was a forced sterilisation programme. Sanjay Gandhi, a thuggish scion of the ruling dynasty, organised vasectomy camps near Delhi‚Äîone doctor boasted he could perform 40 sterilisations an hour.

In the 1990s, though, economic liberalisers evoked the experiences of East Asia and the demographic dividend it benefited from when previously high fertility rates began to decline. Working-age populations rose at the same time as the ratio of dependants to workers fell. An associated rise in the rate of saving allowed more investment, helping pay for the vast expansion in manufacturing that employed those workers and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. In the mid2000s the prospect of a similar dividend in India, where the fertility rate had dropped a lot in the 1980s and 1990s, was a key reason for investors‚Äô optimism. The timing was particularly encouraging: India‚Äôs labour force was due to soar as China‚Äôs began to decline (see chart 1).

Now many are worried that India is squandering this demographic opportunity. This is partly because the economy is in a funk. Growth is at 4.5%, half the rate at the peak in the mid-2000s. Industry is 27% of output, compared with 40-47% in other big developing Asian economies. High inflation has prompted households to store ever more of their savings in physical assets rather than the financial system (see chart 2). The costs are clear. With few manufacturing exports, India has a chronic balance-of-payments problem. And India has created too few formal jobs in the past decade.

India‚Äôs leaders have long said they are committed to employment, but have shown little stomach for the economic upheaval rapid job creation entails. China‚Äôs policymakers accepted that the process of adding jobs overall often destroyed jobs in particular industries and places. For years India‚Äôs politicians have preferred economic palliatives such as NREGA, a giant scheme that guarantees work for the rural poor, and subsidies for the needy.

Now India‚Äôs borrowing has soared to queasy levels and welfare spending is being squeezed. There are worries that joblessness could be feeding the spasmodic unrest seen in some cities since 2011. Not all protesters were young. And their motivation varied from support for the anti-corruption guru Anna Hazare to disgust at a series of rapes in Delhi. But the protests added to a sense of youthful volatility.

An official report into the public finances in 2012 warned that a combination of slower growth and the demographic bulge could be ‚Äúpolitically destabilising‚Äù. Rahul Gandhi, who is poised to lead the ruling Congress party in the general election due by 2014, speaks of the ‚Äúangry‚Äù young and their ‚Äúurgent demand for jobs‚Äù. The government‚Äôs economic adviser, Raghuram Rajan, says jobs are the biggest priority. Some in the elite seem to be waking up. But is it too late?

Quantity and quality

To see the scale of the challenge, consider that the working-age population, aged between 15 and 64, will rise by 125m over the coming decade, and by a further 103m over the following decade. On current trends a third of the growth will come from poorer and less literate states in the north, notably Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Not everyone of working age will be in the job market. More people aged 15-24 will remain in education‚Äî26% do today. Some adult women will stay at home; presently only about a third work, a low level by Asian standards. But India probably needs to create about 100m net new jobs in the next decade.

China‚Äôs boom created 130m net jobs in services and industry between 2002 and 2012. But India is no China. The most recent survey showed no net new jobs were created between 2004-05 and 2009-10, a dramatic slowdown on the previous five years, when 60m jobs were created.

These figures may not be as shocking as they seem. Fewer jobs were created partly because some folk voluntarily withdrew from the workforce. More women in rural areas decided not to look for jobs‚Äîperhaps because several fairly good years for farmers meant they did not need the cash. Wages for the unskilled have been rising, and though this is partly because of the NREGA guaranteed-work scheme, it suggests there has not been a collapse in the jobs market. For all these caveats, though, the headline data remain disquieting. Even during a boom few jobs were created. Now that the economy is growing more slowly things have got harder.

The rural poor seem likely to be frustrated, which will add to the number of migrants headed for the cities. The better-educated will suffer, too. By some estimates India produces twice as many new graduates each year as it can absorb. In a half-built private-run campus in Patna most students have modest expectations of their future salaries‚Äîtypically $500 a month. Even so, their professor worries they won‚Äôt all get job offers.

The problem lies not just in the quantity of jobs, though; quality matters too. Statistics verify what the naked eye can see in any Indian city. They all have their armies of guards, peons, delivery boys, ear-dewaxers and men who sit on stools in lifts pressing the buttons. About 85% of India‚Äôs jobs are with ‚Äúinformal‚Äù enterprises‚Äîthose organisations with fewer than ten staff which are not incorporated. Another 11% are casual jobs with formal companies. Only 16% of Indians say they get a regular wage. People with informal jobs are usually very poor. An official study of 2004-05 data concludes that 80% of informal workers got less than the then national minimum wage of $1.46 a day. There are some good jobs. But India‚Äôs IT firms, for example, account for only a few million jobs out of a total of half a billion.

All this seems to be closely linked to the lack of manufacturing. Although some 23% of Indian workers are categorised as working in ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, compared to nearly 30% in China and 22% in Indonesia, half of India‚Äôs ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù workers are in construction whereas the figure is just a quarter in Indonesia. Of the remainder almost all are in the ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù subcategory. But these are not jobs that involve exposure to modern machinery, techniques and training (crucial for unskilled labour let down by the country‚Äôs education system). More than half of Indians in the manufacturing sector work in facilities without electricity.

The obvious problem is a ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù. Most of the jobs are in tiny operations. Most of the value added is in a few big, sophisticated firms that prefer using machines to humans. Some, such as Tata Sons and Mahindra, are well-known. Most of those seem keener on expanding globally than on building factories at home. For every dollar of foreign direct investment (FDI) made by outsiders in Indian manufacturing in the five years to March 2012, local firms invested 65 cents in manufacturing abroad. The number of jobs in factories (excluding the very smallest) has increased since 2005; but only by 2.8m.

What manufacturing FDI India does attract tends to be high-end‚ÄîVolkswagen has a smart ‚Ç¨570m plant full of robots. Meanwhile investment is pouring into Vietnam and Indonesia (see chart 3) as costs in China rise. Li & Fung, a big trading firm based in Hong Kong which buys goods in Asia and sells them in the West to retailers including Walmart, gets some 5% of its goods from India, compared with about 20% from South-East Asia.

Death on the shop floor

India‚Äôs missed opportunity is most evident in textiles and clothing, a labour-intensive industry that has been dominated by China. In 2011 McKinsey, a consultancy, found that purchasing managers at global clothing firms wanted to shift their sourcing from China; their favoured new destinations included Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia‚Äîbut not India. India‚Äôs textile exports have grown, but those from Vietnam and Bangladesh, combined, easily outstrip them.

Why don‚Äôt more people want to make things in India? Indian migrant workers are sought across the world, not least in the Gulf. But at home tricky labour relations are a problem.

In a dusty lawyers‚Äô room in the industrial belt near Delhi, five workers explain how they were fired by Maruti Suzuki, a carmaker controlled by Suzuki of Japan, after simmering tensions on the shop floor led to a riot at a nearby plant in July 2012. A manager was burned to death. The men are in their 20s and from rural families. They have a strong sense of injustice. ‚ÄúWe have told our families that they should consider us as behind bars and that they should make other plans for their lives. We are ready for a long fight.‚Äù The Maruti violence has so far been a one-off. But the episode unnerved businesspeople.

Economists have long identified arcane labour laws as the key to India‚Äôs manufacturing problem. Scholars have gleefully dissected India‚Äôs 51 central and 170 state labour statutes, some of which pre-date independence, to demonstrate how they make it hard for firms with more than a handful of staff to fire people and allow disputes to become legal endurance tests. Studies have shown how tighter rules impede growth in labour-intensive industries and prompt firms to remain small.

Two-tier world

Yet the industrial belt in which Maruti‚Äôs factory sits shows times have changed. Big firms can bypass labour law by using ‚Äúcontract‚Äù workers, technically employed by third-party agents. In the past decade they have used‚Äîor, workers say, abused‚Äîthis kink in the rules a lot more. At three car and motorbike plants, based on discussions with workers, about 70% of 14,500 staff work on a contract basis. Their average wage is $5-6 per working day, a quarter of what permanent, unionised staff get. The minimum wage in Guangzhou, a Chinese industrial hub, is $10.5 per working day.

That might appear to be good news. If lots of factory workers can be hired at globally competitive rates, on flexible terms, manufacturing firms should pile into India. In practice the situation is unstable. As the Maruti riot showed, the two-tier workforce has caused anger‚Äîthe five men in the lawyers‚Äô room were permanent employees who say they were disgusted by the treatment of their contract colleagues. Maruti is abandoning the distinction. And from a financial perspective the contract system is not as good as it looks for employers. They must still hire unionised permanent staff, and though these may be in a minority they can account for the majority of a plant‚Äôs wage bill, lifting the average pay across all workers to Chinese levels.

The labour situation is a long way from the strikes and militancy of the 1970s, but it is unpredictable. That puts off potential manufacturers. And there are lots of other deterrents, too, from red tape to erratic electricity (see, for example, the monumental blackout across north and east India in 2012), a lack of land, bad roads and busy ports. One shipping boss thinks logistics add 20% to the cost of making something in India, compared with 6-8% in China. The Middle Kingdom hardly excelled on such metrics 20 years ago, but India does seem to be especially intimidating for industrial firms. Where non-labour problems have been tackled, notably in Gujarat, manufacturing does better. But Gujarat‚Äîpopulation 60m‚Äîis not a big state by Indian standards.

Since 2000 India has tried carving out special economic zones (SEZs) to create islands with lower taxes and access to infrastructure, where manufacturers can feel at home. But these have been a limited success, with many dominated by IT firms. A new twist is a proposed industrial corridor between Delhi and Mumbai, inspired by the expressway between Seoul and Busan in South Korea. The project has Japanese support, but basic things such as access to land and water have yet to be settled.

In its frustration India is flirting with a more overt industrial policy. A new rule says that government offices must now buy computers with a chunk of components made locally. This is designed to improve the balance of payments and promote an indigenous industry. The government is also now offering subsidies that could be worth billions of dollars to attract a microchip foundry. There is a push to indigenise the defence industry.

The legislation on offer to try to change the situation more generally may not enthuse industry. There are noises about labour-law reform, but rather than liberalise the regime for permanent workers it may merely tighten the one for contract employees. A bill that is supposed to make it easier to buy land could make the process even more expensive and protracted, argue many businesspeople.

For robust jobs growth there must be a change of mindset among officials, judges and politicians. Although Mr Gandhi and others are talking about the challenge, not everyone is, partly due to the electoral system‚Äôs skew towards the countryside. Only 10% of legislators in the lower house have urban constituencies in which 75% or more of the population is urban, reckons the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a think-tank. Jobs in factories in cities are not a priority for most politicians.

Failing gently

Could the voices of the young change this? There is a rising level of political involvement. A recent survey by CSDS and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a German think-tank, found that nearly twice as many of today‚Äôs 18- to 33-year-olds say they are interested in politics as did in 1996. Some 20% of young rural men say they participate in protests, as do 22% of college-educated young men. Those with exposure to the media, from talk shows to social media, are most politically active. One of India‚Äôs big mobile-messaging sites, Nimbuzz, with 25m mostly young users, says traffic doubled in the aftermath of the rape scandal in Delhi in December and during the Anna Hazare anti-graft protests. But the young have little independent political identity; their party allegiance is much like that of their parents. Nor do they have any obvious muscle.

The lack of political resolve and of a clear signal from voters mean India is unlikely to summon up the single-minded dedication with which South Korea, Taiwan and China created industrial jobs. Its demographic dividend will yield only a fraction of what it could, and the problem of low-quality employment will fester. That would be an immense waste. Most policymakers and well-off people would deny that it is a deep threat, though. The country‚Äôs religions, its distinctive mix of hierarchical culture and populist politics and its durable family structures will ensure social stability, they say.

They are probably right. They might want to pay their security guards a little more, though. Just in case.",https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577373-india-will-soon-have-fifth-worlds-working-age-population-it-urgently-needs-provide,

There is lots to celebrate about this. Mr Singh‚Äôs business has sales of $185m and its employee base has grown by 1,600% since 2000. He is looking for a Western partner and wants to expand to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. He is providing paid work for part of the large cohort of young people now entering the workforce. And by shifting people from farms to cities he is helping urbanisation of the sort that underpinned startling progress elsewhere in Asia.

Yet Frontline is also a symptom of a colossal failure. For it is not supplying labour for a manufacturing boom of the kind that helped so many in China, South Korea and Taiwan out of poverty, or for the IT services at which India has excelled. Instead it offers relatively unproductive service-sector jobs‚Äîin particular, security guards. It has become de rigueur for every ATM, office, shop and apartment building to have guards. Across India millions of young men now sit all day on plastic seats in badly fitting uniforms with braids and epaulettes, unshaven and catatonically bored as the economic miracle passes by. This isn‚Äôt how East Asia got rich.

From a bomb to a boom and back

During the boom of the 1990s and 2000s, it became fashionable to talk of India‚Äôs forthcoming ‚Äúdemographic dividend‚Äù. This was quite a turnaround. In the 1960s and 1970s, the booming populations of states like Bihar were seen as a curse. ‚ÄúThe Population Bomb‚Äù, a Malthusian bestseller by two American environmentalists, Paul and Anne Ehrlich, began by describing ‚Äúone stinking hot night in Delhi‚Äù, and its horrifying number of ‚Äúpeople, people, people, people‚Äù. In the 1970s there was a forced sterilisation programme. Sanjay Gandhi, a thuggish scion of the ruling dynasty, organised vasectomy camps near Delhi‚Äîone doctor boasted he could perform 40 sterilisations an hour.

In the 1990s, though, economic liberalisers evoked the experiences of East Asia and the demographic dividend it benefited from when previously high fertility rates began to decline. Working-age populations rose at the same time as the ratio of dependants to workers fell. An associated rise in the rate of saving allowed more investment, helping pay for the vast expansion in manufacturing that employed those workers and lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. In the mid2000s the prospect of a similar dividend in India, where the fertility rate had dropped a lot in the 1980s and 1990s, was a key reason for investors‚Äô optimism. The timing was particularly encouraging: India‚Äôs labour force was due to soar as China‚Äôs began to decline (see chart 1).

Now many are worried that India is squandering this demographic opportunity. This is partly because the economy is in a funk. Growth is at 4.5%, half the rate at the peak in the mid-2000s. Industry is 27% of output, compared with 40-47% in other big developing Asian economies. High inflation has prompted households to store ever more of their savings in physical assets rather than the financial system (see chart 2). The costs are clear. With few manufacturing exports, India has a chronic balance-of-payments problem. And India has created too few formal jobs in the past decade.

India‚Äôs leaders have long said they are committed to employment, but have shown little stomach for the economic upheaval rapid job creation entails. China‚Äôs policymakers accepted that the process of adding jobs overall often destroyed jobs in particular industries and places. For years India‚Äôs politicians have preferred economic palliatives such as NREGA, a giant scheme that guarantees work for the rural poor, and subsidies for the needy.

Now India‚Äôs borrowing has soared to queasy levels and welfare spending is being squeezed. There are worries that joblessness could be feeding the spasmodic unrest seen in some cities since 2011. Not all protesters were young. And their motivation varied from support for the anti-corruption guru Anna Hazare to disgust at a series of rapes in Delhi. But the protests added to a sense of youthful volatility.

An official report into the public finances in 2012 warned that a combination of slower growth and the demographic bulge could be ‚Äúpolitically destabilising‚Äù. Rahul Gandhi, who is poised to lead the ruling Congress party in the general election due by 2014, speaks of the ‚Äúangry‚Äù young and their ‚Äúurgent demand for jobs‚Äù. The government‚Äôs economic adviser, Raghuram Rajan, says jobs are the biggest priority. Some in the elite seem to be waking up. But is it too late?

Quantity and quality

To see the scale of the challenge, consider that the working-age population, aged between 15 and 64, will rise by 125m over the coming decade, and by a further 103m over the following decade. On current trends a third of the growth will come from poorer and less literate states in the north, notably Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Not everyone of working age will be in the job market. More people aged 15-24 will remain in education‚Äî26% do today. Some adult women will stay at home; presently only about a third work, a low level by Asian standards. But India probably needs to create about 100m net new jobs in the next decade.

China‚Äôs boom created 130m net jobs in services and industry between 2002 and 2012. But India is no China. The most recent survey showed no net new jobs were created between 2004-05 and 2009-10, a dramatic slowdown on the previous five years, when 60m jobs were created.

These figures may not be as shocking as they seem. Fewer jobs were created partly because some folk voluntarily withdrew from the workforce. More women in rural areas decided not to look for jobs‚Äîperhaps because several fairly good years for farmers meant they did not need the cash. Wages for the unskilled have been rising, and though this is partly because of the NREGA guaranteed-work scheme, it suggests there has not been a collapse in the jobs market. For all these caveats, though, the headline data remain disquieting. Even during a boom few jobs were created. Now that the economy is growing more slowly things have got harder.

The rural poor seem likely to be frustrated, which will add to the number of migrants headed for the cities. The better-educated will suffer, too. By some estimates India produces twice as many new graduates each year as it can absorb. In a half-built private-run campus in Patna most students have modest expectations of their future salaries‚Äîtypically $500 a month. Even so, their professor worries they won‚Äôt all get job offers.

The problem lies not just in the quantity of jobs, though; quality matters too. Statistics verify what the naked eye can see in any Indian city. They all have their armies of guards, peons, delivery boys, ear-dewaxers and men who sit on stools in lifts pressing the buttons. About 85% of India‚Äôs jobs are with ‚Äúinformal‚Äù enterprises‚Äîthose organisations with fewer than ten staff which are not incorporated. Another 11% are casual jobs with formal companies. Only 16% of Indians say they get a regular wage. People with informal jobs are usually very poor. An official study of 2004-05 data concludes that 80% of informal workers got less than the then national minimum wage of $1.46 a day. There are some good jobs. But India‚Äôs IT firms, for example, account for only a few million jobs out of a total of half a billion.

All this seems to be closely linked to the lack of manufacturing. Although some 23% of Indian workers are categorised as working in ‚Äúindustry‚Äù, compared to nearly 30% in China and 22% in Indonesia, half of India‚Äôs ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù workers are in construction whereas the figure is just a quarter in Indonesia. Of the remainder almost all are in the ‚Äúmanufacturing‚Äù subcategory. But these are not jobs that involve exposure to modern machinery, techniques and training (crucial for unskilled labour let down by the country‚Äôs education system). More than half of Indians in the manufacturing sector work in facilities without electricity.

The obvious problem is a ‚Äúmissing middle‚Äù. Most of the jobs are in tiny operations. Most of the value added is in a few big, sophisticated firms that prefer using machines to humans. Some, such as Tata Sons and Mahindra, are well-known. Most of those seem keener on expanding globally than on building factories at home. For every dollar of foreign direct investment (FDI) made by outsiders in Indian manufacturing in the five years to March 2012, local firms invested 65 cents in manufacturing abroad. The number of jobs in factories (excluding the very smallest) has increased since 2005; but only by 2.8m.

What manufacturing FDI India does attract tends to be high-end‚ÄîVolkswagen has a smart ‚Ç¨570m plant full of robots. Meanwhile investment is pouring into Vietnam and Indonesia (see chart 3) as costs in China rise. Li & Fung, a big trading firm based in Hong Kong which buys goods in Asia and sells them in the West to retailers including Walmart, gets some 5% of its goods from India, compared with about 20% from South-East Asia.

Death on the shop floor

India‚Äôs missed opportunity is most evident in textiles and clothing, a labour-intensive industry that has been dominated by China. In 2011 McKinsey, a consultancy, found that purchasing managers at global clothing firms wanted to shift their sourcing from China; their favoured new destinations included Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia and Cambodia‚Äîbut not India. India‚Äôs textile exports have grown, but those from Vietnam and Bangladesh, combined, easily outstrip them.

Why don‚Äôt more people want to make things in India? Indian migrant workers are sought across the world, not least in the Gulf. But at home tricky labour relations are a problem.

In a dusty lawyers‚Äô room in the industrial belt near Delhi, five workers explain how they were fired by Maruti Suzuki, a carmaker controlled by Suzuki of Japan, after simmering tensions on the shop floor led to a riot at a nearby plant in July 2012. A manager was burned to death. The men are in their 20s and from rural families. They have a strong sense of injustice. ‚ÄúWe have told our families that they should consider us as behind bars and that they should make other plans for their lives. We are ready for a long fight.‚Äù The Maruti violence has so far been a one-off. But the episode unnerved businesspeople.

Economists have long identified arcane labour laws as the key to India‚Äôs manufacturing problem. Scholars have gleefully dissected India‚Äôs 51 central and 170 state labour statutes, some of which pre-date independence, to demonstrate how they make it hard for firms with more than a handful of staff to fire people and allow disputes to become legal endurance tests. Studies have shown how tighter rules impede growth in labour-intensive industries and prompt firms to remain small.

Two-tier world

Yet the industrial belt in which Maruti‚Äôs factory sits shows times have changed. Big firms can bypass labour law by using ‚Äúcontract‚Äù workers, technically employed by third-party agents. In the past decade they have used‚Äîor, workers say, abused‚Äîthis kink in the rules a lot more. At three car and motorbike plants, based on discussions with workers, about 70% of 14,500 staff work on a contract basis. Their average wage is $5-6 per working day, a quarter of what permanent, unionised staff get. The minimum wage in Guangzhou, a Chinese industrial hub, is $10.5 per working day.

That might appear to be good news. If lots of factory workers can be hired at globally competitive rates, on flexible terms, manufacturing firms should pile into India. In practice the situation is unstable. As the Maruti riot showed, the two-tier workforce has caused anger‚Äîthe five men in the lawyers‚Äô room were permanent employees who say they were disgusted by the treatment of their contract colleagues. Maruti is abandoning the distinction. And from a financial perspective the contract system is not as good as it looks for employers. They must still hire unionised permanent staff, and though these may be in a minority they can account for the majority of a plant‚Äôs wage bill, lifting the average pay across all workers to Chinese levels.

The labour situation is a long way from the strikes and militancy of the 1970s, but it is unpredictable. That puts off potential manufacturers. And there are lots of other deterrents, too, from red tape to erratic electricity (see, for example, the monumental blackout across north and east India in 2012), a lack of land, bad roads and busy ports. One shipping boss thinks logistics add 20% to the cost of making something in India, compared with 6-8% in China. The Middle Kingdom hardly excelled on such metrics 20 years ago, but India does seem to be especially intimidating for industrial firms. Where non-labour problems have been tackled, notably in Gujarat, manufacturing does better. But Gujarat‚Äîpopulation 60m‚Äîis not a big state by Indian standards.

Since 2000 India has tried carving out special economic zones (SEZs) to create islands with lower taxes and access to infrastructure, where manufacturers can feel at home. But these have been a limited success, with many dominated by IT firms. A new twist is a proposed industrial corridor between Delhi and Mumbai, inspired by the expressway between Seoul and Busan in South Korea. The project has Japanese support, but basic things such as access to land and water have yet to be settled.

In its frustration India is flirting with a more overt industrial policy. A new rule says that government offices must now buy computers with a chunk of components made locally. This is designed to improve the balance of payments and promote an indigenous industry. The government is also now offering subsidies that could be worth billions of dollars to attract a microchip foundry. There is a push to indigenise the defence industry.

The legislation on offer to try to change the situation more generally may not enthuse industry. There are noises about labour-law reform, but rather than liberalise the regime for permanent workers it may merely tighten the one for contract employees. A bill that is supposed to make it easier to buy land could make the process even more expensive and protracted, argue many businesspeople.

For robust jobs growth there must be a change of mindset among officials, judges and politicians. Although Mr Gandhi and others are talking about the challenge, not everyone is, partly due to the electoral system‚Äôs skew towards the countryside. Only 10% of legislators in the lower house have urban constituencies in which 75% or more of the population is urban, reckons the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a think-tank. Jobs in factories in cities are not a priority for most politicians.

Failing gently

Could the voices of the young change this? There is a rising level of political involvement. A recent survey by CSDS and the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung, a German think-tank, found that nearly twice as many of today‚Äôs 18- to 33-year-olds say they are interested in politics as did in 1996. Some 20% of young rural men say they participate in protests, as do 22% of college-educated young men. Those with exposure to the media, from talk shows to social media, are most politically active. One of India‚Äôs big mobile-messaging sites, Nimbuzz, with 25m mostly young users, says traffic doubled in the aftermath of the rape scandal in Delhi in December and during the Anna Hazare anti-graft protests. But the young have little independent political identity; their party allegiance is much like that of their parents. Nor do they have any obvious muscle.

The lack of political resolve and of a clear signal from voters mean India is unlikely to summon up the single-minded dedication with which South Korea, Taiwan and China created industrial jobs. Its demographic dividend will yield only a fraction of what it could, and the problem of low-quality employment will fester. That would be an immense waste. Most policymakers and well-off people would deny that it is a deep threat, though. The country‚Äôs religions, its distinctive mix of hierarchical culture and populist politics and its durable family structures will ensure social stability, they say.

They are probably right. They might want to pay their security guards a little more, though. Just in case.",https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21577373-india-will-soon-have-fifth-worlds-working-age-population-it-urgently-needs-provide,
Welfare in India - A better anti-poverty plan for India,"G OOD KING WENCESLAS thought of the poor when the weather turned cold. Election season has the same effect on India‚Äôs politicians. With national polls looming in April and May, the two main political parties are competing to shower money on the indigent. The governing Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has already started paying benefits to farmers who own less than two hectares (five acres) of land. The Congress party promises cash payments for the poorest 50m households. The new focus on the problem is admirable, but these ideas need rethinking.

India has about 50m people living in extreme poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock, an Austrian research project. Many others are severely pinched. Yet India‚Äôs safety-net is both immensely complicated, with over 950 centrally funded schemes and subsidies, and stingy. Old people protested in the capital last year, complaining that the central-government pension of 200 rupees ($3) a month has been frozen since 2007. Much of the money spent on welfare never gets to the poor. Numerous subsidies for fertiliser, power, water and so forth are snaffled by better-off farmers or go into officials‚Äô pockets. A large rural employment scheme does mostly reach poor people, since nobody else is prepared to dig ditches all day under the hot sun. But it is expensive to run and prevents participants from doing any other work. A study carried out in Bihar, a poor state, by the World Bank estimated that you could cut poverty at least as much by taking the money for the scheme and dividing it among the entire population, whether poor or not.

It is welcome, then, that the parties are vying to come up with better schemes. And it is especially encouraging that both the BJP and Congress are proposing simply to give people money. Distributing cash is cheaper than handing out jobs or food, and allows poor people to buy whatever they need. As bank accounts spread and India‚Äôs biometric ID system matures, it should be possible to curb fraud and theft.

Yet the politicians‚Äô plans are ill thought out. Even if the BJP ‚Äôs bung to farmers manages to get round the problem that many lack clear land titles, it will do nothing for landless labourers, who are often poorer than smallholders. It would have perverse consequences, too, for it would discourage small farmers from getting bigger. Congress‚Äôs scheme to pay needy families 6,000 rupees a month is better (see article), but faces the practical and political difficulties involved in targeting the poor.

Targeting welfare is costly and difficult in a country like India. How is the state supposed to identify the poorest 50m households in a country where income and spending are so hard to track? If it looks for signs such as straw roofs, it will almost certainly miss many poor people, especially in the cities. The political economy of targeted schemes is also tricky. In countries with minimal welfare states, schemes with few beneficiaries also have few supporters, and therefore risk being quietly wound down or diminished by inflation. And any formula used to target the bottom 20% is likely to be so opaque that people will never know whether they should have been included or not, so cannot fight for their entitlements. A workfare scheme in Argentina, trabajar, was so well-targeted‚Äî75% of its beneficiaries were among the bottom 30%‚Äîthat it lost political support and was replaced by a benefit with broader appeal. As Amartya Sen, an Indian economist, put it, benefits that go only to the poor often end up being poor benefits.

Two years ago a government report suggested a bold new approach. Instead of a universal basic income‚Äîan idea doing the rounds in rich countries‚Äîcreate a nearly universal scheme from which you exclude the richest quarter of the population. They are easier (and therefore cheaper) to spot than the poorest. The report estimated that poverty could be virtually eradicated at a cost of 5% of GDP ‚Äîjust about the same as the combined cost of the existing schemes and subsidies. Transfers to the very poor would be lower under Congress‚Äôs plan, but since a broader scheme‚Äôs chances of survival are higher, indigent Indians would probably benefit more in the long run.

Binning the hotch-potch of existing schemes and implementing a radical new system would be politically difficult. Yet the broader plan may have a better chance than a targeted scheme, since many of the beneficiaries of the old schemes would get some cash under the new one. And it must be worth a try. The eradication of one of the world‚Äôs very worst problems is a prize worth fighting for.",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/06/a-better-anti-poverty-plan-for-india,
Economy - A downturn in India reveals the desperate need for deeper reform,"W ITHIN A FEW years, Indian planners hope that bullet trains will reduce the time taken for the 500km (310 miles) journey between Mumbai, the commercial capital, and Ahmedabad, the biggest city in Mr Modi‚Äôs home state of Gujarat, from six hours to just two. For now, laws that protect tiny properties are holding up the railway‚Äôs construction. Two years after breaking ground, the Japanese-financed project has not yet managed to acquire even half the land it needs. By contrast, China added another 4,000km of track for its nationwide high-speed network in 2018 alone.

Historians reckon that the two Asian giants have had roughly equal economies for much of their history. Only since the 1990s, when China began its daring, deep-seated economic reforms, has it raced ahead. Its nominal GDP is now five times India‚Äôs. The dragon has slowed its pace, but even so, notes a report by Rakesh Mohan, a Yale professor and former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), the country‚Äôs central bank, it is still adding the equivalent of a quarter of India‚Äôs economy every year. If India were to sustain its GDP growth per person of 7%‚Äîabout its average for the past two decades‚Äîto 2030, it would barely have got to where China is today. And even that may prove ambitious.

Now, with alarming speed, India has gone from being the world‚Äôs fastest-growing large economy to something more like a rumbling Indian railway train. In the quarter to June, growth slipped to 5%, the slowest in six years. Other indicators are more worrying still. Sales of trucks and buses fell 45% in the year to September, and even sales of cheap biscuits and soap have contracted. The 88% drop in overall credit flows to businesses in the two quarters to September compared with the same period last year suggests a virtual freeze on lending.

Believing its own boosterism, the government failed to see the signs. Yet even as the slowdown became more pronounced, Mr Modi still managed to get himself re-elected in May with a huge majority. The first budget of his second term, announced in July by the incoming finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, signalled business as usual. The emphasis was on new taxes, more handouts, more regulations, a further bail-out of public-sector banks and the airy goal of doubling India‚Äôs GDP to $5trn within five years. As the summer wore on, however, it became clearer that the economy had turned against Mr Modi, even if the electorate had not. The big question now is whether the downturn will be bad enough to force the prime minister into some of the much-needed reforms that he avoided in his first term. Some changes have started to be made in the past few months.

Initial tweaks in August had little effect, but on September 20th the government abruptly decreed a sharp cut in corporate tax, from an effective rate of 35% to a far more competitive 25%. The move prompted Mumbai‚Äôs biggest stockmarket leap in a decade. The market‚Äôs instant, oversized joy suggests two things. One is that there is a great deal of pent-up energy in the Indian economy, waiting to be released by wiser government policies. The other is that if Mr Modi‚Äôs government puts in some effort, it is capable of coming up with those wiser policies. Businesses are watching to see what will follow. There are rumours of a sweeping privatisation drive. But it is unclear whether Mr Modi‚Äôs reforming side can override his conservatism, which reflexively favours an interventionist state, protectionist trade policies and the opinions of Hindutva trade unions, small business lobbies and ideologues.

Some progress

These tensions played out during Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, which saw the introduction of some welcome reforms. A long-overdue bankruptcy law theoretically reduced the time to settle a business failure from around four years to nine months. The GST did, for all its paperwork, abolish absurd interstate duties and so sped up internal commerce. Fiscal discipline kept inflation modest. Infrastructure‚Äîand in particular power supplies‚Äîimproved substantially. Over the past decade 30m more Indians every year have been connected to the electric grid, which now reaches 90% of all homes. India climbed a stunning 65 places up the World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business Index and pulled in record hauls of foreign investment, totalling more than $35bn in each of the past three years.

Yet the government shied away repeatedly from risking its political capital on deeper structural reforms. Labour laws that make hiring and firing too expensive remained a block to growth, as did laws making it hard for companies to acquire land. Such blockages continue to hamstring efforts to expand India‚Äôs manufacturing base, Chinese-style, to create plentiful low-paid factory jobs for rural migrants. Instead of supporting small business, the government experimented with shock demonetisation, fancy new taxes and heavier enforcement. Rather than promoting trade, it scrapped existing bilateral deals, raised tariffs and sparred with the WTO . Disappointing his own business constituency, Mr Modi dodged calls to privatise some banks, industries and utilities, instead forcing healthy state-owned firms to swallow sick ones.

At the same time, regulators moved too slowly to deal with an urgent problem. Driven by starry forecasts and cronyism under the previous government, state-owned banks had let non-performing loans inflate to a $200bn balloon. Then, caught in the glare of increased scrutiny, they reined in lending, further crimping investment and pushing credit-seekers towards non-banking financial corporations ( NBFC s). In October 2018 a default by one of those caused hiccups across the financial sector. Despite $30bn in government bail-outs for state banks, and a slow decline in non-performing assets, lenders and borrowers remain wary. Though foreign direct investment stayed strong in Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, all but a trickle of the new money poured into services and a few big acquisitions, rather than job- or export-generating industry. The largest single deal saw Walmart, an American retail giant, splash out $16bn for control of Flipkart, an online retailer. The ink had scarcely dried on Walmart‚Äôs cheque before the government radically changed the e-commerce rules that had underpinned Walmart‚Äôs decision to invest. Small traders, who are an important part of the influential Hindutva business lobby, had pressed the government for changes, revealing the kind of obstacles that reforms have to overcome. All the while, talk of Indian growth obscured such facts as declining farmgate prices, stagnant urban wages, flat exports, rising household debt, a long-term decline in savings and investment rates, and flat or falling consumer spending. Some of India‚Äôs top economists did notice the gloomy numbers and realised that since the country‚Äôs statistics agency changed its methodology in 2011, there had been growing divergences between calculations of GDP and a range of other indicators. The doubters, who include Arvind Subramanian, the government‚Äôs chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018, do not suggest foul play but rather poor methodology, compounded by the difficulty of measuring an ‚Äúinformal‚Äù sector that makes up 45% of the economy and accounts for 75% of employment. If the critics are right, growth since 2011 may have been overstated by 2-2.5% a year. As Mr Subramanian notes, the trouble with bungling the numbers is that it is like driving with a faulty speedometer. Indeed, the strongest proof that growth was overstated may be that India appears to have driven off course. The current slump can largely be ascribed to policies followed in the mistaken belief that India was hurtling along at 7-8% annual growth, when the reality was more like 5-6%.

Since the slowdown has taken hold, Ms Sitharaman has scrapped the most onerous of new taxes and compliance rules. She also announced the government would support NBFC s, and top up a range of schemes meant to ease access to export credits and housing loans. Amid a series of rate cuts by the RBI , the government also imposed a slew of mergers between state-owned banks that will, in theory, improve their books and make them keener to lend. The sudden move to slash company taxes came with a further sweetener, a two-year window for new industrial investments to attract a rate of just 17%.

Businesses have broadly welcomed all these moves, as well as having their tax cut by a third, but concerns persist. Though the supply-side tinkering helps, it does not indicate personal attention from Mr Modi, let alone the kind of policy shift many feel is needed to kick-start growth. ‚ÄúThe lack of economic vision baffles me,‚Äù says a conservative think-tank scholar who now regrets voting for Mr Modi. ‚ÄúThey get this monster electoral verdict, and then do nothing?‚Äù

Turning ten stodgy state banks into four bigger ones, for instance, may indeed strengthen the financial sector in the long term. More immediately, though, it ties up the institutions just when the economy needs them. The government promises to buy itself more cars, and to lower interest rates on housing for public servants, but neglects stronger demand-side prods such as rural public works. Ms Sitharaman talks of tweaking export credits and speeding tax reimbursements for exporters, when letting the overvalued rupee drop would boost exports even more. She has chastised tax officers for being overly aggressive, but aside from the cut in corporate rates that simply brings India closer to world averages, has proposed no other bold tax relief. This is badly needed. India has some of the world‚Äôs most convoluted taxes, and enforces them with gusto. GST paperwork is tricky. Rates for some goods are ruinously high. Cement and cars are taxed at 28% (plus hefty further taxes for cars), which is odd if you wish to save manufacturing jobs or spur housing investment. Some personal stories are hair-raising. One luxury-goods executive complains that inspectors invaded his home at gunpoint in the middle of the night and held him and his wife hostage for two days, threatening jail for not co-operating as they poked through his cupboards. They found nothing, but left the businessman shaken. He has decided to leave the country.

Can‚Äôt rely on unicorns

Despite the gouging, the government is faced with a chronic deficit. It pretends this is a mere 3.4%, but after allowing for hidden off-budget liabilities and state debts, overall government borrowing is closer to 9%. August brought a reprieve, with a hefty and controversial dividend payment from the central bank to shore up revenue. But those off-budget fudges, demands from states and shrinking tax receipts will soon start to squeeze the exchequer.

The gloom is not universal. The $180bn IT sector, centred on boomtowns like Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) and Hyderabad, continues to prosper. NASSCOM , an industry body, counted 7,200 start-ups in 2018, of which eight became ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù, valued at over $1bn. Tata Consulting Services passed another milestone for Indian IT firms, reaching a market capital of $100bn. The sector cannot pull the rest of India along, however, and has its own limits. NASSCOM predicts that automation is likely to shrink the number of IT jobs‚Äîcurrently more than 4m‚Äîby some 14% in the next five years.

Population growth, rising productivity and growing aspirations can probably propel a big, diversified economy at a steady 5%. Barring a global crisis, even without ambitious new policies, India may be able to climb out of the current doldrums. Returning to the trajectory of 7-8% growth would take a little longer.

With luck, in a few years‚Äô time, the present slump may be regarded as a useful catalysing moment, like the economic crisis of 1991 that sparked India‚Äôs initial market reforms. But bringing back the brash, risk-taking ebullience of the mid-2000s will not be easy. Many believed Mr Modi when he promised achhe din‚Äîgood times‚Äîin 2014. Starting his second term with a deep slump, he has no one to blame but himself. Worse, say critics, he has no one to turn to. Ms Sitharaman is tough and straight, but her team does not inspire confidence. ‚ÄúWe always had bad institutions, but a few really talented people‚Äîninjas who could go in and make things work,‚Äù says a former finance-ministry mandarin. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs a Trumpian wasteland.‚Äù‚ñ†",https://www.economist.com/special-report/2019/10/24/a-downturn-in-india-reveals-the-desperate-need-for-deeper-reform,

India has about 50m people living in extreme poverty, according to the World Poverty Clock, an Austrian research project. Many others are severely pinched. Yet India‚Äôs safety-net is both immensely complicated, with over 950 centrally funded schemes and subsidies, and stingy. Old people protested in the capital last year, complaining that the central-government pension of 200 rupees ($3) a month has been frozen since 2007. Much of the money spent on welfare never gets to the poor. Numerous subsidies for fertiliser, power, water and so forth are snaffled by better-off farmers or go into officials‚Äô pockets. A large rural employment scheme does mostly reach poor people, since nobody else is prepared to dig ditches all day under the hot sun. But it is expensive to run and prevents participants from doing any other work. A study carried out in Bihar, a poor state, by the World Bank estimated that you could cut poverty at least as much by taking the money for the scheme and dividing it among the entire population, whether poor or not.

It is welcome, then, that the parties are vying to come up with better schemes. And it is especially encouraging that both the BJP and Congress are proposing simply to give people money. Distributing cash is cheaper than handing out jobs or food, and allows poor people to buy whatever they need. As bank accounts spread and India‚Äôs biometric ID system matures, it should be possible to curb fraud and theft.

Yet the politicians‚Äô plans are ill thought out. Even if the BJP ‚Äôs bung to farmers manages to get round the problem that many lack clear land titles, it will do nothing for landless labourers, who are often poorer than smallholders. It would have perverse consequences, too, for it would discourage small farmers from getting bigger. Congress‚Äôs scheme to pay needy families 6,000 rupees a month is better (see article), but faces the practical and political difficulties involved in targeting the poor.

Targeting welfare is costly and difficult in a country like India. How is the state supposed to identify the poorest 50m households in a country where income and spending are so hard to track? If it looks for signs such as straw roofs, it will almost certainly miss many poor people, especially in the cities. The political economy of targeted schemes is also tricky. In countries with minimal welfare states, schemes with few beneficiaries also have few supporters, and therefore risk being quietly wound down or diminished by inflation. And any formula used to target the bottom 20% is likely to be so opaque that people will never know whether they should have been included or not, so cannot fight for their entitlements. A workfare scheme in Argentina, trabajar, was so well-targeted‚Äî75% of its beneficiaries were among the bottom 30%‚Äîthat it lost political support and was replaced by a benefit with broader appeal. As Amartya Sen, an Indian economist, put it, benefits that go only to the poor often end up being poor benefits.

Two years ago a government report suggested a bold new approach. Instead of a universal basic income‚Äîan idea doing the rounds in rich countries‚Äîcreate a nearly universal scheme from which you exclude the richest quarter of the population. They are easier (and therefore cheaper) to spot than the poorest. The report estimated that poverty could be virtually eradicated at a cost of 5% of GDP ‚Äîjust about the same as the combined cost of the existing schemes and subsidies. Transfers to the very poor would be lower under Congress‚Äôs plan, but since a broader scheme‚Äôs chances of survival are higher, indigent Indians would probably benefit more in the long run.

Binning the hotch-potch of existing schemes and implementing a radical new system would be politically difficult. Yet the broader plan may have a better chance than a targeted scheme, since many of the beneficiaries of the old schemes would get some cash under the new one. And it must be worth a try. The eradication of one of the world‚Äôs very worst problems is a prize worth fighting for.",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/04/06/a-better-anti-poverty-plan-for-india,
India - Shovelling for their supper,"The world's biggest public-works project just got bigger. In some places it is working better than many feared; but by no means everywhere

James Astill

OUTSIDE Ajit Pura village, in India's arid state of Rajasthan, 42 women and a man scrape earth into panniers, hoist the panniers to their heads, and walk the contents up to a low embankment rising on the edge of the work-site. It is designed to slow the passage of monsoon flood-water, encouraging more of the precious liquid to infiltrate Ajit Pura's dusty soil. This should help irrigate just a few peasant plots for a year or two, before the embankment is washed away. And yet, modest as that sounds, to some development wonks this site is revolutionary.

Its creation was a policy cornerstone of the coalition government led by the Congress party: a guarantee of 100 days' employment on public works each year to any rural household that requests it. As an eye-catching promise‚Äîin a country where some 260m exist below the poverty line‚Äîit helped Congress win power in 2004. And with an eye to India's next general election, due by May 2009, the party's leaders are now making brave claims for its success. Last year, operating in 330 districts, the ‚ÄúNational Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme‚Äù (NREGS) provided 30m families with an average of 43 days' work. This month, to much fanfare, NREGS went India-wide (see map).

India has a history of rotten public-works schemes. At best, these have produced nothing of much value: Rajasthan, a drought-prone region, is littered with their residue: ditches and dykes as mysterious in function as crop circles. Worse, public-works budgets have made easy plunder for corrupt officials. By Congress's own rule of thumb‚Äîattributed to Rajiv Gandhi, the party's murdered leader, in the 1980s and since parroted by activist and politician alike‚Äî85% of welfare spending fails to reach its intended recipients.

To devotees of the scheme, including several fiery campaigners who helped design it, NREGS is different: above all, because its provisions are enshrined in the law. Wherever it applies, Indians may demand employment as their right. If it is not provided within 15 days, they are entitled to receive unemployment benefit. What is more, many safeguards have been written into the scheme, in an effort to make it more transparent and less misused than its predecessors. To exorcise ghost workers, NREGS muster rolls are read aloud at work-sites each morning. Many of these lists are available online. To chase away dodgy contractors‚Äîa main beneficiary of some works projects‚Äîat least 60% of the funds devoted to NREGS must be spent on wages for manual labourers.

Another beauty of the scheme, for its supporters, is that these poor folk are self-selecting: only a genuinely needy man would be likely to labour under an Indian sun for 60 rupees ($1.50) a day, the national minimum wage stipulated under NREGS. In tandem with one or two other recent efforts to hold the underperforming Indian state to account‚Äîfor example, a right to information law, passed in 2005‚ÄîNREGS represents for some starry-eyed acolytes the basis for a social-security system in a country that has more poor people than any other.

In Rajasthan, at least, it is working well. With its history of public works, and with fairly well-established local governments to run the scheme, the state last year came closer to honouring its prescriptions than any other. In the fiscal year that ended this March, Rajasthan provided an average of 85 days' work to some 2m households, a threefold increase in public-works employment offered by the state.

Better still, in Rajasthan NREGS employees came mostly from India's poorest groups: including 19% from dalit (formerly ‚Äúuntouchable‚Äù) castes, and 46% from tribal groups. Nearly 70% were women. Earning 73 rupees for a day's labour‚Äîthe minimum wage set by the state‚Äîthey did better than their sisters working in agriculture. In 2005 the average agricultural wage for women in Rajasthan was 48 rupees a day.

In Ajit Pura, in Rajasthan's southern district of Jalor, these benefits are manifest. According to the muster roll displayed at its work-site, 19 of the 43 workers belong to marginalised groups. They include the only man, Rajesh Harijan, from the Hindu sweeper caste, who shares street-sweeping duties in the village with his brother, rotating annually. The brothers are paid for this with sporadic gifts of bread.

Victory for digging

Another shoveller, Hiri Bawari, presents an even starker vindication of the scheme. As a temporary crutch for agricultural labourers, NREGS was designed to tide them over the lean season between sowing and reaping, and thus stanch temporary migrations to India's cities. Thereby, it is hoped, NREGS should ensure that the education of rural children is not disrupted‚Äîand in the case of Ms Bawari's children, that is so. A resident of Ajit Pura, she used to migrate to Punjab and Haryana, making and hawking plaster statues of Hindu gods. Together, Ms Bawari, her husband and their ten-year-old son used to earn 50 rupees a day for this work. Now she earns 73 rupees. Her husband earns 100 rupees as a farm labourer (happily, local wage-rates have risen, allegedly because of competition from NREGS). And the couple's three sons are in school.

It is a hopeful tale, but not typical. In a state that has embraced NREGS, Jalor is an especially well-run district. Its top official, or district magistrate, has made several improvements to the scheme‚Äîdefying local mores, for example, by insisting that at least one-third of work-site foremen are women. Elsewhere, alas, NREGS frequently offers little obvious improvement on the rotten works schemes of the past.

Enthusiasm for NREGS among state governments has been patchy, with some of India's poorest and most populous states, such as Bihar and Jharkhand, slow to adopt it. Others have politicised NREGS, viewing it through the prism of their relations with the central government: Uttar Pradesh's 180m people, for example, saw no benefit from the scheme until mid-2007, when they elected a state government less hostile to the one in Delhi.

Even where the scheme is working well, it has hiccups. Jalor, for example, is supposed to have 27 locally hired engineers, to provide technical advice to the local governments. But, in a poor district, only five engineers can be found‚Äîof whom four have in fact been dragooned from other government service.

Elsewhere, a surfeit of pointless earth embankments is the least of the trouble. A report on NREGS by an autonomous government auditor, released in January, pinpointed many examples of error and abuse. Another, by researchers at Allahabad University, estimated that 33% of NREGS wages in Jharkhand were being trousered by corrupt officials (the government disputes this). Hardly any unemployment benefit has been paid to millions of people who are currently being denied all or part of their 100-day entitlement. India's rural development minister, Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, admits some of these ‚Äúshortcomings‚Äù, which arise, he says, ‚Äúbecause so many dishonest people are there‚Äù. But he is confident that, because of the transparency and checks in the scheme, the failings will be put right in a year or two.

That the states' bad behaviour makes NREGS so far neither national nor guaranteed does at least ease one big concern: its cost. This was originally projected at $11 billion a year. According to Mr Singh, however, though NREGS may overshoot its provisional budget of $4 billion this year, it is unlikely to cost more than $6 billion annually. Its opportunity cost may be another matter. According to a recent World Bank simulation, more Indian peasants would be withdrawn from poverty if the government just handed them cash‚Äîwithout first making them shovel dirt.",https://www.economist.com/asia/2008/04/24/shovelling-for-their-supper,
The muddle Modi made - Narendra Modi is damaging India‚Äôs economy as well as its democracy,"The country at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms. But he is not acting

S TORIES OF THE clampdown in Jammu & Kashmir and the threat to strip millions of poor and mostly Muslim people in Assam of citizenship, a form of ethnic cleansing by bureaucracy, have seeped into the world‚Äôs consciousness, but many Western businesspeople are still inclined to defend the Indian prime minister. Even if Narendra Modi is bad for democracy, they say, his pro-business philosophy is good for the economy. But, as our special report this week argues, that argument no longer washes. India‚Äôs economy is incompetently managed and doing badly.

Growth fell from 8% in the middle of last year to 5% year-on-year in the most recent quarter. That might not sound too bad, and other emerging economies are also suffering, but India needs to grow fast just to keep its vast workforce fully employed. Worse, the slowdown looks less like a dip than a prolonged cold shower.

Some banks and many other lenders are in crisis, with a $200bn mountain of bad debts. In the six months ending in September, the total flow of financing to businesses fell by 88%. Five successive rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, have failed to pull down commercial lending rates, and in any case firms are not investing. Consumer demand has levelled off or fallen, too. Sales of cars and motorbikes have tumbled by 20% or more. And with the combined fiscal deficit of the federal government and the states already approaching 9% of GDP , and tax receipts falling well below expectations, there is little scope for stimulus.

When it first took power in 2014 Mr Modi‚Äôs government inherited an economy with plenty of problems, but it did too little about them. The latest downturn continues that disappointing pattern. With the exception of a steep cut in corporate taxes earlier this month, to 25%, which brings India into line with other countries in the region, the official response has been scattershot and timid. This, say critics, reflects both an unusual paucity of expertise in Mr Modi‚Äôs government and conflicting views in his circle, as competing interest groups vie for his ear. Nevertheless, the outlines of what needs to be done are clear. To start with, Mr Modi should recruit an economic team that is based on competence and experience rather than affinity for the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs Hindu-nationalist ideology. It must tackle both the financial crisis and sagging demand. To fix the banking system, the banks and the lightly regulated shadow banks that have recently been lending heavily need to be stress-tested and, where necessary, the banks recapitalised. Eventually, the state-owned banks could be privatised and the shadow banks put under the same prudential regulations as other lenders. A broader privatisation programme would give the government the money it needs to succour demand. It should make use of levers such as the national rural-employment scheme to get money to the distressed hinterland. In the longer run, the tax system, labour laws, the regulation of land-ownership and fiddly, protectionist tariffs should all be given a thorough overhaul. Many of these items have been on the to-do list of every Indian government for decades. But the long history of stasis only strengthens the case for change. And in Mr Modi, with his vice-like grip on parliament, his reputation as a friend of business and his need to right a foundering economy, India at last has a leader with the power and the incentives to push through big reforms.

The fear is that, instead of getting to grips with the economy, Mr Modi will stop posing as a reformer and fully embrace his alter ego, as a chest-thumping Hindu nationalist. Just months into his second term, he has already abolished India‚Äôs only Muslim-majority state and is threatening to expand to the rest of the country his scheme to hunt down supposed foreign interlopers in Assam. In the face of India‚Äôs growing economic problems, Mr Modi‚Äôs focus on communal grievances seems even more reprehensible. Alas, he may yet draw the opposite conclusion. ‚ñ†",https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/10/24/narendra-modi-is-damaging-indias-economy-as-well-as-its-democracy,
Reform and its discontents - India's non-crippling labour strike,"TEN of India‚Äôs 12 trade-union federations joined a nationwide strike yesterday to protest at proposals to reform India‚Äôs employment laws. The strike was billed as the biggest show of strength by unions for years, perhaps ever, with industries from coal mining, banking and transport affected. The unions claimed 150m workers downed tools or pens. Labour bosses ramped up the rhetoric. Tapan Sen, general-secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions spoke of the workers‚Äô anger at ‚Äúthe attempts to deny their basic rights by amending the labour laws to benefit the national and multinational corporations‚Äù. He claimed several industries were brought to a standstill.

Yet a day later the general impression is that the strike was anything but crippling. The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a business lobby group, said the impact of the strike was ‚Äúpartial‚Äù. Coal output was much reduced, by not stopped altogether. In banking, reports suggest employees of State Bank of India, the largest of the state-owned lenders that dominate the sector, as well as of the larger private-sector banks all turned up for work. Striking auto-rickshaw drivers made it hard for others to get to work in Delhi. But other big cities appeared less affected. So far as the strike seemed to worry the CII, the concern was for the image of India it sent to potential foreign investors.

The response from the government was something close to a shrug. ‚ÄúThe situation remained, by and large, peaceful accross the country,‚Äù said a release from the labour ministry. ‚ÄúMost of the employees attended their offices.‚Äù The labour minister was soon on an airplane bound for a G20 labour summit in Turkey.

The strike was a passionless affair in part because what provoked it were fairly modest proposals for labour reform. The government wants to streamline India‚Äôs 44 labour laws into five codes covering wages, conditions, social security, industrial relations and training. It also proposes to raise the employment threshold at which employers must ask for permission from government to lay off workers‚Äîfrom 100 employees to 300‚Äîa reform that has already been adopted in the state of Rajasthan. In return it has offered unions a national minimum wage and a broader social-security net. Since only a small proportion of India workers are protected by any such legislation, there ought to be a new labour deal that would work for all. Sadly, many union bosses think otherwise.",https://www.economist.com/asia/2015/09/03/indias-non-crippling-labour-strike,
A poor innings - India‚Äôs budget disappoints investors,"ONLY A CRICKET match with Pakistan could have drawn as much attention. At 11am on February 1st every financier, investor and trader stopped what they were doing in order to watch Nirmala Sitharaman, the finance minister, unveil the budget. The stockmarket opened for a special Saturday trading session. Employees in banks‚Äô trading and asset-management divisions, usually closed for the weekend, went into work.

The stakes were especially high this year. The economy has floundered‚Äîthe government expects GDP growth of 5% in the year to March 31st, the weakest since the financial crisis. An interim budget in the summer, after Narendra Modi‚Äôs re-election as prime minister, had flopped. The government then tried to revive animal spirits by sharply cutting corporate-tax rates. A wide fiscal deficit appeared to allow little room for a big spending increase. The stockmarket had been sagging in the weeks leading up to the budget, not helped by weaker markets worldwide.

In the event, the budget disappointed. By the time Ms Sitharaman sat down after speaking for a record two hours and 40 minutes, too exhausted to finish her prepared remarks, markets had plunged by 3%. ‚ÄúA bloodbath‚Äù, was the blunt verdict of the Economic Times.

Ms Sitharaman announced a number of measures, many of which appeared intended to simplify the tax system. Income-taxpayers can choose to shift from a complex system of higher rates and deductions to a lower rate without deductions. Those challenging past bills will be allowed to settle for the original amount, with no interest or penalty charges. Taxpayers will be protected from harassment by officials‚Äîoften a cover for extortion. Levies on companies distributing dividends and on sovereign-wealth funds investing in infrastructure will be removed. Public spending on infrastructure and agriculture will rise.

The government expects to fund these measures by selling some of its stakes in state-owned companies. In an attempt to protect Indian industry, import duties on consumer goods, such as footwear and furniture, will go up, while those on manufacturers‚Äô inputs will fall.

Such measures are unlikely to revive the economy much. Moreover, many are unimpressive on closer examination. The infrastructure plans will rely on uncertain public-private partnerships. Past attempts at divestment have fallen flat. Some of the tax measures add complexity rather than simplify. The airwaves were dominated by chartered accountants pondering the many possible consequences of the income-tax reforms (which will no doubt require seeking their professional advice). The abolition of the dividend-distribution tax will be welcomed by foreign investors. But those at home expect it to be offset by new taxes and add to already high rates.

There was a big omission too. Many of the country‚Äôs publicly controlled banks, co-operative lenders and non-bank financial companies are in deep trouble. But the budget dashed hopes of a resolution. Ms Sitharaman announced an increase in deposit insurance, to soothe depositors‚Äô fears of losing their savings. She said she would urge the central bank to allow small firms more time to restructure their loans, which suggests that both borrowers and lenders are in a bad way.

The sheer number of provisions in the budget means businesses and investment firms will only gradually work out their consequences, both intended and unintended. More market reaction seems likely when play resumes on Monday.",https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2020/02/01/indias-budget-disappoints-investors,
Ranking the Indian states - The relative unease of doing business in India,"MAHATMA GANDHI believed it was difficult to conduct business in a strictly honest way. In India it has become hard to conduct business any way at all. It sits a lowly 142nd out of 189 countries in the World Bank‚Äôs ease-of-doing-business rankings. The country‚Äôs present-day boosters say a huge market of 1.25 billion people, half of them under 27, will continue to draw big companies to invest there, whatever the difficulties. Yet though India is a big market, it is not a uniform one. Each of its 29 states has its own rules on land purchase, employment, tax and the environment. And some states are friendlier to enterprise than are others.

Assessing the states India‚Äôs biggest states have more people living and earning in them than do most countries. For instance, Uttar Pradesh has a population of 200m, as many as in all of Brazil. But the World Bank rankings give no guide as to where it is easiest to set up shop in India. Its ranking for India is based only on business regulation in Delhi and Mumbai, the two largest cities. To plug this gap in knowledge, India‚Äôs commerce department has just published it first-ever ranking of India‚Äôs 29 states according to the ease of doing business in each place. (The report also covers three enclaves run by the central government from Delhi.) The scores are based on progress made in reforming business regulations in eight separate areas, including tax and employment. Gujarat, a state of 60m renowned for its business-friendliness, tops the list. Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state, is ranked tenth. Bihar, a largely rural state with 104m people that goes to the polls in October, is ranked a dismal 21st. Maharashtra, the state that encompasses Mumbai, is ranked a respectable eighth.

The idea behind the report is that naming and shaming low-ranking states will push them to make changes, that they may be awarded higher scores in future years. The best states might use their high ranking to pitch for more foreign-direct investment. State-led deregulation may even prove to be the best way to improve India‚Äôs overall lure to business. The government of Narendra Modi, who won an election last year on a pledge to revive the economy, has been thwarted by the most recent session of parliament in its efforts to change the national land-purchase law and to harmonise taxes across India. It has since indicated that it will allow state-level reforms to supersede national law, as a way around the gridlock. It has already blessed a labour reform by this back-door route in Rajasthan, a northern state. More states might now follow Rajasthan‚Äôs lead.",https://www.economist.com/asia/2015/09/17/the-relative-unease-of-doing-business-in-india,
Chugging along - India‚Äôs economy is back on track. Can it pick up speed?,"IT IS easy to be awed by the Indian railway network. The 23m passengers it carries daily travel, in total, over ten times the distance to the sun and back. It is just as easy to find it unimpressive. Delays are frequent and trains antiquated. It takes 14 hours to get from India‚Äôs capital, Delhi, to its commercial hub, Mumbai. The equivalent trip in China‚Äîfrom Beijing to Shanghai, a similar distance‚Äîtakes just over four hours.

Similarly, India‚Äôs economy can be seen in two lights. Its long-term growth rate of 7% a year has proved far more dependable than the rail timetable. GDP has doubled twice in the past two decades. Yet deep poverty still lingers and jobs are scarce. And Indian growth has been left in the dust by the Chinese express (see chart).

After slow running for much of 2017, India is now near to full throttle. Growth of 7.2% in the three months to December put it ahead of China (which grew at a relatively leisurely 6.8%) and made it once again the world‚Äôs fastest-expanding big economy. Expectations for the rest of 2018 are similar.

Fans of Narendra Modi, India‚Äôs prime minister, credit structural reforms he has made over the past four years. The more plausible explanation is that Indian growth has returned to trend after a bout of political meddling. ‚ÄúDemonetisation‚Äù in late 2016, when most banknotes ceased to be legal tender overnight, squeezed growth to 5.7% in the first half of last year. New notes were printed, but last July, even as life was returning to normal, a new goods and services tax replaced hundreds of local and nationwide taxes, once again throwing the economy into confusion. At least the tax overhaul, which knits India into a single market for the first time, will eventually increase growth. Boosters speak of annual GDP gains of 8-10% in the years ahead. That would not be far short of China in its boom years. Renewed economic vim would be welcomed by the government in the run-up to elections due by early 2019. Even at 7% growth, too few jobs are created to absorb roughly 1m new entrants into the workforce every month. More than 20m people recently applied for 100,000 railway jobs, as train drivers, technicians and porters. A third of 15- to 29-year-olds are not in school, training or jobs. Mr Modi‚Äôs opponents have found that the theme of scarce employment opportunities has played well with voters. Faster expansion would help. But predictions of Chinese-style growth seem over-optimistic in the absence of deeper economic reforms. Doing business in India has become easier in some ways, such as getting permits or bringing in foreign capital. But the labour market is as gummed up as ever. Private businesses find securing land for new factories near-impossible. Whole swathes of the economy, from coal and steel to banking and condom-making, remain at least partly under state control.

The hangover from a bout of over-exuberance dating from before the global financial crisis has left companies financially stretched and with enough production capacity to be able to delay capital expenditure. A few sectors are now contemplating investment‚Äîonly to find that banks may be unable to provide finance. Loans written off or considered likely to turn sour are near a fifth of the loan book at state-owned lenders, which have about 70% of market share. The resulting losses have left banks short of capital for fresh loans, though a planned bail-out and new bankruptcy code should, belatedly, help clear up the mess. Worse, a recently discovered fraud at a state lender, where rogue employees allegedly facilitated $2bn of loans to a diamond merchant who is now nowhere to be found, has highlighted their weak governance.

Early in Mr Modi‚Äôs premiership growth was helped by the tumbling price of oil, which India imports in vast quantities. But the price of crude, which fell from $110 to $30 a barrel during his first two years, has since rebounded to $65. Any higher and some familiar problems, namely current-account deficits, budget shortfalls and high inflation, will make an unwelcome return. Yields on Indian government bonds have risen from 6.4% last summer to around 7.5%, indicating some increase in investor concern.

Although India‚Äôs growth has depended less than, say, China‚Äôs on exports, it has benefited from a buoyant global economy and an open trade environment. The latter may be changing. Indian IT firms are facing restrictions on their employees working in America, challenging their business model. And India itself has taken a protectionist turn, recently imposing tariffs on a wide range of products, from mobile phones to perfume, in an ill-conceived bid to encourage domestic production.

‚ÄúIndia is a country that disappoints both optimists and pessimists,‚Äù notes Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley, a bank. Naysayers who expected political meddling to hit the economy hard underestimated its resilience. Like commuters whose train has finally pulled in, optimists feel their time has come.

"Not in denial of state of economy, jobs: FM Nirmala Sitharaman","New Delhi: The government is not in denial over unemployment and the state of the economy, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday, adding there were clear indications that employment was rising and economy was looking up. She said there is a lack of comprehensive data for formal and informal sector employment, which was an impediment to a complete picture of the situation. ‚ÄúDid I say that everything is hunky dory? Did I say employment is not a critical criteria for, let's say, the common citizen?‚Äù she said at the TIMES NOW Summit on the theme - India Action Plan 2020.‚ÄúNot at all. And we are coming out with triggers to show where it is happening and where you need to do more. There's no denying at all,‚Äù Sitharaman said in response to a question on whether the heightened unemployment was not an issue for the government.The finance minister said six indicators, including higher employee provident fund registrations and new Mudra loan seekers, showed that employment was on the rise. ‚ÄúThere's no denying that comprehensive data for both formal sector employment and informal sector employment is absent. You do not have a comprehensive picture‚Ä¶ As a result, all of us definitely can seek comfort of our own data,‚Äù she said. She said the government had owned up to issues in collection of data and had decided against releasing such data, which it thought was faulty. ‚ÄúBut that does not mean that every data of the government is questionable that the government is hesitating to release every data related to, let‚Äôs say, employment or growth,‚Äù the finance minister said.Sitharaman also said the government was also not in denial about the state of the economy, and had been consistently working on troubling issues since August last year, introducing reforms for various sectors that could in turn spur consumption and consumer demand.‚ÄúIf the government is in denial mode, from July to February, there are people who tell me you present a budget every weekend, which means I have been acting on it,‚Äù she said. The minister pointed to the consistent recovery in GST collections, besides uptake in retail lending from banks and also rise in home bookings and increased purchases of ready to move in homes, as ‚Äúdefinite signs of positivity‚Äù in the economic sentiment.In response to a question on whether the government coffers were going empty, Sitharaman cited the 22% rise in capital expenditure, and GST collections crossing Rs 1 lakh crore each month since November 2019, as clear indicators that the economic and commercial activity was back on its feet.On the issue of banking sector officials wary of taking genuine decisions for the fear of prosecution and vigilance inquiries later on, the minister said it was the call of the banks to not seek a CBI or vigilance inquiry into a particular case. She added that in cases that were hanging fire for a long time, the banks have the option of reviewing the involvement of CBI. ‚ÄúThe exercise had already started and I hope because of these, that doubt which is there in their minds should really be removed,‚Äù she said.She added that an order from the Department of Financial Services in 2016 on holding the executive directors and chairmen of banks liable in case of something major going wrong, was also withdrawn.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/not-in-denial-of-state-of-economy-jobs-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/74109572.cms,

According to the 2011 census, the population of the state was around 200 million.The comments came in the backdrop of presentation of his government‚Äôs Rs 5.13 lakh crore budget, the state‚Äôs largest ever, which the CM ‚Äúdedicated to the youth‚Äù.‚ÄúUnder the ODOP scheme we have linked five lakh youths to banks... guarantee of employment on such a large scale is unprecedented,‚Äù said Adityanath.Under the scheme, which was launched in January 2018, one product from each of the 75 districts in UP is identified and the makers of the product ‚Äì artisans and other production units ‚Äì are promoted through loans and marketing assistance, among other means, so that employment can be generated on a district level.Adityanath has set a target of expanding UP‚Äôs economy to $1 trillion by 2024-25, from the estimated $250 billion in 2020-21, and infrastructural work is on in full swing to achieve it. The Purvanchal Expressway, India's longest expressway, is expected to be thrown open to the public from Diwali this year. While the foundation stone of the expressway was laid by Samajwadi Party during the term of the previous Akhilesh Yadav-led government, Adityanath said the BJP government has managed to make it wider and longer with lesser cost. ‚ÄúIn December 2016, the cost of the expressway that was 110 metres wide and 340 km long was Rs 15,200 crore. We are making it 120 metres wide and 341 km long and are able to make it for Rs 11,800 crore,‚Äù said Adityanath, attributing the saving to ‚Äúplugging leakages‚ÄùThe CM also said that it was through this step to do away with inconsistencies in various ongoing projects, and even scrapping some projects, that the government was able to provide money for the Rs 36,000 crore farm loan waiver after taking charge in 2017.‚ÄúOther states tried to ape our step of waiving farm loans but are now struggling to stay afloat. If you use it as a political tool without any planning and vision, it won‚Äôt be successful,‚Äù he said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/unemployment-has-increased-because-of-rise-in-population-yogi-adityanath/articleshow/74234856.cms,

View: What this Budget can offer to fix India's unemployment problem,"India‚Äôs employment situation is bad. The current unemployment rate is the highest in the last 45 years. The unemployment among urban youth (age 15-29 years) is alarmingly high at 22.5 per cent. The high unemployment rates is but just one of the problems with India‚Äôs employment scenario. The labour force participation rate has come down to 46.5 per cent for those who are 15 years and above. A large proportion of the employed workers get low wage and are stuck in ‚Äòemployed poverty‚Äô trap.While structural factors are responsible for the high unemployment rate, the current slowdown has made things worse. There is enough evidence to show that the economic slowdown is a result of the decline in demand (investment and consumption). Aggregate investment has fallen below 30 per cent of the GDP, a rate much lower than the 15-year average of 35 %. More recently, private consumption has also declined. Unsurprisingly, capacity utilisation in the private sector is down to 70%.Therefore, as a first thing, the budget should focus on reviving demand. Rural India ‚Äî especially the small and marginal farmers, the landless labour ‚Äî spends most of its income on a wide range of goods and services. So, an increase in disbursements through PM-KISAN and MNREGA can provide much needed boost to demand. In the medium term, rural unemployment can be reduced through enhanced government spending on irrigation, rural roads, cold storage, and logistical chains crucial for integrating farms with mandis. These facilities along with an extensive crop insurance can drastically raise agricultural productivity and income.Another major reason behind the unemployment situation is GST-caused distress among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who employ more than 11 crore people. GST has generated inverted duty structure (IDS) for many products whereby the tax on raw materials is higher than on the finished product. Such an imbalance reduces competitiveness of SMEs and increases cost of capital for them. Annually, around Rs 20,000 crore gets stuck with the government in the form of input tax credit. The tax has raised the cost of doing business for SMEs that act as agents of other businesses. In addition, GST on exports of intermediary services reduces their competitiveness. These anomalies in GST need to be addressed without delay.Decline in construction and related activities in urban areas is a serious concern. These activities employ more than 5 crore people. The budget should aim to revive construction activities in real estate and infrastructure sectors. These sectors directly or indirectly support economic activities in another 200 odd sectors.In this regard, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) programme is a welcome step. It aims to boost aggregate investment to the tune of 2-2.5 % of GDP by investing Rs 102 lakh crore in infrastructure over next five years. As much as 39 per cent of the funding is expected from the states and another 22% from the private sector. However, when state finances have taken a hit due to low GST collection and the private sector has very little appetite for risk, the Centre will have to do the heavy lifting, at least for now. Therefore, budgetary support to infrastructure should be much more than the NIP projections (at 1.11% of GDP).Moreover, the investment should be front loaded. Bidding and contracting for roads, highway, railway tracks and urban development projects is a lengthy process. Therefore, rather than rolling out new projects, for now the focus should be on raising funding for the awarded projects so as to complete them as soon as possible. The multiplier effects of infrastructure investment on growth and employment are large and extensive.Unfortunately, many projects are stuck due to various regulatory hurdles, and many others are mired in legal disputes. Regulatory uncertainty makes private investment unnecessarily risky and is the major reason behind non-availability of capital for infrastructure and other projects. The government should realise that for private investment, the regulatory certainty is as important as the cost of capital.Another important source of employment is housing projects. Here, too many projects are caught up in disputes ‚Äî contractual ones between homebuyers and developers, and legal ones between lenders and developers. To make things worse, such disputes are simultaneously taken to multiple authorities ‚Äî the RERA, NCLT and Consumer courts. Consequently, restructuring and liquidation processes have got delayed. Unsurprisingly, there is a large stock of unsold houses. Indeed, the abandoned or disputed real estate projects are a major source of problem for the NBFCs.A single legal authority should adjudicate all disputes arising from the real estate. The Rs 25,000-crore bailout fund for the sector should be put to use immediately to salvage all projects that are 80 per cent completed and are not under the NCLT process. To boost demand, the budget can raise limit for affordable housing for the purpose of tax exemption on housing loans.Finally, to reap the demographic dividend, there is a need to invest in skilling of the youth. In future most jobs will come from the private sector that prefers candidates with practical skills and work experience. However, a common perception is that it takes a college or university degree to get a good job. This misperception is the result of lack of an adequate and affordable vocational and education training program in the country.The budget can incentivise companies and industrial units to provide internship and on site vocational training to unemployed youth. This experience can be combined with distance education to teach the trainees relevant theories and concepts.In the interim, the government should fill the large number of vacant posts. Estimates suggest that there are more than 22 lakh vacancies in government departments. The country can ill-afford this neglect at a time when the unemployment rates remain very high.(The writer is Professor, Delhi School of Economics.

Number of jobless in MP rises by 7L to 28L in one year,"New Delhi: The number of registered unemployed educated youth in Madhya Pradesh has grown by seven lakh within a year to 28 lakh while about 34,000 youth got jobs in the same period, chief minister Kamal Nath said in the assembly on Wednesday.A senior Congress leader told ET that the number of unemployed youth could have risen as they are hopeful of getting jobs under the regime and have registered in large numbers with job exchanges.

"Urban unemployment rate fell in January-March 2019, official data reveals","NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs unemployment rate in urban areas for all ages was 9.3% in the January-March quarter of 2019 compared to 9.9% in the trailing three month period, the National Statistical Office(NSO) said in the Quarterly Bulletin on estimates of labour force indicators for urban areas on Saturday.



However, unemployment among those aged between 15-29 years was 22.5% in the quarter ending March 2019, from 23.7% in the preceding quarter.



The NSO launched the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) on April 2017. The first Annual Report (July 2017-June 2018) covering both rural and urban areas giving estimates of all important parameters of employment and unemployment was released in May 2019.



To measure the dynamics in labour force participation and employment status in the short time interval of three months, for the urban areas only, a Quarterly Bulletin is brought out giving estimates of labour force indicators. This Bulletin for the Quarter ending March 2019 is the second in the series.



As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above dripped to 46.5% in January-March from 46.8% in the previous quarter. Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also declined to 19.1% from 19.5% in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4% in January-March from 73.6% in October-December.



Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in the first quarter of calendar 2018 was 37.7%, lower than 38.2% in the last three months of 2018.



State-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6% and 6%, respectively.



Still, the labour force participation rate - the percentage of population making up the labour force - which had slowly edged up between April and December last year, recorded a dip to 36% during the March quarter, the report showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.



Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.



Drinking water and sanitation

Only around 48.6% households in rural areas had exclusive access to a principal source of drinking water while 57.5% of households in urban areas had exclusive access to such a source between July and December 2018 according to an NSO report on drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and housing condition. Almost 12.3% of rural households and 9.1% of urban households did not have sufficient access to drinking water throughout the year from the principal source of water according to the survey. About 42.9% of rural households used hand pumps as the principal source of drinking water and 40.9% urban households using water piped into their dwelling as a principal source of water during the period. 56.6% of rural households had access to a bathroom while 91.2% of urban households had access to a bathroom during the period with 50.3% of rural households and 75% of urban households having exclusive access to a bathroom during the period.



Education

The literacy rate in India among people above the age of seven was 77.7% between July 2017 and June 2018, the NSO said in a separate report. Literacy in rural areas was lower at 73.5% compared to 87.7% in urban areas. Around 13.6% of Indians between the ages of 3 and 35 never enrolled in school with 15.7% of people living in rural Indian never enrolling and 8.3% of people living in urban areas never enrolling for education. The average expenditure during the academic year for students between ages 3-35 pursuing a general course was Rs 5,240 in urban areas and Rs 16,308 in urban areas while average expenditure for a technical or professional course was Rs 32,137 in rural areas and Rs 64,763 in urban areas.



Health

Average medical expenditure per hospitalisation case (excluding childbirth) in rural India about was Rs 16,676 in rural areas and Rs 26,475 in urban India. As per the survey report on Household social consumption related to health, the expenditure in government hospitals was about about Rs 4,290 in rural and Rs 4,837 in urban areas per hospitalisation between July 2017 and June 2018.



However, in private hospitals the expenditure was about about Rs 27,347 in rural and Rs 38,822 in urban area per instance of hospitalization. Private hospiatals accounted for 55% of all hospitalisations excluding those for childbirth and public hospitals accounted for 42% of such hospitalisations. Only about 14% of the rural population and 19% of the urban population reported that they had adequate health expenditure coverage with 13% of the rural population and 9% of the urban population reporting that they were covered by government sponsored insurance. Only around 59% of boys and 60% of girls under the age of five received all eight prescribed vaccinations, even though 97% of both boys and girls in rural India had received some vaccinations and 98% of boys and 97% of girls had received vaccinations in urban India.



Persons with disabilities

In India, the prevalence of disability (percentage of persons with disability in the population) was 2.2% with 2.3% in rural and 2% in urban areas in July-December 2018.



Prevalence of disability was higher among males than females. Among males, prevalence of disability was 2.4% while it was 1.9% among females. These were the findings of an NSO Survey of Persons with Disabilities during July-December 2018. Prior to this, survey on the same subject was carried out by NSO from July-December 2002.



Among persons with disabilities of age 7 years and above, 52.2% were literate. Among persons with disabilities of age 15 years and above, Labour Force Participation Rate in usual status was 23.8% while the unemployment rate was 4.2%, the survey report showed.

"More reforms needed to boost jobs, incomes: OECD","NEW DELHI: India is set for a modest recovery after a loss of momentum as reforms to simplify taxation, lighten business regulations and upgrade infrastructure start to bear fruit, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said on Thursday, even as it pushed for reforms to create jobs and improve public welfare.Growth in Asia's third largest economy will slowdown to 5.8% in 2019 but would recover to 6.2% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021, the OECD said in its ‚ÄòEconomic Survey of India‚Äô report. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept its key lending rate unchanged and sharply lowered its gross domestic product GDP ) growth forecast to 5% from 6.1%, while maintaining an ""accommodative"" policy stance.India's economy grew 6.8% in FY19. But economic expansion slowed to 4.5% in July-September, the weakest pace in more than six years, from 5% in the June quarter.‚ÄúHowever, this slower pace of growth underlines the need to fully implement existing reforms and continue lowering barriers to trade to generate the investment and jobs India needs to raise living standards across the country,"" said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.The OECD report noted that India has greatly expanded its participation in global trade in recent years but private investment remains relatively weak, employment rate has declined amid a shortage of quality jobs, rural incomes are stagnating, and per capita income varies considerably across states.‚ÄúFurther reforms to modernise the economy are now needed to drive the creation of high-quality jobs, as well as measures to improve public services and welfare,‚Äù it said.Speaking at the launch of the report, chief economic adviser to the government Krishnamurthy Subramanian said global economic growth is significantly low, which is having an impact on India as well.‚ÄúThe global economy today is at one of its significantly low points... the current lull is particularly exasperated by a consistent attempt to downgrade the power of multilateralism,‚Äù he said.As per the report, restoring growth to the higher levels needed to provide ample jobs and ease inequality will require accelerating the pace of structural reforms to revive investment and exports.Monetary policy should remain accommodative as long as inflation is set to remain comfortably close to the target, the survey said. It called for India to ‚Äúimprove transparency‚Äù in off-budget transactions and its contingent liabilities as the government deficit-to-GDP ratio has declined but public spending programmes are being financed off the budget.‚ÄúEstablishing a fiscal council would help monitor progress toward fiscal targets and bring transparency,‚Äù the Paris-based organisation said. This comes after the government included extra budgetary resources, comprising fully-serviced government bonds, in the budget estimates for 2019-20.India‚Äôs public debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively high, the survey said. Although the central government deficit and state deficits have declined, off-budget financing has increased, it said.Reducing restrictions to services trade imposed by trading partners and by India on imports would further boost trade in services, also giving a lift to manufacturing and the general economy.The OECD estimates suggest India would be the biggest beneficiary of a multilateral cut in services trade restrictions. Even without a multilateral agreement, moving alone to overhaul regulations would have a positive impact.Doing more to simplify complex labour laws ‚Äì many of which discourage hiring by becoming binding as firms grow above stated thresholds ‚Äì would help raise the share of quality jobs demanded by a fastgrowing and well-educated youth population in a country where the vast majority of employment is informal.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/more-reforms-needed-to-boost-jobs-incomes-oecd/articleshow/72392704.cms,
Worst unemployment in decades strains Indian consumer loans,"Credit analysts are keeping a watchful eye on signs of stress in Indian household debt after unemployment rose to a 45-year high and as lenders grapple with the worst soured debt levels of any major economy.India‚Äôs bad debt malaise has centered on corporate debt, and loans to individuals have been seen as safer and a growth opportunity for banks. Given the slowdown in the economy and a drying-up of credit from shadow banks, analysts are signaling potential risks, though publicly available data on personal loan arrears is sparse.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs stress building up for sure in retail loans,‚Äù said Saswata Guha, director for financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. ‚ÄúWhether it manifests into higher defaults will depend on how the economy shapes from here.‚ÄùThe government last week unveiled steps ranging from concessions on vehicle purchases to hastening of capital infusion in state-run banks to help re-ignite an economy that‚Äôs slowed sharply on the back of weak consumption. Defaults have increased funding pressure at India‚Äôs non-bank financiers -- historically an important provider of consumer loans . That‚Äôs curtailing their ability to provide loans, and having knock-on effects for consumption, according to Fitch.Non-performing retail loans rose to 5.3% of the total retail lending book at State Bank of India -- the nation‚Äôs biggest lender -- at the end of June from 4.8% in the previous quarter. The bank has expressed confidence it can control any slippages this quarter.‚ÄúWe could see trouble among individuals to repay their loans if the stress in the Indian economy rises,‚Äù said Dwijendra Srivastava, chief investment officer of debt at Sundaram Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. ‚ÄúBusinesses in India aren‚Äôt doing well, so it may directly hit employment and in turn the ability to repay loans.‚Äù",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/finance/worst-unemployment-in-decades-strains-indian-consumer-loans/articleshow/70885502.cms,

It included 286,991 applications from 211,004 applicants (some people applied to multiple jobs).According to the study, while discrimination based on gender is illegal under the Indian constitution, conversations with hiring managers and other labour market experts have revealed that there is gender discrimination in the hiring process across the country, as is the case around the world.The study looks at three stages at which women may face barriers during hiring -- qualifications and experience, recruitment and choice to apply, and application process, while suggesting tools to increase gender diversity in the Indian workforce.It highlighted the need for gender inclusive work places by correlating it with ""higher levels of performance and innovation"".""Inclusive hiring improves firm-level growth by allowing companies to attract and retain top talent and better serving consumers in markets or sectors where women are a key customer segment,"" it said.The study also noted that increasing female participation in the labour force could increase the Indian GDP by 27 per cent.Not dismissing the progress, albeit little, that several multinational corporations in the country have made towards minimising gender discrimination at work place over the past couple of decades, it highlighted the role technology could play in improving hiring outcomes including increasing the number of women who apply and get shortlisted for jobs.""We know that diverse teams perform better, and we're encouraged by these results because they show that even small and medium sized businesses, and not just large enterprises, can leverage technology to increase the diversity of their candidate pools,"" said Simon Desjardins, Co-founder of Shortlist.The study suggested competency-based assessments, behavioral nudges in recruitment, and well-designed job descriptions, for creating a more effective bias-reducing, gender-sensitive hiring process in India.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/unemployment-rate-among-indian-women-more-than-double-of-men-study/articleshow/70908166.cms,
Data leak of unemployment figures serious: Govt,"The government Thursday admitted in the Rajya Sabha that there has been a data leak of unemployment figures and said efforts were being made to ascertain who was behind it.Replying to queries during Question Hour, Minister of State for Planning and Statistics Rao Inderjit Singh termed the issue as ""serious"" and said data pertaining to unemployment figures was leaked ahead of its announcement in May this year.He also informed members that the government has changed the methodology for ascertaining unemployment rates as a periodic survey is now being held every year based on quarterly data, against the five-year surveys earlier.""It is right that there was a data leak. Our survey result was to come out on May 30, 2019, but before that the data was leaked. We have taken this very seriously. Maybe someone has an agenda behind it and the data was leaked. We are making efforts to ascertain who was behind the leak,"" the minister told members.He said employment and unemployment rate surveys used to be held once in five years. ""This government deemed it fit to carry out a periodic survey every year,"" he said.Singh said some changes were also made in the methodology and technology was used and that is why there is a difference in previous surveys done by NSSO He said the 2.2 unemployment rate would have been same as brought out by the NSSO earlier if it was made out for five years, but this has increased both in rural and urban areas as the methodology has changed.""The new model for labour employment and unemployment is different from early methods and you cannot compare apples with oranges.""The new method now is a yearly method taking into account quarterly surveys. The only comparability that can happen is when the next year data comes. At present, it was compared to 6.1 per cent and the yearly data cannot be compared with the 5-year figure,"" he said.The minister said the government takes unemployment very ""very seriously"" and to alleviate the unemployment scenario, the government has taken a number of steps.Listing out some examples, he said the prime minister's employment generation programme itself has catered to employment of 14.3 lakh till November 30, 2018, the Deen Dayal Gramin Kaushal Yojna has helped 4.73 lakh people get jobs, MNREGA over past 3.5 to 4 has helped 972.99 person employment days.""Taking into account the seriousness of the matter, the government has set up a cabinet committee on employment and skill development to ensure that more people get jobs,"" he said.In his written reply, the minister said, this Ministry has launched a new regular Employment-Unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during 2017-18 with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design vis--vis the earlier quinquennial (once in every five years) Employment and Unemployment surveys of NSSO.These differences in methodology put certain limitations in respect of comparability of results of PLFS with results of the earlier quinquennial surveys on EmploymentUnemployment conducted by NSS, he said.""Based on the first estimates, available from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), released on 31st May 2019, unemployment rate in usual status is 6.1 percent,"" he said.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/data-leak-of-unemployment-figures-serious-govt/articleshow/70276426.cms,

"As rural unemployment rises, this startup hopes to make a dent","Others

22-year-old Jaspal was a struggling salesman from Rudiyan, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, when tragedy befell his family. His farmer father passed away and subsequently, his elder brother decided to separate himself from the family making Jaspal the sole earning member. Jaspal, who had finished his graduation despite many financial woes, always believed that there wasn‚Äôt much scope for jobs in his village. However, when the sole responsibility of the family, which included his younger sister and his mother, fell on his shoulders, he was forced to find a decent means of livelihood there.This is when Jaspal was introduced to Minimum Investment Maximum Outcome (MIMO) Technologies through his former colleague Usman. MIMO, a Delhi-based four-year-old firm, is dedicated to empower citizens living in rural and semi-urban areas by providing digital literacy and employing them in various sectors such as logistics, distribution and onboarding customers. Through this initiative, MIMO plays a dual role for both- unemployed rural citizens and enterprises who are looking to fulfil the last-mile deliveries to villages and remote areas of the country.The idea of MIMO took shape when Lathika Raghunathan, 41, returned to India after years of working abroad in software development firm and witnessed the huge disparity between rural and urban markets and the need for the rural youth to be gainfully employed. She had previously worked in the areas of financial inclusion in the Latin American markets and was seeking a similar solution for Indian rural markets. MIMO was hence formed and incorporated in October 2015 with the dual aim of facilitating enterprises with last-mile delivery and helping the rural population become a part of India‚Äôs financial inclusion agenda.Notably, the unemployment rate in India during 2017-2018 has been found to be a 45-year high at 6.1%, as per the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation this month. In rural India, 3.8% of women and 5.8% of men are unemployed. Among these, the unemployment rate ranged between 9.7% to 15.2% for educated rural females between 2004-05 to 2011-12, which increased to 17.3% in 2017-18. For rural, educated males, the joblessness rate jumped to 10.5% in 2017-18 from 3.5-4.4% between 2004-05 to 2011-12.On the other hand, many enterprises, often find it difficult to enter semi-urban and rural markets due to cultural differences, lack of local language expertise, risk of cash handling, poor infrastructure and operational issues.To address this gap, MIMO came up with a smart solution. As the country is adopting the digital technology at a very high pace, the startup believes that the unemployed and the uneducated can achieve financial independence by learning to become a part of the digital world.‚ÄúOnce they are skilled to use technology effectively, they become contributors to providing solutions to established enterprises,‚Äù Raghunathan said, adding that through MIMO‚Äôs help the rural citizens do not have to migrate to cities to find jobs and can work from the village itself.The rural employees, also known as the field agents/officers, range from school/college dropouts to someone who simply have time in his/her hands. They are trained to learn about quality and delivery parameters.MIMO works on a similar model as that of Uber and through its mobile app, the rural field agents carry out tasks given by enterprises. The app is easy to use and overcomes the language barrier as it comes in all vernacular languages. The agents have the liberty to select the tasks and depending on the tasks, the agents can earn to Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per month. Notably, the average monthly income in rural households ranges between Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,500, as per NABARD ‚Äôs All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey [2016-2017].Some of these tasks include data verification for banks and other companies in rural areas, delivering products to unchartered territories for e-commerce companies, bill payments, form submissions, surveys, and e-KYC collection, among others.According to All India Trade Online Vendors Association, the biggest hurdle for an e-commerce platform is cash collection. In rural areas, there is always the risk of a field agent running away with the money or taking his own time to pay the retailer, thereby causing a delay in cash collection. This is why many e-commerce platforms refuse to offer ‚Äòcash on delivery‚Äô option in rural or semi-urban areas. However, MIMO makes the agent pay the money to the former through his own pocket in advance. The agent pre-load the amount in the MIMO mobile wallet and once the firm has received the money in advance, it then allows the agent to collect the money from the customer which he keeps as his own. All the transactions are recorded digitally in order to bring transparency in the system.Further, to ensure a smooth and error-free service, MIMO‚Äôs in-house technology tracks and monitors the rural agents‚Äô task and the status is shared with every party at every step.For document submission and form filings, the field agents are trained to use tools like QR and OCR to digitalise relevant documents. Here, the technology also allows for geo-tagging and taking audio/video/still pictures of the documents with watermark and tags to prevent the chances of fraud and data theft.MIMO claims to have completed over 530,000 transactions since its launch and averages over $1,000,000 per month in gross transactional value.The startup has currently more than 3300 active field officers covering rural and semi-urban areas in over 4700 unique rural locations. The rural agents have served in places like Raichur (Karnataka), Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Kalandhar Garhi (UP), and Jaisighpura Khor (Rajasthan) and covered 12 states including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, etc. It is currently working with 21 established clients- Myntra, Aditya Birla Finance, Hero Fincorp, Ratnakar Bank Ltd, ShoeKonnect, Satin Creditcore, to name a few.‚ÄúFor long, enterprises have looked at their interventions in the rural sector mainly as CSR activities. They have shied away from looking at rural areas as successful marketing avenues. Through MIMO, we are showcasing that working in the rural and semi urban markets can be profitable and should not be seen only as a CSR campaign,‚Äù said Raghunathan.What does MIMO get out of this? A 20% commission from every task performed by the field agents and the firm generated nearly Rs 3 crore in FY2018-2019.In 2017, MIMO received angel funding of Rs 3.5 crore by Yukti Group . Ashish Chand, partner at Yukti Securities told ET, ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs rural segment is continually becoming the focus of every company's market strategy. However, companies struggle to bridge the huge gap that exists between urban and rural markets. Challenges such as accessibility to interior locations and variance in local languages top the chart. MIMO fills this gap via their on-ground native workforce, which takes companies right into the interiors of untapped rural India.‚ÄùMIMO now plans to expand to all rural and semi-urban locations, covering all unique pin codes in India by 2022, and is in the process of providing earning opportunities to more than 1 million people, said Raghunathan.Meanwhile, Jaspal is currently earning Rs 15,000 per month and is about to reach Rs. 20,000 within a few months. He is on the verge of becoming one of the highest earners in his village.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/features/as-rural-unemployment-rises-this-startup-hopes-to-make-a-dent-mimo/articleshow/70427362.cms,
"Unemployment major challenge, MSMEs must create 5 crore jobs to achieve USD 5 trillion economy: Nitin Gadkari","NEW DELHI: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Friday that unemployment is a major challenge and MSMEs must create five crore jobs in five years to address the issue as India aims to become a USD 5-trillion economy.Currently, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) contribute 29 per cent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and have created 11 crore jobs in recent years.Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of India becoming a USD 5-trillion economy, the Union transport and MSME minister said MSMEs will have to raise their contribution to GDP to 50 per cent and also create five crore more jobs in the next five years to achieve this objective.""Unemployment is the biggest challenge facing us. Eleven crore jobs have been created and you (MSMEs) have to generate 5 crore more jobs in the country in five years,"" he said at the 6th India International MSME Expo here.Moreover, he said the government has taken several steps towards addressing key challenges faced by MSMEs, including in marketing of their products and ensuring timely payments to them.Highlighting that e-commerce firm Alibaba had a major role in China's economic growth, Gadkari said the MSME ministry has signed an agreement with the Government e-Market (GeM) portal under the commerce ministry to establish India's new e-commerce marketing portal.The new portal may be named 'Bharat Craft', he said, adding that the online platform will be of the scale of Amazon and Alibaba.The government, he added, has set a target for the proposed portal to achieve a turnover of at least Rs 10 lakh crore in the next two years.To ensure timely payments to MSMEs and prevent erosion of their working capital, Gadkari said the government is ""seriously exploring"" if it can bring a legislation to ensure payments within 45 days of supplying a product.The minister said he has spoken to global multilateral lending agencies like the World Bank Asian Development Bank and KfW to see if the cost of capital can be brought down for the MSME sector, one of the largest job creator in the country.The three-day MSME expo at Pragati Maidan opened on Friday.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/unemployment-major-challenge-msmes-must-create-5-crore-jobs-to-achieve-usd-5-trillion-economy-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/70803933.cms,
RBI study: Over 50% of Indians feel job scene is getting worse,"The Reserve Bank of India ‚Äôs monthly Consumer Confidence Survey for September shows deep pessimism about the employment situation among Indian households. For the first time ever since September 2012, when this index came into being, a majority of respondents (52.5%) felt the employment situation had worsened. As for the coming year, 33.4% said the situation would only get worse, again the highest proportion ever voicing this feeling.About their own income, 26.7% said it had decreased. Only once before, in November 2017, had a higher proportion of respondents (28%) perceived their income as having dropped.Despite this, a majority (53%) anticipate an increase in income in the coming year; only 9.6% feel it will go down. On the whole, therefore, people are more sanguine about their own prospects than about the larger economy.On the overall economic situation, almost half (47.9%) of the households surveyed felt it had worsened. The last time a higher proportion than this had expressed such a view was in December 2013, when 54% had said the economy had worsened.More worryingly, 31.8% felt the situation will only worsen further in the coming year. Not since Sep 2013, when 38.6% expressed this view, has the proportion with a gloomy outlook on the near future been so high.The view on prices is middling, with almost three-quarters perceiving inflation as having risen and just over three-quarters feeling it will go up further a year down the line. These, however, are not unusual proportions when it comes to perceptions about inflation as the data from the past shows.The perceptions about the overall economic situation also seem to be influencing people‚Äôs spending choices, with the proportions of those reporting that their spending on non-essential items had gone down or had remained the same being the highest since Sep 2015, from which month this data is available. For the first time, over a quarter of those surveyed (26%) said their spending on non-essentials would go down in the coming year. That‚Äôs bad news for an economy already struggling to cope with a demand crunch.Interestingly, the perception is that spending on essentials is already higher than it used to be and will only increase further in the year ahead. Taken in conjunction with the perception on inflation, this could explain why people believe they are spending less on discretionary items and are likely to continue to do so.The survey was conducted in 13 major cities. These included the eight largest metros ‚Äì Delhi , Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad ‚Äì and seven other state capitals in Bhopal, Guwahati, Jaipur, Lucknow , Patna and Thiruvananthapuram. It polled 5,192 households.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/rbi-study-over-50-of-indians-feel-job-scene-is-getting-worse/articleshow/71462305.cms,

Similarly, the net new enrolments were 15.52 lakh during September 2017 to March 2018.It said that since the number of subscribers are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive.The NSO said in the report that the present report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/12-19-lakh-new-jobs-created-in-june-esic-payroll-data/articleshow/70804529.cms,
"Is the job scene in India bad? Depends on how you see it, says govt","India‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in FY18, official data showed, highlighting the challenge that confronts the Narendra Modi-led government. The data isn‚Äôt comparable with that of past years, the government contended, in effect seeking to refute previous leaked reports that said they showed the unemployment rate was at a 45-year high.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) released on Friday showed the unemployment rate in the country in FY18 was at 5.3% in rural India and 7.8% in urban India, resulting in overall unemployment rate of 6.1%.‚ÄúIt is a new design, new metric. It would be unfair to compare it with the past,‚Äù said chief statistician Pravin Srivastava.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do a retrospective analysis based on the previous methodology ‚Äî there was no (political) pressure,‚Äù said chief statistician Pravin Srivastava.He said this meant the data weren‚Äôt comparable. ‚ÄúWhen we change the matrix, it is very difficult to measure (compare) because there is no means to do a retrospective analysis in that year based on earlier matrix.‚Äù‚ÄúForty-five-year high or low is your interpretation,‚Äù Srivastava said. ‚ÄúThe earlier data was captured using monthly per capita income to measure unemployment ‚Äî now education is the criteria.‚ÄùHe also said the release of the report had not been postponed. ‚ÄúWe have not delayed the report, we have only brought in new information.‚ÄùThe data for PLFS for January to March will be released next month, Srivastava said.‚ÄúWe have brought two quarterly data on labour survey. We are coming out with consumption expenditure survey for 2017-18. We are expecting it in June. You can then compare unemployment captured by that survey with PLFS,‚Äù Srivastava said.A leaked media report on the PLFS finding in January had said the unemployment rate in India was highest in FY18 at 6.1%, leading to a furore as the country headed for elections with the Opposition accusing the government of suppressing the data.The Niti Aayog subsequently said it was a draft report that had been leaked without verification of the data. The controversy raised questions over the autonomy and credibility of the National Statistical Commission (NSC). Two members of the NSC resigned following the leaked report.‚ÄúThere is no problem with the credibility and autonomy of NSC,‚Äù Srivastava said on Friday.‚ÄúThe NSC makes its recommendation, but the ministry has to consider it. The NSC has the role to see the statistical system in entirety in addition to statistics ministry and states,‚Äù he said, adding that there is no change in the functioning of the ministry.‚ÄúThe restructuring of the ministry was approved by the Cabinet. NSC is at an arm‚Äôs length to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The internal restructuring has no impact on NSC,‚Äù he said.Former chief statistician Pronab Sen said the government will have to look at ways to revive the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to create more jobs. ‚ÄúThe quarterly GDP data is based on corporates who do not provide jobs. It is the MSME sector which has the potential to absorb jobs being shed by agriculture, and hence the focus should be on MSMEs,‚Äù he said.Highlighting the difference between the PLFS and the earlier quinquennial surveys conducted every five years, the MoSPI said the older assessments used paper forms to collect information on different aspects of the labour force. In the PLFS, information has been collected from all members of sample households using the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) method with inbuilt validation rules through tablets.According to Srivastava, another way to look at unemployment is through the consumption expenditure survey for the FY18, the results of which will be out by June end.The highest unemployment rate was witnessed among urban females at 10.8% followed by males in urban India at 7.1%, rural males at 5.8% and 3.8% in rural females.The survey was conducted in 12,773 first-stage units (7,014 villages and 5,759 urban blocks) covering 102,113 households (56,108 in rural areas and 46,005 in urban areas) and enumerating 433,339 persons (246,809 in rural areas and 186,530 in urban areas).Explaining the rationale behind the high unemployment rate, MoSPI said that with the rise in education and household income, aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen.‚ÄúThus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or workforce requiring low skills and low remuneration,‚Äù it said in a statement.According to MoSPI, there are various facets to the labour scenario and no single data source is complete by itself.‚ÄúThese data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market,‚Äù it said, adding that the ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees‚Äô State Insurance Corp (ESIC) and National Pension System (NPS) to give an assessment of changes in the formal employment market.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/indias-unemployment-rate-hit-6-1-in-2017-18/articleshow/69598640.cms,
Piyush Goyal shuns private sources showing high unemployment,"NEW DELHI: Railways and coal minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said there has been a significant increase in employment opportunities, but the current methods of data collection have failed to adequately capture this trend.

The gap was even wider among urban women ‚Äî 0.8% of those uneducated were jobless whereas 20% of women with secondary or higher education were not employed.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Friday shows the unemployment rate (% of labour force without a job) rising by up to four times between urban women who have only middle-school education and those educated up to secondary school or more (see table). Unemployment in rural areas shows a similar pattern, though the degree of skewness is less.The unemployment rate didn‚Äôt rise only with education level , it has also risen over time. The NSO‚Äôs Friday release also provides unemployment data for 2004-5, 2009-10 and 2011-12, adding a caution that past data shouldn‚Äôt be compared with 2017-18 figures because of several methodological changes introduced in the latest round of the survey.Even if exact figures are not to be compared across the four years, the broad trend across time is of rise in joblessness with level of education. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a surprise, we have known of the rising phenomenon of educated unemployment for some time. It‚Äôs just an official confirmation,‚Äù said Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India Mahesh Vyas, CEO of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, says, ‚ÄúA generation ago it was inconceivable to get a job in the organised sectors without a graduation degree. Today the minimum education required to get a job in the organised sectors is much lower and is dropping.‚Äù CMIE has been conducting monthly job surveys since a few years. The PLFS report defined educated persons as those who have attained educational level of secondary and above.‚Äò15 may be too young an age to check for unemployment status‚ÄôThe study among the educated is restricted to persons of the age of 15 years and above. Some experts believe 15 may be too young an age to check for employment status, especially in urban areas.‚ÄúIt is possible that the unemployment rate should be higher in younger age brackets as a typical educated urban youth may not even start working before 23 to 24 years until he or she completes postgraduation,‚Äù says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at Stae Bank of India .For the survey, a person aged between 15-29 years was considered as a youth.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/its-now-official-joblessness-rises-with-education-level/articleshow/69617470.cms,
India‚Äôs GDP growth hits 5-year low: D-Street wants govt to fix economy on a war footing,"NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi ‚Äôs second innings as Prime Minister kicked off on a rather sour note after a government data showed that India's economy grew at 5.8 per cent in January-March period, its slowest pace in five years.The slowdown will put pressure on the newly-appointed government and Nirmala Sitharaman , who assumed charge as the finance minister on Friday.Moreover, unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent in the 2017/18 fiscal year, the statistics ministry said, matching data earlier leaked to a newspaper that said it was the highest level in at least 45 years, Reuters reported.Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg attributed the GDP slowdown to the NBFC crisis.""Slow down in the fourth quarter GDP was due to temporary factors like stress in NBFC sector affecting consumption finance. First quarter of current fiscal (2019-20) would also witness relatively slow growth and from second quarter onward it will pick up,"" Garg told reporters.Garg, who also holds the charge as Finance Secretary, said that capital investment, including private investment, is expected to pick up.Here‚Äôs how Dalal Street experts and economics reacted to the GDP numbers:The figure is lower-than-expected and does push the case for a 50-basis point cut and more measures from the RBI . We are looking at measures to boost liquidity from the central bank.In the immediate future, the new finance minister will have to worry about revenue collection, and so she might have to take the divestment route in the near term to ensure that she is on track on the fiscal deficit front.On the taxation front, she will have to ensure proper collection and curbs on leakages. On a long-term basis, she will have to look at an overhaul of the entire system to get the economy back on track.Key segments such as agriculture, industry and manufacturing indicate slowdown. Also, the weakening jobs scenario with urban unemployment rate at 7.8 per cent and rural at 5.3 per cent are significant causes of concern. However, the fiscal deficit at 3.4 per cent of GDP, was largely in line with expectations and can be a seen as a silver lining.Considering indicative data points and scenario, we expect gradual recovery from H2FY20, led by decent monsoon , pickup in consumptions coupled with impetus from monetary policy and measures in upcoming full union budget.In light of this number, we expect some downside bias to our FY20 growth estimate of 7.2%, and the next print for Q1FY20 is also likely to be fairly weak. Against the backdrop of a benign inflation trajectory and sharp slowdown in growth, we expect the MPC to cut rates at the June meeting. The continued focus on reforms by the government and easing financial conditions are likely to support growth in the second half of the current fiscalGrowth rate of GDP indicates that slowdown in economy is much more serious than what the market feared. We expect the new government to take serious measures regarding farmers and booster for manufacturing sector.We expect the RBI may cut interest rates by 50 bps in light of this data. Market may react negatively and trade negatively testing the support at 11,600.Slowdown in growth was anticipated, but the actual outcome undershot our sub-consensus estimate. Breakdown affirms that consumption slowdown spilled over into manufacturing activity. This increases the likelihood of another sub-6% in Q1FY20, aggravated by adverse base effects. Downside risks have risen to our FY20 GDP estimate of 7%, even as some of the transient weakness corrects itself in 2HFY20.For the RBI, domestic growth concerns are likely to override global risk sentiments. Policymakers will tap the available window of sub-target inflation to ease rates by 25 bps on June 6.Statistically, we are likely to have a weak first half and relatively stronger second half. Growth is expected to pick up from the third quarter.The government has a very limited fiscal space. However, current economic conditions call for some stimulus. It will be difficult for the government to adhere to fiscal consolidation path and give stimulus. Any consumption stimulus should not be given, it should be investment stimulus.The RBI is likely to change its stance to accommodative and probability of a 25bp cut in the forthcoming monetary policy is very high.This data is definitely a big negative surprise. Growth is likely to remain weak in the first two quarters of FY20. However, it could pick up in H2FY20. Fiscal pressures are likely to continue in FY20 and hence, the government does not have any headroom for offering stimulus. We expect the final budget to be broadly similar to the interim budget. We do not expect any large-scale stimulus in the budget.""The current level of inflation warrants a rate cut, hence I believe the MPC will deliver a 25 bps cut next weekThis slowdown was quite visible in all leading indicators for the past three months. Going ahead, the new government will first have to address the demand slowdown, which, in turn, requires revitalising the credit channels.On a war footing, they will have to address the issues in basic infrastructure sectors such as power, roads and railways. More than monetary and fiscal stimulus, what is important at this stage is to undertake confidence boosting measures for credit intermediaries and improve the availability of funds for the stuck projects in infrastructure, construction and manufacturing.The onus will be on the newly formed government to give stimulus, to both consumption- and investment-led demand segments. We expect that the government would undertake rationalisation of GST rates and reviving corporate capex through offering tax breaks could help overcome the current slowing economic activity.The GDP print came in worse than our expectations of 6 per cent, while the whole-year print was also lower at 6.8 per cent against CSO's advance estimates.Near-term growth dynamics are unlikely to change dramatically. Factors like lagged impact of tighter financial conditions, sluggish private capex ahead of various domestic election-related and other external uncertainties... will weigh on the growth outlook. We expect only marginal cyclical improvement in growth in FY20 amid easier monetary stance and some consumption-led fiscal push in early FY20.(With inputs from Reuters)",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/stocks/news/indias-gdp-growth-hits-5-year-low-d-street-wants-govt-to-fix-economy-on-a-war-footing/articleshow/69600680.cms,
"Study finds unemployment rate at 6.9%, a 2-year high","CHENNAI: Unemployment rate in the country rose to 6.9% in October, the highest in two years, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Worse still, the labour participation rate ‚Äì a measure of the proportion of adults willing to work ‚Äì fell to 42.4%, the lowest since January 2016, CMIE said.‚ÄúLabour participation rate fell sharply after demonetization‚Äù, from around 47-48%, ‚Äúand it has still not recovered,‚Äù the CMIE study said.‚ÄúThe small improvement in labour statistics seen in September turned out to be short-lived. October statistics point to a continuation of the deterioration in labour markets seen earlier,‚Äù the think-tank said.The estimated number of persons employed during October 2018 at 397 million was 2.4% lower than the 407 million persons employed in October 2017. ‚ÄúThis sharp fall in the employment rate in October is perhaps the most worrisome measure of the labour markets.‚Äù CMIE said in its bulletin.The count of the unemployed persons actively looking for jobs almost doubled to 29.5 million in October 2018 from a low of 14 million in July 2017 (and 21.6 millon in Ocotber 2017), CMIE said.Commenting on CMIE's latest unemployment data, Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services, said, ""October-to-December is traditionally the job creation period across sectors in the Indian economy, and the mismatch between demand and supply of labour is hence worrying."" Annually, almost 12 million people enter the country's labour markets and job creation hasn‚Äôt been robust enough to support this, he said.He added the subdued performance of the country's core sectors such as power and infrastructure , coupled with inadequate lending by NBFCs could be a reason for the mismatch.

"Report that says unemployment at 45-year high in 2017-18 not verified, says Niti Aayog","The Niti Aayog on Thursday stepped in to clarify on the survey that claimed India's unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high during 2017-2018, calling it a draft report and that some parts of the jobs data was still being processed.The data is being collected in a new manner. That is the reason why the centre did not release the report, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said at a presser, saying that it was not right to publish the report in an incomplete manner.The Niti panel justifying its action further said that 1-12% nominal economic growth can‚Äôt happen if employment didn‚Äôt grow. The entire data will be shared by March, said the panel.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant recounted the major problems facing our economy. Lack of good quality jobs and a large informal sector is adding to our economic woes stated Kant.The Business Standard report delivered a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just months before what is expected to be a closely fought general election.The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73, the newspaper reported.The report said that joblessness stood at 7.8 percent in urban areas compared with 5.3 parts in the countryside.The data is significant because this was the first comprehensive assessment of India's employment situation conducted after Modi's decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight, the report said.The government declined to confirm or deny the report.""We have not released the report. I do not want to comment on it,"" Pravin Srivastava, India‚Äôs chief statistician told Reuters.The gloomy jobs data could be awkward for Modi's Hindu nationalist government to explain with a general election looming and opinion polls already showing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party would be unlikely to keep its parliamentary majority.Modi came to power in 2014 promising to galvanise the economy, and boost employment prospects for the millions of young Indians entering the jobs market each year.But, while India's economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually -- the fastest pace among major economies -- its uneven growth has meant that there are not enough new jobs to keep pace. And critics say the government's claims of economic success have sounded increasingly hollow.A political controversy over the survey erupted after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the jobs data resigned saying there was delay in its release.The head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission P.C. Mohanan said on Wednesday that he and colleague J. Meenakshi were unhappy at the non-publication of jobs data that had been due for release in December. He alleged interference by other state agencies over backdated GDP data.A statistics ministry official said the NSSO had submitted the report, but it was up to the government to decide when it should be released.But another senior official, dealing with data, said the government was delaying the release of the survey as the findings were so dismal, and there were plans to incorporate data on persons added in the social security network that could help improve the overall picture.Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India said unemployment in the India has been rising since 2012 but the attempts to suppress the publication of data was not a solution.""It will only create more suspicion about the intentions of the government,‚Äù he said.The last report published by the statistics ministry had shown that the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in 2015/16 from 4.9 percent in the previous year and 4.0 percent in 2012/13.The unemployment among males stood at 4.3 percent and 8.7 percent among women in 2015/16, the government data showed.Earlier this month, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a leading independent think-tank, said the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/report-that-says-unemployment-at-45-year-high-in-2017-18-not-verified-says-niti-aayog/articleshow/67775734.cms,
"Unemployment to stay at 3.5% in India, but 77% of jobs vulnerable: ILO","NEW DELHI: The International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) has predicted that India‚Äôs unemployment rate in 2018 will stay at 3.5 per cent, while China‚Äôs would edge up from 4.7 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, a worrying 77 per cent of employment in India would remain ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù against just 33 per cent in China ‚ÄòThe World Employment and Social Outlook ‚Äì Trends 2018‚Äô released by the ILO states that economic growth in the Asia and the Pacific region is expected to remain buoyant, at around 5.5 per cent over the forecast horizon of two years. India‚Äôs economy, which is anticipated to grow by 7.4 per cent in 2018 (up from 6.7 per cent in 2017) is contributing to the pick up in economic activity in Southern Asia , states the report.Yet, the report notes that ‚Äúwhile there has been strong job creation in some ICT-intensive services, notably in India, a significant portion of the jobs created in the services sector over the past couple of decades have been in traditional low value-added services, where informality and vulnerable forms of employment are often dominant‚Äù.Noting that informality affects around 90 per cent of workers in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, the report says this is only partially driven by the high shares of employment in agriculture. Informality in these countries also remains pervasive in the non-agriculture sectors, such as construction, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food services. In India, the share of informal employment has risen within almost all manufacturing industries, the report observed, attributing it partly to labour market rigidities preventing modern manufacturing from creating employment opportunities.As a result, the vulnerable employment rate in India remains high, but constant at 77 per cent from 2017 to 2019. Vulnerable employment includes the self-employed or those working in family-run establishments. Such people are less likely to have formal work arrangements, and therefore more likely to lack decent working conditions and adequate social security.ILO data shows that of the 1.4 billion people estimated to be in vulnerable employment globally this year, 394 million or more than a quarter will be in India alone.The report states that incidence of working poverty in Asia and the Pacific is expected to continue to decline over the next couple of years. However, the high incidence of informality continues to undermine the prospects of further reducing working poverty, especially in South and South-Eastern Asia.",https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/jobs/unemployment-to-stay-at-3-5-in-india-but-77-of-jobs-vulnerable-ilo/articleshow/65231593.cms,

Uttar Pradesh's Unemployment Rate Rises To A Close 10% Mark,"According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, the unemployment rate in the state of Uttar Pradesh doubled in 2019 as compared to the numbers in 2018.

The CMIE numbers showed that the unemployment rate in the most populated state of the country was hovering around 5.91% in 2018 but it grew at 9.95 % in 2019. As per the 2011 census, UP is home to nearly 20 crore people, which is over 16% of India's population.

Relation between the unemployment rate and GDP

As per official data, India's GDP growth stood at 4.5% in the second quarter of 2019. Reportedly, the decline in economic activity has resulted in higher unemployment numbers.

UP's unemployment rate was seen to be higher than that of the national average which grew at 7.7%. The unemployment rate of close to 10% means that nearly 10 in every 100 people are unemployed.

India's second-quarter GDP (July-September) growth rate stood at 4.5% -- the slowest growth in almost seven years, as released by Central Statistics Office on Friday.

The previous quarter (April-June) GDP numbers were at 5% and the Q2 (2018-2019) stood at 7%. This development comes in spite of the government's various economic moves like the merger of nine PSU banks into four, major corporate tax cuts, policy changes in the automobile sector, reduction in tax regulations to boost foreign income, attract investors and increase the consumer demand. The government currently follows the base year of 2011-12.

He was talking to reporters on the sidelines of an anti-CAA rally organised by the CPI(M).

""Since the last few months, the government has been only talking about CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens), ghar wapsi (home coming), cow and Common Civil Code which in some way resulted in religious conflict between Hindu and Muslims,"" he said.

""Although the government is claiming that the country's GDP is 4.5 per cent, it is actually around two per cent only and farmers and youths are facing a lot of hardships,"" he said.

"Unemployment Sky High, Is This 'sanyog' Or PM's 'prayog': Priyanka","Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the issue of job losses and took a dig at his ""sanyog-prayog"" remarks on Shaheen Bagh, asking whether the rise in unemployment was a coincidence or his experiment.

At a poll rally on Monday, Prime Minister Modi said the protests against the new citizenship law in Shaheen Bagh and other areas here are not a coincidence but an ""experiment"" (""sanyog nahi prayog"") and a political conspiracy to destroy the country's harmony.

Taking on the prime minister, Priyanka Gandhi said a report recently said 3.5 crore jobs have been lost in the last five years in seven important sectors.

""When PM comes to give a speech in front of you, he does not even make a mention of it. Can he tell us whether the job losses was 'sanyog or prayog'. Can he tell us that in 35 years, the unemployment rate is the highest, 'ye kya sanyog tha, ya prayog tha unka'? (Was it coincidence, or his experiment),"" she said at a joint rally with Rahul Gandhi in Sangam Vihar.

The BJP and AAP leaders keep praising themselves but do not talk about the things that matter to the people, she said.

Attacking Modi, Priyanka Gandhi said the prime minister says that the opposition does not allow him to work, but he is still working at a fast pace.

""This is true that state firms are being sold at a fast pace. They sold LIC, BPCL, Air India, BSNL and our even planning to sell railways. Really his pace is really fast. The Congress government alleviated 14 crore people out of poverty and in five years they have rapidly pushed people back in poverty,"" the Congress leader alleged.

She also attacked Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his remarks that ""we (the BJP) will make Delhi like UP"".

""I am the Congress general secretary of UP, let me tell you what he has made of UP. It was a state that had the most potential. What is the state of affairs now, the BJP government, has harassed people,"" she alleged.

""Unemployment rate in UP is the highest, every two minutes a woman is raped, every 90 minutes there is a crime against a child, everyday there is an atrocity against 30 Dalits, maximum number of murders are in UP, unemployment is on top while eduction is languishing at the bottom of priorities,"" Priynaka Gandhi said.

""This is the state of affairs in UP where they have a government and they say that they want to make Delhi like UP. There is crime, anarchy and no sign of development in UP,"" she said.

Priyanka Gandhi also slammed Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, saying it is claiming credit for work done by former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi invests Rs 5,200 crore in publicity, Arvind Kejriwal is not far behind and has spent Rs 611 crore for the Delhi polls,"" she said.

""What is the need for publicity if work is doing the talking for them,"" Priyanka Gandhi said, adding that they are doing so because they have done less work.

The BJP and the AAP should say how many roads and flyovers they have constructed, she said.

""Real issues are not being raised, someone talks of other countries, someone talks of divisive issues. One says those speaking against him is anti-national. When somebody raises people's issues, efforts are made to shut him up,"" she added.

PM's CAA & Pak Talk To Divert Attention From Key Issues: MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath,"Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Sunday hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying that he is now talking about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and Pakistan to divert people's attention from the issues of unemployment and rising farmer suicides.

He was addressing a function organised to mark the birth anniversary of saint-poet Ravidas. Nath alleged that under the Modi regime, unemployment and cases of farmer suicides have gone up.""Now, he (Modi) does not talk about farmers and youths. He is now talking about the CAA and Pakistan to divert people's attention from these issues,"" the chief minister said.

""But people of the country have understood his gimmicks...There is a lot of difference between running a country and giving a hollow talk,"" he added. Nath also alleged that more industries have been shut down than they were opened during the 15-year-long rule of the BJP in Madhya Pradesh.

""Whereas the confidence of investors in the state has gone up under the present (Congress) government,"" he claimed. Nath also assured that in the second phase, his government would waive farm loans of up to Rs two lakh of the remaining farmers in the state.

Before his address, he launched various development works worth Rs 3,000 crore.

Singh, a noted economist, also said that unemployment rate in Delhi in the last four months was 15 per cent, much higher than what was elsewhere.

CMIE Report on Unemployment Rate in Goa

A Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) report has pegged the unemployment rate in the state of Goa in November at 34.5 percent, the highest in the country. Calling the 34.5 percent unemployment rate as ""statistical outlier"", it said the government has undertaken substantial recruitment drives in its departments this year and has facilitated the private sector to flourish, resulting in enhanced job opportunities for the locals. While the government is examining the details of the report and the survey conducted by CMIE, it is pertinent to highlight several issues that are apparent from the bare reading of the report, the CMO said in a statement released here.

As per the data of CMIE itself, the unemployment rate in Goa for past years has averaged close to the national average of around 7 percent with seasonal fluctuations pulling unemployment to as low as 2.1 percent, it said. Even the unemployment figures for last month, that is October 2019, stands at 9.1 percent.

Further, a comparison with the unemployment figure of the same month (November) in 2018 gives an entirely different picture, wherein the unemployment rate was 2.1 percent, the statement said. The CMO said CMIE's unemployment data for November 2019 for the coastal state needs explanation. The present unemployment figure shows a jump of about 1,600 percent from November 2018 (month to month), it said.

In an attempt to decry PM Modi for the offences against women in the country, Rahul Gandhi had labelled India as the 'rape capital' of the world. Addressing a public rally in Kerala's Wayanad, the senior Congress said that the global nations are questioning India's ability to protect women. The statement had come amid an unfortunate upward trend in crimes against women, but the remark - and wordplay - involving a 'Rape In India' spin to 'Make In India' was heavily criticised.

Addressing a large crowd, the MNS chief asserted that the issue of 'infiltrators' is as significant as that of unemployment, education, drinking water. Questioning if India was a dharmashala (rest-house), Raj Thackeray backed the need to introduce NRC in the country. In addition, exuding his support for CAA, said that the 'persecuted Hindu minorities be brought to Hindustan'. However, the amended citizenship law nowhere mentions the term 'persecuted'.

He said, ""When minorities in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan are persecuted because of religion, shouldn't we take them in Hindustan? The minorities there are Hindus. They say, even bring the Muslims. How do we get them? I had said, we have a population of 156 crore people, we still can't disciple that. What is wrong with CAA? Now the issue is NRC. Do they think my country is a dharamshala? They are coming from anywhere, living anywhere.

Tejashwi, who is on a tour of minority-dominated Seemanchal to apprise the people against CAA, NPR and NRC, said that being the Chief Ministerial face in assembly elections and becoming the chief minister after election results are two different aspects. ""We are not selfish people. We are fighting for the rights of the poor. We are the voice of the people, who are in distress because of unemployment.

"Unemployment rate in India highest for 45 years, reason why Modi government refused to release NSSO report","A report by the National Sample Survey Office on its periodic labour force survey has said that the unemployment rate in India had risen to its highest level for 45 years. The unemployment rate, according to the survey, stood at 6.1 percent in 2017-18, reported Business Standard newspaper.

The damning revelation comes just a day after a controversy erupted over the central government‚Äôs refusal to release the report on unemployment despite the National Statistical Commission giving its approval in December last year. The controversy gained momentum after NSSO‚Äôs acting chairman PC Mohanan and member JV Meenakshi quit with both having a year left in their term.

The unemployment, according to the report, was higher in urban areas with 7.8 percent as compared to 5.3 percent in rural areas of the country.

Mohanan told NDTV that he had quit over ‚Äòdisagreements‚Äô with the government on the release of a jobs survey and concerns about it being buried in election season. With their departure the body is left with just Chief Statistician Pravin Srivastava and plan body NITI Aayog‚Äôs Amitabh Kant.

The revelation on unemployment rate will be extremely bad news for the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. In 2014, Modi had promised to create 2 crore jobs every year.

Chinese media has some advice for India to avert its unemployment,"India should shift focus to low-end manufacturing like China to take full advantage of its demographic dividend to avert an unemployment crisis, a state run Chinese daily said.

‚ÄúChina lifted millions of people out of poverty in the last three decades by focusing on developing its own manufacturing industry‚Äù, an article in the state-run Global Times said.

India should shift focus to low-end manufacturing like China to take full advantage of its demographic dividend to avert an unemployment crisis, a state run Chinese daily said.

‚ÄúChina lifted millions of people out of poverty in the last three decades by focusing on developing its own manufacturing industry‚Äù, an article in the state-run Global Times said.

‚ÄúWhether India‚Äôs fast pace of growth can persist depends on how quickly it realises that the feasible route to inclusive growth is not by skipping past industrialisation but by relying on the manufacturing industry to create more jobs, reduce poverty and create a middle class that can drive consumption,‚Äù it said.

India should be realistic in addressing its employment issue and focus more on developing its low-end industries to create more jobs.

‚ÄúSuch urgency has been raised because there is scepticism about whether India can efficiently utilise its demographic dividend ‚Äì the country is set to have the world‚Äôs largest working-age population by 2020,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúGiven the fact that India will soon or later have the world‚Äôs largest working population ‚Äì people aged 15 to 64 years ‚Äì this observation doesn‚Äôt seem like an exaggeration,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúThere has long been a myth in India that the world‚Äôs fastest growing economy could skip being a manufacturing base and move directly into a sustainable growth model relying on services‚Äù.

There have even been calls for renewed focus on the services sector in India after a report released earlier this year suggested that the services sector contributed more than 60% to GDP in the 2015-16 financial year.

But this conception should be considered wrong and dangerous, it said.

‚ÄúNot only does this argument push back against the ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 ‚Äì which aims to transform India into a manufacturing powerhouse ‚Äì but it also, in practice, may lead India into a trap where its huge population dividend cannot materialise,‚Äù it said.

Citing research reports it said the services sector absorbs only about a quarter of the labour force in India despite the fact that it accounts for more than half of GDP.

‚ÄúOn the other hand, manufacturing accounts for about 15% of the country‚Äôs GDP and employs 11% of the labour force, a job absorptive capacity that is greater than the services sector,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúFor the sake of creating more jobs to accommodate the growing working population, India should not neglect the manufacturing sector, especially low-end labor-intensive industries. This could also help absorb a large number of workers who are employed in unorganised sectors,‚Äù it said.

About India Post

For more than 150 years, the Department of Posts (DoP) has been the backbone of the country‚Äôs communication and has played a crucial role in the country‚Äôs social economic development. It touches the lives of Indian citizens in many ways: delivering mails, accepting deposits under Small Savings Schemes, providing life insurance cover under Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) and providing retail services like bill collection, sale of forms, etc. The DoP also acts as an agent for Government of India in discharging other services for citizens such as Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) wage disbursement and old age pension payments. With 1, 55,531 Post Offices, the DoP has the most widely distributed postal network in the world.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/india-post-kerala-gds-result-2020-india-post-kerala-circle-declares-result-for-post-of-gramin-dak-sevaks-gds-http-appost-in/281272/,
"Howdy, Modi! Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacks PM on increase in rejection for H1-B Visas for Indians","Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the increase in the rejection of H1-B Visas for Indians in the US. This was after a US think-tank said that Donald Trump‚Äôs restrictive policies on immigration have led to the denials of applications for H1-B Visas by Indians.

Taking to Twitter, Priyanka wrote in Hindi, ‚ÄúEveryone should ask the BJP government as to who‚Äôs being helped under its regime. Prime Minister travelled to America for his own ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô but America increased the number of rejections the H1-B Visas for Indians, willing to work there.‚Äù

PM Modi had travelled to the US to attend his much-publicised ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô event in September this year. The event was billed as Modi‚Äôs success to build a new friendly relationship with the US administration headed by President Donald Trump. Modi‚Äôs ‚ÄòAbki Baar Trump Sarkar‚Äô at the ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô event in the presence of the US President had triggered a huge controversy.

A report by news agency PTI said that the denial rate of H-1B petitions for initial employment for Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and Google in 2015 was just 1%. In 2019, the same increased respectively to 6, 8, 7 and 3%. The denial rate for Apple remained the same at 2%.

During the same period, the denial rate jumped from 4% to 41% for Tech Mahindra, from 6% to 34% for Tata Consultancy Services, from 7% to 53% for Wipro and from just 2% to 45% for Infosys.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/howdy-modi-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-attacks-pm-on-increase-in-rejection-for-h1-b-visas-for-indians/271673/,
"Union Minister Santosh Gangwar blames lack of skills among north Indians for growing joblessness, later issues clarification after condemnation","Union Minister Santosh Gangwar has blamed the lack of skills among north Indians for the growing joblessness. Faced with considerable condemnation, Gangwar, who holds the portfolio of Ministry of State for Labour and Employment in the central government, said that he was referring to his ministry‚Äôs plans to provide skills among the country‚Äôs youth.



Speaking to reporters, Gangwar had said, ‚ÄúI want to say that there is no dearth of job opportunities in the country. Those who come for recruitment in north India often complain that they are not able to find quality candidates required for the post they are hiring for.‚Äù

#WATCH MoS Labour & Employment, Santosh K Gangwar says, ‚ÄúDesh mein rozgaar ki kami nahi hai. Humare Uttar Bharat mein jo recruitment karne aate hain is baat ka sawaal karte hain ki jis padd (position) ke liye hum rakh rahe hain uski quality ka vyakti humein kum milta hai.‚Äù (14/9) pic.twitter.com/qQtEQA89zg ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) September 15, 2019

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to launch a tirade against the minister accusing him of insulting north Indians. She wrote, ‚ÄúMr Minister, you‚Äôve been in the government for more than five years. You failed to create jobs. The existing jobs disappeared due to economic slowdown. Youths are looking up to the government with a hope that it will do something better for them. But you are trying to escape by insulting north Indians. This won‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

Gangwar later issued a clarification that his intention was not to insult north Indians. The minister, according to ANI, said, ‚ÄúWhat I said had a different context that there was lack of skills&govt has opened skill ministry so children can be trained as per job requirement.‚Äù

This is not the first time that a union minister has made bizarre comments to justify their poor governance on managing the country‚Äôs economy. Earlier Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman blamed the Uber and Ola taxi services to justify the slowdown in the automobile sector. Days later, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had faced social media roasting for crediting Albert Einstein with the discovery of gravity while justifying the economic slowdown.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/union-minister-santosh-gangwar-blames-lack-of-skills-among-north-indians-for-growing-joblessness-later-issues-clarification-after-condemnation/266248/,
Secularism in danger! Solutions for Indian minorities,"‚ÄúFascism is not itself a new order. It is the future refusing to be born.‚Äù

That was a famous quote by Aneurin Bevan and it characterises the rise of Islamo-fascism in the form of ISIS, the far right in Europe and USA and Hindutva brand of nationalism in India.

Soon after winning the 2019 Indian parliamentary elections, the prime minister of India made a victory speech to his cadres where he mocked opposition parties for espousing secularism. He seemed convinced that his communally infused campaign had got a thumbs up from the Indian electorate after a convincing victory. His speech was a culmination of a string of dog whistles and actions by his supporters and party leaders during his tenure as prime minister.

Modi‚Äôs first term as India‚Äôs prime minister saw; Anti minority antagonistic speeches gaining normalcy, the othering of Muslims and Christians, cultural genocide against Muslims by using state machinery by changing the names of Mughalsarai to Pandit Deendayal Upaddhyay station, Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. Add to that killings of dozens of innocent Muslims in the guise of respecting cows, frequent attacks on Christian churches and churchgoers, appointment of extremist Hindu political leaders and known hate-mongers to positions of power, coercive ‚ÄòGhar Wapasi programmes‚Äô designed to reconvert Christians and Muslims and attempts to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity amongst minorities.

Modi‚Äôs landslide victory in the last month‚Äôs parliamentary polls has forced Indian minorities to seriously examine their future course of action for their survival in India. Chatters from minorities over ‚ÄòWhat do we do now?‚Äô are gaining momentum with some affluent minorities even contemplating leaving India.

Two-pronged solution

I would propose two courses of action for the Minorities. The first and morally right thing to do is join forces with secular-minded groups like the Samajwadi Party, the Trinamool, the DMK, the Communist parties, the RJD, and a reformed Congress party and fight to keep India a secular State. However with a sweeping mandate for the BJP despite unemployment touching a 45-year high and economic growth slowing down considerably, it‚Äôs quite clear that the BJP has successfully managed to communally hack the minds of the Hindu majority in India.

The saffron party under Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have also succeeded in communalising some government and constitutional institutions. There is a certain mass hysteria that seems to have been generated around Narendra Modi as a cult figure with his agenda of ultra-nationalism and his brand of Hindutva. Even a tweet by the BJP leader and ex-cricketer Gautam Gambhir upholding secularism was criticised by his right-wing friends including actor Anupam Kher. I am surprised he was not mocked as ‚Äòsickular‚Äô( a slur used against secular individuals).

The second and complimentary course of action for Indian minorities in times to come would be to politically mobilise themselves on religious grounds under one umbrella and seek economic rights, political representation and quotas in government and other institutions along with advocating for other fundamental rights for minorities. Currently, Muslims form nearly 15% (according to the government data) of the Indian population but they have only 27 MPs representing them which is only 5% of the total number of MPs in the parliament.

As the BJP openly declares itself as a party that wants to promote Hindutva and Hindu interests and we have SAD ( Shiromani Akali Dal) promoting the interests for Sikhs, it is only logical and fair to state that we need parties to represent other religious minority groups such as Muslims and Christians since they have relied on the currently dysfunctional and poorly-led Congress party that itself has embarked on the agenda of soft Hindutva.

Sincere and capable individuals and groups must come forward to form and lead new political movements based on religious or pseudo-religious grounds to represent the interests of Muslims, Christians and other minority groups respectively. Each new political party should avoid spreading their theology or religion rather it should be a force for advancing the economic, social and cultural rights and progress of its respective community.

I must also state that the leadership and members of these political parties must not aspire for personal glory, shun corrupt despotic behaviour, not allow the development of personality cults and avoid verbal belligerence and the use of physical violence. The leaders don‚Äôt have to be highly educated doctors, engineers or scholars rather they have to be decent human beings who have their communities interests at heart and are able to effectively represent those interests.

But we have Owaisi, Muslim League

One might argue that the Muslims already have a party based on religious grounds such as the Muslim league and the AIMIM. Personally, I‚Äôve been unimpressed with the leadership of the AIMIM as they had supported regressive ideas like Triple Talaq and are too antagonistic in their approach. The Muslim League does not seem to have the pan-India reach and influence like the BJP.

The political parties I am suggesting should preferably be borne out of a moderate progressive Islamic and Christian ideology and should have a non-political ideological mentor. Ennahda in Tunisia is a good case study of a political party that is inspired by progressive Islam while being committed to the separation of State from Religion. The political models I am proposing for religious minorities are used in countries like Iran and Lebanon and for ethnic minorities in Germany and Romania.

I must emphatically say that I aspire for a society where political parties are not based on religion.In an ideal world I am strongly opposed to mobilising political movements on religious grounds, however we can all see the BJP and its leaders openly or covertly canvassing for elections by invoking Hindu culture and declaring Islam and Christianity non-Indian faiths and so ground realities have forced me to take a practical approach to protecting minorities. The equations are simple. Hindus and compliant minorities who accept hegemonic Hinduism have the BJP to represent their interests while Muslims and Christians lack that kind of effective representation leading to their disenfranchisement. Muslims and Christians are as much a part of the Indian social fabric as any other community and against the current onslaught have to vigorously protect their communities interests and advocate for the preservation of their culture by campaigning against actions like changing the names of cities and places. In a future Hindu State or an India that is secular just on paper as is the case now by what the country‚Äôs majority has chosen by giving Narendra Modi a bigger majority, Muslims, Christians and other minorities have to mobilise themselves to chart a new course for their respective religious groups.

"Government releases scary data on economic growth, unemployment days after Lok Sabha elections","The official data released by the Central Statistics Office on Friday revealed how India‚Äôs economic growth had slowed to a five-year low between January and March this year. The contributing factor for this slow growth was said to be the poor performance in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

The CSO data also revealed that the GDP growth during 2018-19 fiscal year had consistently experienced a downward trend clocking an average of 6.8 percent, lower than 7.2 per cent in the previous financial year.

‚ÄúGDP (gross domestic product) at constant (2011-12) prices in Q4 of 2018-19 is estimated at Rs 37.20 lakh crore, as against Rs 35.15 lakh crore in Q4 of 2017-18, showing a growth rate of 5.8 per cent,‚Äù news agency IANS quoted the CSO data.

Meanwhile, the statistics ministry also confirmed an earlier report that India‚Äôs unemployment rate was at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. This came as a sharp contradiction with its own stand before the Lok Sabha polls when a newspaper in January reported the unemployment was the highest for 45 years.

The news evoked criticism from the critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took a swipe at the central government for its questionable five-year rule at the Centre. AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúModi can‚Äôt even better his own mediocre record. Record unemployment? Lowest GDP? Modi hai to mumkin hai Of course his core voter won‚Äôt complain. He‚Äôs awake only when Gau lynching falls below 5% or when young Dalits ride a horse in their wedding baaraat.‚Äù

The previous low was at 6.4 percent in 2013-2014. India‚Äôs economy grew only by 5.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018-19, which is significantly below China‚Äôs 6.4 percent.

With this gloomy revelation, India also lost the tag of the fastest growing economy in the world.

"Frustrated by unemployment, Goa‚Äôs youth whose parents were born before 1961 are obtaining Portuguese citizenship","Goa unit of Congress party on Monday launched a tirade against the government led by the BJP on the increasing unemployment in the western coastal Indian state.

Speaking in the state assembly, Congress MLA Francis Silveira said that the growing unemployment and the government‚Äôs inability to provide jobs, youth in the state were now migrating abroad with the ‚Äòhelp of Portuguese passport.‚Äô

His attack came amidst growing concern that ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô were slowly taking over the employment while leaving the local population high and dry. Locals are disenchanted with political parties such as Goa Forward Party, which won the 2017 elections promising to put the Goans‚Äô interests first.

According to an IANS report, MLA Silveira told the state assembly that due to lack of jobs in Goa, young talents from his constituency in St. Andre were turning to Portugal.

Taking part in a debate on labour and employment, Silveira said, ‚ÄúThey say there are no jobs in Goa and are migrating by taking the Portuguese passport.‚Äù

Under the Portuguese immigration laws, residents of Goa are entitled to obtain Portuguese passports if their parents and grandparents were born in Goa, when it was under the control of Portugal. Once armed with Portuguese passport, an individual can work anywhere in Europe including the UK until Brexit deal does not come in force.

They do not need to obtain any work permit as would be the case for non-EU nationals such as those from rest of India. A report quoted by IANS said that over the last ten years, more than 1,200 natives of St. Andre constituency had opted for the Portuguese passport and nationality.

Goa was freed from Portuguese rule on 19 December 1961, after the state remained under Portuguese control for m ore four centuries. In 1961, the Indian army was forced to intervene in the wake of firing from the Portuguese that killed one fisherman.

But even after the independence and its accession to India, Goa continues to follows its own civil laws.

What exactly are Modi government celebrating and at who's expense?,"The day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation, he had promised that the radical move would ensure the eradication of black money, end terrorism and counterfeit currency. The country was thrown into utter chaos following demonetisation announcement that caused nearly 200 deaths, never ending queues outside ATMs and banks, confusion within the RBI and the banks with both behaving like headless chickens on how to handle the shortage of cash.

However, the country cooperated with the government and the PM in the hope that demonetisation may be a good step for India‚Äôs overall economy and the pain will be well worth it. The ensuing months showed just how hollow the promises turned out to be.

The country today still doesn‚Äôt know how much black money was unearthed, how Jammu and Kashmir and states affected by Maoist insurgency continue to see horrors of terrorism and how much the issue of the counterfeit currency has been addressed.

What is known is that the demon of demonetisation crippled the informal economy and the manufacturing hubs across the country. The fall in manufacturing is also shown in the GDP data.

Dr Manmohan Singh in his speech in Rajya Sabha had said that the way this scheme was implemented made it not just a monumental management failure but also a case of organised loot and legalised plunder.

Besides Dr Singh, many other economists too questioned the need for taking a step as drastic as demonetisation with almost all predicting considerable decline in growth. They weren‚Äôt far from the truth as the fourth quarter GDP figures now show.

The government kept mocking all those who questioned demonetisation move and predicted economic disaster. The electoral victory achieved through social engineering in Uttar Pradesh was touted as the endorsement for note ban from the people.

The numbers however don‚Äôt lie.

Though most economists have questioned the new methodology to calculate the GDP that transformed India‚Äôs economy into the best in the world in terms of growth. The new methodology gave the government the bragging rights as the fastest growing economy. India has, unfortunately, lost that bragging right too as China has now taken the lead with their GDP growing at 6.9 percent in the same quarter.

This disappointing fourth quarter GDP at 6.1% comes despite changing the the IIP and WPI to 2011-12 base, which was largely believed would give a boost to GDP data for fourth quarter. What is equally disappointing is that the GVA growth that in the Jan-Mar 2016 period was at 8.7% fell to 5.6% in Jan-Mar 2017 period.

The GDP data, should work as a reminder to the people of the country that Narendra Modi government has failed to deliver its 2014 campaign promises. The government‚Äôs vision-less policies have resulted in the country‚Äôs inability to revive investment, boost bank credit growth or create jobs.

The GDP data aside, the celebrations and false chest-thumping around Modi completing three years in office also remind me of the claims on new jobs creation the prime minister made while campaigning during the Lok Sabha elections in 2013. While addressing a rally in Agra, Modi had famously claimed that his party will create 1 crore new jobs after it comes to power.

Three years into the government, there‚Äôs no trace of new jobs with unemployment rate going in upward direction.

The government‚Äôs own data, as reported by IANS, says that the unemployment rate in 2015-16 was 5% of the labour force, up from 4.9% in 2013-14, when the Congress-led UPA governed the country.

India‚Äôs private sector too paints an incredibly gloomy picture with the IBM joining the list of big IT firms now forced to lay off thousands of staff. IBM is expected to let go at least 5,000 staff after Infosys, Wipro and Cognizant made similar moves owing to downbeat economic scenario.

The district-wise celebration planned at completion of their three years at the Centre is yet another publicity drive at the expense of PSUs of the country. The numbers that show unemployment growing and GDP slowing is a damning indictment of the government‚Äôs failed economics. I wonder what exactly they are celebrating and at who‚Äôs expense!

"Despite demonetisation, consumer sentiment Up, unemployment rate down: Survey","Contrary to popular perception, the overall consumer sentiment rose over 210 bps to 98.75 from 96.65, while the unemployment rate fell by nearly 150 bps to 6.10 per cent during the week demonetisation was announced, according to the data by the BSE and Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

‚ÄúConsumer sentiment shot up during the week of the demonetisation announcement. In a quantitative way, independent of alignment to any political party, the sentiment was good. The next week it fell a shade, though. But we don‚Äôt know what the sentiment will be later,‚Äù CMIE managing director and chief executive, Mahesh Vyas said at a BSE seminar here today.

The survey was based on a sample size of around 10,000 households, he said.

This is despite the fact the agency claiming that demonetisation has disrupted consumption which will in turn lead to postponement in investment revival.

‚ÄúDemonetisation was a big shock and I thought data will tell that the public don‚Äôt like it but when the data came in, they said they like it‚Ä¶There is a need for us to look at this jump compared to other jumps,‚Äù he said, adding they will keenly monitor the consumer responses on big ticket consumer durable goods.

However, the week after the announcement, the sentiment slipped slightly to around 98.60 while the unemployment rate inched by nearly 40 bps to 6.5 per cent, he said.

Mr Vyas, however, was quick to add that ‚Äúthe problem is we have disrupted consumption and while disrupting consumption, we have done something more, which we have postponed quite substantially a revival in investments. We were waiting for demand to pick up so that investment picks up. Now we will have to wait.‚Äù

Overall unemployment rate in the country was at 9.19 per cent during May-August period, with the urban unemployment at 10.77 per cent, and the rural at 8.38 per cent. The consumer sentiment as end August was 101.54, from 100.1 on May 1, this year.

CMIE observed that the consumer sentiment is inversely proportionate to household income, with the sentiment among the rich households measuring 122.36 during May to August, while among the poor households it was 91.55.

Rural India recorded better consumer sentiment with 100.91 compared to urban which reported 96.35.

The CMIE data for the January-August period revealed that consumer expectations were higher than current economic conditions, indicating that they believed in better prospects for future.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/business/despite-demonetisation-consumer-sentiment-unemployment-rate-survey/78606/,
"Indian IT industry trembles as Trump pledges to protect borders from oustiders ‚Äòstealing‚Äô, ‚Äòdestroying‚Äô jobs","New US President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuy American-hire American‚Äô rallying cry has put the $150- billion Indian IT industry on edge, which is in wait-and-watch mode to see how the new administration evolves policies around outsourcing and movement of skilled workers. India hopes to have a meaningful engagement with the US, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said.

Given that US market accounts for 60% of India‚Äôs IT exports, the industry and the government in New Delhi will spare no efforts in their outreach programme over the next few weeks to showcase the role of Indian technology sector in making the US economy more competitive and highlight its contribution in terms of billions of dollars paid in taxes and creation of local jobs. ‚ÄúIndian IT companies are in 200 cities across 80 countries. They have added big value to the US, and given jobs to lakhs of people including American people there. I am given to understand that they have paid billions of dollars in tax‚Ä¶ So they have added value to America in terms of money, by way of tax and also employment,‚Äù Prasad told PTI in an interview just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 45th US President.

Stating that India wishes to have a meaningful engagement with the Trump government, Prasad said ‚ÄúWe will await unfolding of his views about Indian IT companies‚Äô outreach. We have already conveyed our views to them and we will continue (to do so).‚Äù Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar said Trump has been pro-India and understands business realities being a businessman himself. The adverse impact on job creation within the US on account of any restriction put has to be weighed very carefully (by the new administration), he cautioned. Communication and outreach will, therefore, be more critical, he said, adding that Nasscom is planning a visit to Washington in February to meet senior representatives of the US administration and the Congress. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô pledge, which formed the essence of his inaugural speech last Friday, has reinforced worries of protectionist posturing and unnerved the Indian IT industry which, as it is, has been battling headwinds of a slowing growth. Trump has vowed to rebuild the country using ‚ÄúAmerican hands‚Äù and his inaugural was punctuated with lines like Buy American and Hire American.

‚ÄúWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,‚Äù Trump said. Trump‚Äôs hardline stance on protectionism and anti-immigration is no surprise to the Indian industry. While companies have tried putting on a brave face, concerns run deep about tightening of visa norms that will push up the cost of doing business. Earlier this month, a Bill targeting H-1B visas was reintroduced in the US Congress by two lawmakers who said it will help crack down on the work visa abuse. Any restriction placed by the US on outsourcing or movement of skilled workers will have far-reaching consequences for Indian firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Already, companies have been preparing to mitigate the impact and have ramped up local hiring even if it means eating into their margins.

Hoping for a ‚Äúbusiness-friendly administration‚Äù, Infosys chief Vishal Sikka said Trump himself is an entrepreneur and a business leader and therefore, he expects that this will be the case of business and innovation-friendly regime. ‚ÄúIn the near term, we do expect there will be changes to the visa and H1-B visa policies. As policies take effect, we will consider, analyse and understand their impact,‚Äù he said. The larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has also said it is proactively addressing these concerns by making changes to its business model. Greyhound Research Chief Analyst and CEO Sanchit Gogia said better skilled jobs, including coding and maintenance, are likely to remain unaffected, given their scarce availability and exclusivity. Also, its critical to remember that most US-based companies ‚Äî including many Fortune 500s ‚Äî are deeply invested (and dependent) on Indian IT service providers and neither they nor the Trump administration is in a position to make drastic changes, he pointed out.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/indian-industry-trembles-trump-pledges-protect-borders-oustiders-stealing-destroying-jobs/96259/,
Nearly 69 percent of jobs in India threatened by automation: World Bank,"Automation threatens 69 per cent of the jobs in India, while 77 per cent in China, according to a World Bank research which has said that technology could fundamentally disrupt the pattern of traditional economic path in developing countries. ‚ÄúAs we continue to encourage more investment in infrastructure to promote growth, we also have to think about the kinds of infrastructure that countries will need in the economy of the future. We all know that technology has and will continue to fundamentally reshape the world,‚Äù World Bank President Jim Kim said.

‚ÄúBut the traditional economic path from increasing productivity of agriculture to light manufacturing and then to full-scale industrialisation may not be possible for all developing countries,‚Äù Kim said in response to a question at the Brookings Institute during a discussion on extreme poverty Tuesday.

‚ÄúIn large parts of Africa, it is likely that technology could fundamentally disrupt this pattern. Research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened in India by automation is 69 per cent, in China it is 77 per cent and in Ethiopia, the percentage of jobs threatened by automation is 85 per cent,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúNow, if this is true, and if these countries are going to lose these many jobs, we then have to understand what paths to economic growth will be available for these countries and then adapt our approach to infrastructure accordingly,‚Äù Kim said.

He said one child policy could have been reason of sharp decline in child stunting and malnutrition, which is now at 10 per cent.

‚ÄúThe one child policy could have been part of it, but anyway the point is, that if you look at educational outcomes and things like child stunting, India is at 38.7 per cent child stunting, they are literally walking into the future with 40 per cent of their workforce probably being unable to compete in the global digital economy, whereas China over the years has brought it down very, very low,‚Äù Kim said.

‚ÄúIn India, it is probably partly because of sanitation that children are often in a just constant diarrheal stage, because of open defecation. There is a lot of different pieces of it. But I have been saying to the leaders of these countries that have these high stunting rates, there is like an emergency for you, you have got to tackle it,‚Äù Kim said.

"Over 50% Saudi jobs meant for Indians shifted to Bangladesh, Pakistan in Modi govt","New Delhi: When Narendra Modi made his maiden visit to Saudi Arabia last year, it was widely hailed as another masterstroke by the Indian prime minister with commentators dubbing his act as ‚ÄòModi scoring big with befriending Saudi.‚Äù

Modi‚Äôs supporters in media and outside argued that by befriending Saudi, Modi had effectively neutralised the influence of India‚Äôs arch-rival, Pakistan. However, the latest data shows that 50% Saudi jobs meant for Indians shifted to Pakistan and Bangladesh under Modi as India‚Äôs prime minister.

The Narendra Modi government had come to power on the promise of creating two crore jobs early but half of its tenure has passed and the unemployment rate is continuously increasing. This has been admitted in the Rajya Sabha by Minister of State for Planning Rao Inderjit Singh.

Backwards are the largest sufferers. In reply to a question during Question Hour, Singh had said that overall unemployment was rising, but the rate was highest among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

Ironically, the government not only failed in creating jobs back at home but it indirectly shifted more than 50% gulf jobs meant for Indian workers to Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The complication of newly introduced eMigration system caused havoc and Saudi employers in turn started shifting the job opportunities towards neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The unnecessary formalities in visa possessing created utmost delay in e-migration clearance for non-skilled and semi-skilled workers who go to gulf countries in search of jobs.

The government data shows that there are more than 50% decrease in number of migrant workers who go to Saudi Arabia for jobs since the Modi government came to power.

In 2013, there were 3,53,565 Indians who went on job visa to Saudi Arabia while in 2016 only 65,356 could go there for jobs.

In 2013, there were only 12,654 Bangladeshis who got employment in the Gulg country but in 2016 their number rose to 1,43,913. While in 2013 the number of Pakistanis who got employment in Saudi Arabia were 6,36,721, this number increased to 7,71,867 in 2016.

It is to be noted that the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA), the Government of India, rolled out its eMigration Project to all the POE offices perhaps without taking its adverse fallouts and implications into consideration.

As a result, over half a million job opportunities from India have already been lost to other neighboring nations like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka where there is no such complicated formalities like eMigrate System or Minimum Referral Wages.

Furthermore, if this policy does not change, there are fears that India will lose to the tune of $30 billion annually in the form of foreign remittance which is one of the major sources of strengthening our vibrating economy.

India gets the highest amount of remittances in the world at roughly $70 billion, almost three times the amount of FDI that comes into the country.

By far, the largest amount comes from the Gulf countries ‚Äì Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ‚Äì which sent a combined $32.7 billion, almost half of all remittances received. Below is the foreign remittances data as compiled by the World Bank.

It resulted into steep decline in remittances from Saudi Arabia which is the largest employer of Indian workers.

During his UAE visit in August 2015, PM Modi had promised to the Gulf employers that the complicacy of eMigration system will be resolved in 30 days, but that is yet to happen.

"Indian economy in deep crisis after official data on GDP shows just 5% growth, lowest in 6 years","The Centre‚Äôs Narendra Modi government on Friday faced a real crisis in hands after the GDP data for the first quarter of the financial year 2019-20 showed the economy grow by just 5%. This was less than 5.8% quarterly growth registered in the last quarter of the previous financial year and 8% that the Indian economy registered in the first quarter of the last financial year.

The latest revelation has officially confirmed that the country‚Äôs economy was facing its worst and most prolonged slowdown in six years. The economic growth for the quarter ending March 2013 had stood at 4.3%.

The latest revelation on the GDP is lower than even the forecast made by a group of economists, who had predicted the country‚Äôs GDP to grow by 5.7%.

One of the reasons behind the huge slump in the economy is the weak consumer demand and dip in private investments. Meanwhile, India Ratings and Research (Fitch Group) has revised India‚Äôs FY20 gross domestic product (GDP) growth downwards to 6.7% from its earlier forecast of 7.3%.

Only a week ago, according to PTI, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service had cut India‚Äôs GDP growth forecast for 2019 calendar year to 6.2% from the previous estimation of 6.8%. For 2020 calendar year, it reduced the estimate by a similar measure to 6.7%.

KV Subramanian, whose Twitter bio describes him as Chief Economic Advisor, wrote, ‚ÄúGDP estimates show that India‚Äôs GDP growth, while high, has shown some slowdown. This is due to both endogenous and exogenous factors. Impact comes, especially, from global headwinds due to deceleration in developed economies, Sino-American trade conflict etc.‚Äù

"‚ÄòAt current pace, BJP govt will take 1,560 yrs to create jobs‚Äô","The Congress today hit out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, on its third anniversary, accusing it of having failed on all fronts including jobs creation.

‚ÄúThe BJP government has failed on all fronts. Their tall promise of creating two crore jobs annually too has fallen flat. Every month 10 lakh youth get added to the queue of the unemployed.

‚ÄúIndia needs to create 34.35 crore jobs by 2028, that is 3-4 crore jobs every year. At current speed, the government will take 1,560 years to create as many jobs,‚Äù Congress general secretary and former Union minister, C P Joshi said at a press conference where Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar was also present.

Joshi, who is also a party spokesperson, alleged that the BJP only believed in propaganda, politics of polarisation, false promises and misleading the public.

‚ÄúYesterday, former PM Manmohan Singh had said that the country‚Äôs growth has slowed down mainly due to demonetisation.

Maximum impact has been seen on the informal sector, the government should tell how many jobs have been lost in this sector,‚Äù he said.

Asked about the BJP‚Äôs argument that they have not been hit by any scam, unlike the previous Congress led UPA government, Joshi said, ‚Äúyou wait for some time, many things will come out of the closet.‚Äù

He said the Congress will collect proof on how corruption was going on and then bring it before the people.

‚ÄúCongress is a responsible party, we do not want to mislead people‚Ä¶.We also want to ask why no action is being taken against some big companies, who owe banks a whopping Rs 1.25 lakh crore,‚Äù he said.

Joshi said the BJP led government had collected Rs 1,32,649 crore as ‚Äúeducation cess‚Äù in the last three years and said that ‚Äúno one knows where the money has gone?‚Äù

He said that according to a report, as many as 4.7 crore school children drop out every year and government schools have vacancies of over 5 lakh teachers.

Joshi said that Aadhaar has been made compulsory for the ‚Äòmid day meal‚Äô scheme which may deprive many children from getting these meals.

‚ÄúThe UGC budget has been cut by 55 per cent from Rs 9,315 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 4,286 crore in 2016-17. Autonomy of universities has been compromised. Gag orders, slew of bans and harassment of girls have stifled opinions and discussions in several institutes of higher learning,‚Äù he alleged.

On MGNREGA, he said, the government had increased the wages by a paltry average of just 2.7 per cent in 2017-18.

‚ÄúA cruel joke is that in BJP ruled states like Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Utarakhand, the increase in daily wages under MGNREGA is an abysmal Re 1 in 2017-18,‚Äù he alleged.

‚ÄúOn one hand, BJP makes Aadhaar card compulsory for MGNREGA but only 15 per cent registered workers are linked to Aadhaar based payments uptill December 2016. This will deny work and kill the MGNREGA,‚Äù he said.

He also claimed the ‚Äòstartup‚Äô campaign India was a ‚Äúnon- starter‚Äù.

Joshi also quoted National Crime Record Bureau figures, saying they showed that kidnapping of women, human trafficking and crimes against children have witnessed a surge.

‚ÄúDelhi and BJP ruled states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have the highest crime rate,‚Äù he said.

On the Centre‚Äôs flagship ‚ÄòBeti Bachao-Beti Padhao‚Äô campaign, he said, it was a ‚Äústill-born‚Äù idea centred around fanfare, sloganeering and an ad blitz.

He said that Rs 1,000 crore of ‚ÄúNirbhaya Fund‚Äù for women‚Äôs safety and dignity had not been utilised.

Referring to the Haryana government‚Äôs move to have a criteria of minimum qualification for those contesting Panchayat elections, Joshi said the BJP governments in Rajasthan and Haryana had disenfranchised 75 per cent women by mandating educational qualification.

‚ÄúWomen in Assam are now being punished for having more than two children by denying them the right to get elected,‚Äù he said.

He also alleged that fear psychosis was being created amongst the minorities of the country.

‚ÄúBJP is attacking minorities as a tool of their polarising agenda,‚Äù he alleged. He also claimed that atrocities on the Dalits had increased ever since the BJP came to power.

‚ÄúAlso, recruitment in central government jobs for scheduled castes has declined by 91 per cent during the BJP rule,‚Äù he claimed.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/bjp-govt-will-take-1560-yrs/129117/,
"Union minister concedes, says current growth not translating into more jobs","Conceding that growth of the economy was not translating into more employment, Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya today said a task force has been set up to compile figures of jobs generated in the last three years.

‚ÄúThe current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it‚Ä¶ growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,‚Äù he told reporters here.

A jobless growth describes a situation in which an economy recovers from a recession but the job market does not.

‚ÄúBut we should also know that our country has only two per cent technical workforce, against the requirement which is huge,‚Äù Dattatreya said.

However, the Union Minister for Labour and Employment said the Narendra Modi-led government‚Äôs initiatives such as ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô aim to address this shortfall.

He said it was true that the statistics department showed that employment generation figures appeared to be on lower side.

‚ÄúBut I have not received confirmed data from 23 ministries about job creation in their respective fields. I have therefore set up a task force to compile the figures and come up with (figures of) actual employment generation,‚Äù he said.

The minister also said the current education system has too much emphasis on theory.

For instance, he said, in the engineering field 80 per cent curriculum is theory and 20 per cent is practical knowledge, while it should have been 75 per cent practical and 25 per cent theory.

"British Airways boss will not resign, says IT failure not due to outsourcing to India","The embattled Chief Executive of the British Airways Alex Cruz today ruled out resigning over the crippling flight disruption and maintained that the computer glitch had nothing to do with cutting costs or outsourcing IT services to India.

Cruz said a power surge, had ‚Äúonly lasted a few minutes‚Äù, but the back-up system of the airline had not worked properly.

He said the IT failure was not due to technical staff being outsourced from the UK to India.

Cruz told the BBC that he will not resign and that flight disruption had nothing to do with cutting costs.

‚ÄúI can confirm that all the parties involved around this particular event have not been involved in any type of outsourcing in any foreign country,‚Äù he told Sky News.

‚ÄúThey have all been local issues around a local data centre.‚Äù

BA‚Äôs GMB union has said outsourcing IT jobs to India could have made the problems worse.

The union spokesperson said it could have been avoided had ‚Äúhundreds of dedicated and loyal‚Äù not been replaced by cheaper Indian staff in 2016.

Cruz also said that no BA passengers‚Äô data had been compromised in the IT meltdown and said there was no evidence it was the result of a cyber attack, promising not to allow such an outage to happen again.

The IT failure was caused by a short but catastrophic power surge at 9.30 am on Saturday that affected the company‚Äôs messaging system, he said, and the backup system failed to work properly.

‚ÄúWe will have completed an exhaustive investigation on exactly the reasons of why this happened,‚Äù Cruz said. ‚ÄúWe will, of course, share those conclusions once we have actually finished them.

‚ÄúWe have no evidence whatsoever that there was any cyber attack of any sort.‚Äù

Cruz said he was ‚Äúprofusely sorry‚Äù to the thousands of passengers still stranded at airports worldwide.

He claimed two thirds of passengers will have reached their destination by the end of the day.

The BBC also reported of a leaked staff email revealed Cruz had told staff not to comment on the system failure.

When asked about the email he told the public broadcaster that the tone was clear: ‚ÄúStop moaning and come and help us‚Äù.

Until now, Cruz had only posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a ‚Äúhorrible time for passengers‚Äù, the report noted.

The airline is now close to full operational capacity after the problems resulted in mass flight cancellations at Heathrow and Gatwick over the weekend.

The airline cancelled 13 short-haul flights at Heathrow today.

Heathrow, Europe‚Äôs busiest airport, advised affected BA passengers not to travel to the airport unless their flights had been rebooked, or were scheduled to take off on Monday.

Passengers on cancelled flights have been told to use the BA website to rebook.

BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses, and travel industry experts have suggested the cost to the company ‚Äì part of Europe‚Äôs largest airline group IAG ‚Äì could run into tens of millions of pounds.

Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said the cost to the carrier of cancelling one day of operations was around 30 million pounds.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/business/british-airways-boss/126898/,
"Manmohan Singh paints bleak picture of Indian economy, says it‚Äôs not in good shape","A day before presentation of Economic Survey, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Monday painted a bleak picture of the Indian economy insisting ‚Äúit is not in good shape‚Äù while former Finance Minister P Chidambaram said the government is ‚Äúhiding behind‚Äù GDP numbers that are being challenged.

Releasing the ‚ÄúReal State of Economy 2017‚Äù, a document prepared by the Congress research cell at the party headquarters here, Singh said it speaks about the state of India‚Äôs economy, its many issues and where it is heading.

‚ÄúThat the Indian economy is not in a good state is obvious. Even IMF has downgraded our GDP growth and it will not be 7.6 per cent but less than 6.6 per cent,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram said the state of the economy ‚Äúis not something that we can be happy about‚Äù and expressed concern over the low credit growth which he claimed is at 5 per cent, the ‚Äúlowest in several decades‚Äù.

‚ÄúBJP is hiding behind a GDP number which is being challenged. People are not dazzled by it, but are asking where are the jobs?

‚ÄúNDA government tends to believe exaggerated version of economy, this research document is closer to truth than what government will say tomorrow,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram said every government must be optimistic, but optimism must stem from a realistic assessment of situation.

‚ÄúYet, if government presents tomorrow a rosy picture of the economy, people of India are entitled to question that.

There are no jobs, capital formation is declining, credit growth is the lowest in several decades,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram wanted government to focus on fiscal consolidation and said, ‚Äúthere are serious question marks on this government‚Äôs ability to follow fiscal prudence‚Äù.

He dismissed suggestions that the 2008 farm loan waiver was a populist measure, saying, ‚ÄúIt was based on the response to a demand from the farming community and was a very wise decision.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was especially so as the international financial crisis hit in September 2008, which crippled even major economies but did not affect India much,‚Äù he said.

He claimed that while there are no jobs, new capital investment and no credit growth, the document released ‚Äúcandidly, truthfully‚Äù assesses the state of India‚Äôs economy, supported by hard research and data.

Hoping that government will not cut social sector spending, the former Finance Minister claimed that the MNREGS was the lone scheme that provided some succour to poor by way of jobs.

‚ÄúThere is a 60 per cent spurt in demand for MNREGS jobs.

If they are cut, then it would be a very cruel cut. This demand is because of loss of jobs and. I sincerely hope that this government will not make this cardinal mistake of cutting expenditure,‚Äù he said.

Congress spokesperson Rajiv Gowda said, ‚ÄúThe slowdown in the Indian economy in the wake of demonetisation will last four to five years.‚Äù

He told the government that it should not use the issue of universal basic income tax an excuse to attack social safety net.

Rejecting Congress‚Äô charge, the BJP said India has become the fastest growing major economy under the leadership of Narendra Modi and the current account deficit will be eliminated in the next few months.

India has evolved as an oasis of economic growth stability and opportunity in the world under Modi government from one of the most fragile economies during the Congress regime, senior BJP leader and Power Minister Piyush Goyal said here.

Addressing media at the BJP headquarter soon after Congress briefing on the state of economy, Goyal said it is in strong hands and the Modi government has done historic work in strengthening all the macroeconomic parameters.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/economy-not-good-shape/98027/,
Govt cracking down on illegal recruitment agencies for overseas jobs,"The Centre is coming down ‚Äúhard‚Äù upon illegal recruitment agencies for overseas jobs, especially for the gulf region, Minister of State for External Affairs V K Singh said in Bengaluru on Sunday. The Minister said the department will be creating a national repository that can be used by foreign employer or officials for verification of educational qualification of those seeking employment or employed abroad.

‚ÄúWe are coming down hard on illegal recruitment because we still find lot of agents who are not registered; they are able to fool people by showing them‚Ä¶what they will get abroad,‚Äù Singh said. He said, ‚ÄúThey take them on all kinds of routes. You will be surprised that lot of these domestic sector workers go on tourist visas‚Ä¶..we are taking action against them.‚Äù

Singh was responding to a question by a delegate from a Gulf country during a session on ‚ÄúConsular services to overseas Indians: Ensuring effective and efficient delivery‚Äù at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas conclave in Bengaluru. Responding to a question on educational qualification related issues faced by those seeking employment abroad, the minister said they were creating a national repository which can be used by foreign officials or employers to verify the credentials of the employee.

‚ÄúOn the verification of educational qualification‚Ä¶.we are finding a permanent solution to this problem by creating a national repository which will have all the qualifications and data base from where anybody in the world can pickup and verify,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúYou will have that done very soon.‚Äù

Speaking about the steps being taken by the government to address the grievances, complaints and petitions of the migrant workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the PBD-2017 earlier today said that strict action is being taken against illegal recruitment agents in India. Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh were some of the steps in this direction, he said.

On women housemaid issue, Singh said government has taken a very clear decision that no lady or a women worker less than 30 years of age will go outside the country.

‚ÄúWoman workers whether they have been recruited for any job will only go through the agencies established by the state government, so that no illegal recruitment takes place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith this condition that we have laid down of women workers of less than 30 years will not go out and second as a policy we have said that wherever we find fault we will charge those people for trafficking, that will ensure very strict legal action again such offenders,‚Äù he added.

‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs income will go up by 27 pc with women participation‚Äô,"India‚Äôs national income would increase by 27 per cent if the participation of women in the workforce matches the level of men, IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde has said.

Delivering a speech on ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Empowerment: An Economic Game Changer‚Äù in Los Angeles, 60-year-old Lagarde said equal pay and better economic opportunities for women boost economic growth and create a bigger pie for everyone to share.

‚ÄúEmpowering women can be an economic game changer for any country. For instance, if women were to participate in the labour force to the same extent as men, national income could increase by five per cent in the US, nine per cent in Japan, and 27 per cent in India,‚Äù she said yesterday.

Better opportunities for women also promote diversity and reduce economic inequality around the world, she added.

‚ÄúTo put it differently: if you discourage half the population from fully participating in the labour market, you are essentially behaving like an airline pilot who shuts down half his engines in mid-flight. Sure, your plane will likely continue to fly, but it would be such a crazy thing to do,‚Äù Lagarde said.

Noting that across the globe women were still facing a triple-disadvantage and are less likely than men to have a paid job, Lagarde said only half of the world‚Äôs working-age women were employed.

‚ÄúIf they do find paid employment, it is more likely to be in the informal sector. And if they eventually get a job in the formal sector, they earn, on average, three-quarters as much as men even with the same level of education, and in the same occupation,‚Äù she said.

Lagarde said governments have a key role to play when it comes to economic incentives that provide women a fair shot in the labour market.

‚ÄúWe need to promote affordable childcare, parental leave, and workplace flexibility. We need to increase women‚Äôs access to finance and remove legal barriers that still exist in most countries,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe also need to push for smarter tax policies, including here in the US. Think of tax reforms to help low-income families, which are disproportionately headed by women. And think of the benefits of reducing taxation on secondary earners in households, who are again mostly women,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúSo if you add up all things that can be done in each country, you get a powerful global impact. A global economic game changer,‚Äù Lagarde said, adding that most important countries have understood the need for gender equality, including the G20 grouping that account for 85 per cent of the world GDP and two-thirds of its population.

‚ÄúThese countries, including the US, have pledged to reduce the gap in women‚Äôs labour force participation by 25 per cent by the year 2025 which would create an estimated 100 million more jobs by 2025. This would be a huge impetus to growth and would reduce poverty and inequality,‚Äù Lagarde said.",http://www.jantakareporter.com/india/indias-income/76084/,
Skill India campaign: Manish Sisodia takes potshots at Centre,"Taking a dig at the Centre for using Sachin Tendulkar as brand ambassador for Skill India campaign and highlighting only carpentry, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said a complete change in mindset is required to make millions of youth entering the job market fully equipped.

‚ÄúWhen we talk about skill, the biggest problem is the educated class has confined its definition to thinking that skill means carpenter, skill means welding. Interesting thing is that by using a brand ambassador like Sachin Tendulkar for Skill India, what kind of advertisements did we make, what kind of skills were promoted? We promoted skill like carpentry,‚Äù Sisodia said while speaking at the India Economic Summit here.

Calling for a holistic approach to the issue, Sisodia said: ‚ÄúI am not demeaning anything, but if we have to think about the future of Skill India, if we have to skill each and every student who are passing out from 10th or 12th class, we can‚Äôt ask each and every parent in this country to send their son or daughter to become a carpenter or a welder.‚Äù

In April this year, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship had roped in Tendulkar to endorse its ambitious initiative of skilling 40.2 crore youth of the country by 2022 under its Skill India campaign.

Elaborating, the deputy chief minister said a broader outlook is need where skilling covers a wide variety of areas such as hospitality, retail or even providing delivery services for the burgeoning e-commerce sector.

‚ÄúWe have to have a clear vision. Right now, as a nation, as a society, I don‚Äôt think we have a clear vision over skill.

Because of this, sometimes we call it ITI, sometimes polytechnic, sometimes certificate course. We don‚Äôt call it skill in totality. We have never thought about it in totality and that‚Äôs where we are stuck,‚Äù Sisodia added.

Equal emphasis must be given to smaller aspects like driving, security guard, salesperson at a retail shop, or a waiter.

Airing similar views, LinkedIn Corporation India Managing Director Akshay Kothari said: ‚ÄúAlthough initiatives like Skill India are steps in the right direction, if you ask those who got skilled, most of them are having a problem in getting a gate, from getting an opportunity.‚Äù

He further spoke of how a lot of college students have spent the family‚Äôs fortune to get a college degree and now are struggling to get a job.

‚ÄúIndia is producing eight million college graduates every year and studies have shown that more than half of them are unemployable,‚Äù Kothari said.

Citing the World Bank report which stated that 69 per cent of jobs in India are threatened by automation, he said: ‚ÄúWe have a problem here where college students are getting a college degree, but not getting a job. People are getting skilled, but not getting a gate, and people who actually have jobs are threatened by automation.‚Äù

The email said, ‚ÄúThis was a difficult decision for us to arrive at and we feel the disappointment of students. At the same time, it is important for us to land our campus hires into Flipkart at the right time and into meaningful roles which gives them opportunity to learn and grow.‚Äù

Is unemployment in India really at 45 years high: Explaining the NSSO report,"Currently the news about unemployment in India touching a ‚Äú45 years high‚Äù has been circulating in print and electronic media. The news was also picked up by foreign media and appeared across many publications in USA, Europe and Middle East.

However, the NSSO report requires a more nuanced analysis than just a sensational headline. Before comparing the outcome of this survey with any data points in the past, the following additional parameters should be taken into consideration.

New methodology / New sampling criteria

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Till 2012, jobs data was based on Employment Unemployment Survey (EUS) which was conducted once every 5 years. After 2016, jobs data are now based on Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) which measures quarterly changes in labor market.

In EUS 2011-12, households for survey were selected based on levels of livelihood (rural) and expenditure (urban). However, in PLFS 2017-18, households for survey were selected based on the levels of education.

Issues with the new sampling technique

There are two issues with this basis of sampling.

First, the sample selection impacts the outcome. In statistics, samples need to be random. It is discouraged to select a sample based on a criterion that itself affects the behavior that one is trying to explain.

To illustrate through a crude analogy, let‚Äôs consider a survey for election results. For this the surveyors select ‚Äúhouseholds with number of family members that support AAP‚Äù with 0, 1, 2+ members as 25%, 50% and 25% weightage respectively.

This would ensure that sample of households where no one supports AAP (0 option) gets only 25% representation, whereas supporters (1 or 2+) get 75% weightage. This survey would predict good support for AAP, but it may not be the ground reality because of the inherent problem with sample selection criteria that directly impact the outcome.

Similarly, Education level directly affects labor market participation hence the outcome of survey is expected to be skewed.

Secondly, sample weightage is not aligned with ground realities.

In India, the number of households where NO ONE in the family has attained secondary level education is 75% (for rural) and 46% (for urban). However, in NSSO survey sample, only 25% of selected households represent low education.

Effectively, people with lower levels of education who comprise a much larger section of actual workforce (66%) have been grossly under-represented (25%) in the survey sample.

Impact of the new sampling technique

In India, joblessness rises with education level.

The data from 2011 census shows that unemployment numbers are higher for people with higher education (15%) compared to those with lower education (8%).

A report by World Economic Forum (WEF) also showed similar trend. Unemployment was more than 8% for graduates and post graduates. It was only 1% for people with less than primary education.

The reason for this phenomenon is explained by the fact that in India, 90% of the jobs are in unorganized sector like construction, daily wage workers, taxi drivers, small time retailers, casual contract workers and self-employed professionals. Less educated section of the workforce is more likely to take up such jobs. Consequently, the higher the education level attained, the more people are unemployed.

Either NSSO should not have used education level as the criterion for sample (because education level directly impacts the outcome of unemployment data) or the sample sizes should have been inline with the population data.

Since NSSO survey includes more households with higher education, unemployment data is showing a sudden jump.

Other prominent inaccuracies in the data

The report indicates that in the last six years, unemployment suddenly increased from 2.1% to 6.1% (a ‚Äú45 years high‚Äù).

At the same time, the report also indicates that in the last six years, India‚Äôs population has decreased by 1.3% and is now at just a little over 1 billion. Urbanization has also decreased by 5.8%.

Both these are incorrect because in reality, both the population and urbanization have been constantly increasing. Per census, India‚Äôs population is estimated at 1.3 billion (not 1.074 billion). These counter intuitive outcomes indicate to some structural fault with method / data which is yielding unreliable outcomes.

Is unemployment really at 45 year high?

In India, jobs data is published by multiple agencies / sources including ‚Äì

NSSO survey data (once every 5 years)

Labor Bureau Reports

CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy), a non-govt agency that publishes monthly data

United Nations ILO (International Labor Organization) Reports

EPFO publishes monthly data on subscriber additions

CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) data from Industry

Of these, CII estimates that MSME industries created 14 million jobs every year in last four years. As per United Nations ILO‚Äôs ‚ÄòWorld Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2018‚Äô report, from 2016 to 2019 unemployment in India remained largely at the same 3.4% to 3.5% level.

Different agencies use different methods and arrive at different data points for unemployment in India. PLFS has been used for the first time and it is unfair to compare its outcome (6.1%) with any other data point in the past.

Still if one were to persist in apples to oranges comparison, it must be noted that as per the last census in 2011, unemployment at every segment of workforce varied from 7% to 15%. Overall unemployment was as high as 9.6%.

If unemployment in 2011 was 9.6%, then it is definitely inaccurate to claim that at 6.1% unemployment in 2018 is at 45 years high.

Summary:

Yes, India needs a relentless focus on job creation. Almost 5 million Indians are entering work force every year and India needs to constantly create new jobs. Specifically, India needs to create high quality and higher paying jobs in the formal organized sector which is where the higher educated workforce can make bigger contribution to the economy.

India also needs to increase education attainment levels. Forbes indicates that India is creating millions of high skilled jobs, but many are not finding enough skilled workers.

Yet, 6.1% unemployment in India is not an earth-shattering number by itself. A look at currently world‚Äôs Top 15 economies indicates that unemployment in France, Italy, Brazil and Spain is at 8%, 10%, 12% and 14% respectively. These are high but not enough to start ringing alarm bells.

All in all, even at 6.1% as measured by the new methodology, unemployment in India is NOT at ‚Äú45 years high‚Äù. That‚Äôs a meaningless exaggeration without any basis in facts or data.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/06/is-unemployment-in-india-really-at-45-years-high-explaining-the-nsso-report/,
‚ÄòUnemployment at 45 year high‚Äô is fake liberal fantasy based on an obviously wrong data,"There is an old saying that if you have a favourite food, never find out how it‚Äôs made. You may no longer be able to eat it.

Today we will apply the same principle to liberals‚Äô favourite ‚Äòfact‚Äô about the Indian economy: the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô that shows that unemployment has reached a 45 year high.

Today we will find out how this number was calculated (cooked?). What are the components that went into this number?

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

So let me tell you some ‚Äòfacts‚Äô about India.

Did you know who was the greatest beneficiary of demonetization? It was the casual workers, the ones who work in the informal sector and have to live on daily wages that are mostly paid in cash.

And do you know who suffered the most? It was salaried workers, usually the ones who get their pay credited directly to their bank accounts every month by their employer.

When demonetization hit, the formal economy apparently ran out of internet connections. Instead, the informal economy did very well, apparently because demonetization increased the availability of ready cash they do business in.

Don‚Äôt believe me? I‚Äôm not kidding. The ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô actually found this. Real wages (i.e, inflation-adjusted wages) of casual workers are up by 22% between 2011 and 2017. On the other hand, the real wages of salaried workers are down by nearly 20% since 2011 and 2017.

Thank you demonetization for ushering in economic justice on a scale unprecedented in world history. And thank you, Surjit Bhalla, for uncovering all the good news in the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô.

You‚Äôve all heard about the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô. The one that Modi sarkar is apparently trying to suppress. You know, the one that supposedly shows unemployment in India has reached a 45 year high. The liberal media just can‚Äôt stop talking about it.

But what the liberal media won‚Äôt tell you is how much good news is there in the same ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô.

For instance, did you know just how well the rural economy is doing? It‚Äôs going so good that people are leaving the cities and going back to villages to enjoy the boom in the rural economy. According to ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô, India‚Äôs urbanization has dipped from 31% in 2011 to 29% now!

Rural distress? What rural distress?

And to think that all our media have left behind their comfortable homes in Lutyens Delhi to understand the ‚Äòrural distress‚Äô in the countryside. Come back! Stop wasting your time. Come back to the big city, which is now less crowded according to ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô! Leave the crowded villages behind and come back to our empty cities!

As if that was not good news enough, did you know that India‚Äôs population has declined too? The ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô also finds that India‚Äôs population is just 107 crore people and not 130 crore people.

There is only one explanation for this is that 23 crore Indians must be currently on vacation abroad, enjoying the sights of New York and Paris. And liberals say the economy isn‚Äôt doing well! Come on!

Defines belief? Yes! But these are the numbers that went into calculating (cooking?) the number of ‚Äòunemployment at 45 year high‚Äô. You can‚Äôt choose to believe the headline number and refuse the components that went into it.

What is shocking is that until now, nobody in media or intelligentsia seems to have put in the bare minimum effort to carry out a sanity check on the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô. The media simply ran with it and the secular establishment was only too happy to weaponize the headline into a stick to beat the government with.

You might remember that recently an ‚Äòauspicious‚Äô number of economists wrote an open letter attacking the government over these supposed figures. These were supposed to be scholars, people with research credentials, people who have been trained to read beyond the headlines and cross-check facts. Could they not have caught these obvious mistakes in the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô with five to ten minutes of effort? But they didn‚Äôt. They jumped on the propaganda bandwagon. No surprise that most of these ‚Äôeminent economists‚Äô were members of the left-liberal complex, some had signed up with their entire families and academic descendants and some were even associated with the Congress campaign.

This is a betrayal of the trust of the Indian people in media and intelligentsia on a scale never seen before.

Propaganda newspapers, propaganda news channels and propagandist intellectuals created a storm of outrage around a piece of ‚Äòunemployment data‚Äô that was obviously wrong.

There is only one question left to ask. How did NSSO make such massive and glaring mistakes? Surjit Bhalla attributes this to a bizarre change in sampling and survey methods. Very well, that‚Äôs one possibility. But considering the scale on which the ‚Äòleaked data‚Äô was publicized and used as a propaganda weapon, we common people have to consider other possibilities. Was their deliberate malpractice involved? Did deep assets in the bureaucracy try to help a certain political party by rigging the data or the methods of data collection? We don‚Äôt know. But we do have a right to ask.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/04/unemployment-at-45-year-high-is-fake-liberal-fantasy-based-on-an-obviously-wrong-data/,
Unemployment soars in Madhya Pradesh,"Days after Congress-friendly organisation, CMIE, which allegedly has close links to Congress and P Chidambaram, gave a thumbs up to Congress‚Äô Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government by claiming there is 40% drop in unemployment, the actual figures say otherwise. The number of registered unemployed youth in Madhya Pradesh has grown by seven lakh in just a year taking it to 28 lakh while about 34,000 youth got jobs in that one year.

As reported by Economic Times, the rise in number of registered unemployed youth could be the poll promise Congress made ahead of 2018 state assembly elections wherein they promised Rs 4,000 unemployment allowance to unemployed youth. While campaigning in the state for the assembly elections, then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had announced last year that the unemployed youth in the state will be provided with an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month. In February this year, the Kamal Nath government had announced that the young men and women in urban areas will receive an amount of Rs 4000 per month and under another plan, they will be provided work for a minimum of 100 days. However, in July this year, Kamal Nath had done a u-turn on his poll promise and said that the government has no plan to give unemployment bonus to the youth in Madhya Pradesh.

In Madhya Pradesh, the total registered unemployed youth were 20,77,222 in October 2018 which rose to 27,79,725 in October, 2019 just days after CMIE report showed 40% drop in joblessness in Madhya Pradesh. In fact, Kamal Nath‚Äôs office had even patted their back for bringing down unemployment in the state. Madhya Pradesh Labour Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia had termed it a ‚Äògreat achievement‚Äô and had urged the Centre to learn from the state as per the Times of India report.

Shah has been accused of accessing data from NSE on a preferential basis in connivance with the authorities and sharing this data with certain stockbrokers for use in High-Frequency Trading. The scam is being investigated by SEBI, CBI as well as by Income Tax authorities. The current MD of CMIE is Mahesh Vyas, who happens to be the brother-in-law of Ajay Shah.

Hours after the NSSO report came out in media, the NITI Aayog clarified that it was a draft report which is still being processed and that the data in the report is not finalised.

NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said that the Government did not release the data which is still being processed and will release the report when it is ready. The government think-tank said that the Employment Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data shows that 4.8 million additional jobs have been created. ‚ÄúData collection method is different now we are using a computer-assisted personal interviewee in the new survey.

CMIE report says 4 million jobs added in last one year,"The Congress party and its ecosystem had aggressively latched on to ‚Äòunemployment‚Äô bogey with questionable sets of data on jobs to try and push Narendra Modi government into a corner ahead of the 2019 elections. One of the sources that the opposition used to claim job loss was a report by CMIE, an organisation allegedly close to the Congress party and P Chidambaram. Their survey had claimed that nearly 10 million jobs were lost during the year 2018.

CMIE has published its latest report on employment, and it suggests that job loss has stopped and employment has started increasing in the country. According to their latest report, 4 million jobs have been added in the last year, hinting at a recovery of employment opportunities in the country.

In his new report, released post elections, CMIE says that there has been an increase in employment in the country with more than 405 million people have been employed during May-August 2019 compared to 401 million people who were employed during the September-December in 2018. This report claims that there has been a turnaround in employment from a steep falling trend to a gradually rising trend.

The report further states that out of the 405 million employed in the country, 129 million people belonged to Urban areas while 276 million people were employed in rural areas.

‚ÄúThe 405 million people estimated to be employed during the May-August 2019 were 0.6 million higher than the employed during the January-April 2019 and 3.9 million higher than the preceding survey conducted during September-December 2018,‚Äù states CMIE survey. ‚ÄúCumulatively, the count of the employed has risen over 4 million over the past three surveys,‚Äù writes Mahesh Vyas in his report.

The employment report states there is an increase in employment by at least 2.5 million in one year, comparing May-August number for 2019 with the same period in 2018, taking off the effects of seasonality.

However, the report also states that although the number of employed has increased, it is far from sufficient. It says that an increase in 2.5 million jobs only absorbed 22 per cent of the people who sought jobs during the time period. According to the report, the labour force increased by 11.3 million while only 2.5 million jobs were provided in last one year from May-August 2018 to May-August 2019.

Mahesh Vyas further reports that in 2019, there is a rise in the number of unemployed with the continued growth of employment opportunities in the country in the last year. But he says that there is a reason to celebrate the increase in the unemployed, as their increase is an indication of an increase in the hopes for finding jobs.

He also says that the economy seems to be recovering from the disruptions of demonetisation and GST implementation. But the recovery in jobs is extremely fragile and tentative.

The report states that although the number of employed has risen to 405 million, it was 408 million in May-August in 2016, which means the economy is yet to provide employment at the same scale.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/10/cmie-job-survey-employment-recovery-4-million/,
Here is why comparing the recent job data with past data is faulty and foolish,"In January this year, some data on jobs from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) was leaked, which had created a big furore in the country. Based on the leaked incomplete data, several media houses and intellectuals had claimed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate for the year 2017-18 was at the highest level in 45 years. Opposition parties had used such analysis based on incomplete leaked data to attack the government before and during the Lok Sabha elections.

Today the Periodic Labour Force Survey report was officially released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Going through the same, it can be said that there can be nothing farther away from the truth than saying that unemployment in India is at a 45 year low! The report confirms the leaked figure of 6.1% unemployment rate, but there are crucial details which make the difference. The report shows that the method to calculate jobs data has been changed, hence it can‚Äôt be compared with past data.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Past jobs data was measured using the expenditure of households as a criterion. The current jobs data uses education as a criterion instead of expenditure. This means this has become a perfect ‚Äòapples to oranges‚Äô comparison.

In India, the labour force surveys (Employment and Unemployment Surveys or EUS) have usually been bundled along with the household Consumer Expenditure Survey, conducted typically once in 5 years. The employment and unemployment surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey till 2011-12 used the monthly per capita expenditure of the household in the selected villages/blocks as a basis for stratification of households.

In the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted for the year 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

This change in criteria from monthly per capita expenditure to education levels has direct implications on the comparability of the results of PLFS with the EUS of earlier years. In view of this, the PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis.

It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen. Thus, they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or workforce requiring low skills and low remuneration. The PLFS results give the distribution of educated and unemployed persons across the country which can be used as a basis for skilling of youth to make them more employable by industry.

There are various facets to the employment and unemployment scenario and no single data source is complete by itself. These data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market. In this direction, the Ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to EPFO, ESIC and NPS to give an assessment of changes in the formal market employment. The PLFS survey data complemented by administrative data and data from other sources need to be triangulated to get a complete picture.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/06/comparing-the-recent-job-data-with-past-data-is-faulty-and-foolish-analysis/,
How realistic is Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs target of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024,"India‚Äôs Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi has declared his vision of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024. The hallmark of visionary leaders is that they set audacious targets and then achieve them. However, the roadmap to achieve this goal is not devoid of its share of challenges. A deeper look into the current economic situation and required growth rates to achieve this milestone would reveal that this would be a ‚Äústretch goal‚Äù which is achievable but not without significant action on economic reforms.

As per the published data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India‚Äôs GDP in 2018 was $2.7 trillion. IMF forecast for India‚Äôs GDP in 2024 is $4.7 trillion. These estimates are in-line with Morgan Stanley which forecasts India‚Äôs GDP to touch $5 trillion by 2025.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

The INR/USD exchange rate assumed by the IMF for future years in the above analysis is shown in the table below. The green cells contain data taken from IMF and white cells show the calculated values.

From the IMF estimates above, it can be inferred that if ‚Äì

India‚Äôs nominal GDP grows at about 11.8% per year

and inflation hovers at around 4% to 4.2% per year (hence real GDP growth = 7.6% to 7.8% per year)

and INR depreciates at no more than 2% per year (INR/USD exchange rate in 2024 is less than 79)

Then India‚Äôs nominal GDP would be approximately $4.7 trillion in 2024.

The size of the economy in 2024 could exceed $4.7 trillion, if the GDP growth rate picks up or if Rupee stays stronger than the above estimates. For example, if real GDP grows at 7.6% per year, but the currency exchange rate in 2024 stays at the levels of INR 75 per USD then nominal GDP would hit $4.9 trillion in US dollar terms.

Challenges

Unfortunately, the global economy is currently going through a slowdown as all major economies of the world are facing headwinds. As of 2019, USA is facing an economic slowdown. China‚Äôs GDP growth is at 27 years low and Industrial Output is at 17 years low. Germany is facing a recession (not a slowdown of growth, but actual CONTRACTION of the economy). France‚Äôs growth is declining across industries. In Britain, investments are down to 17 years low. Japan‚Äôs factory output has slumped. Australia‚Äôs GDP growth is at 20 years low. Singapore is facing a recession. South Korea exports are down for 8 consecutive months and the world economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis of 2008.



With all major economies of the world going through turbulence, India‚Äôs economic growth is expected to face a temporary slowdown too. During such scenarios, exports may find it tough to rise and investments may dry down which would make the target even stiffer.

Opportunities

At the same time, the ongoing US-China trade war can be potentially leveraged as a huge one-time opportunity. Towards the year 1999, the global issue of Y2K migration had presented an opportunity that was seized with both hands by the Indian IT companies. That one-time window of opportunity helped nascent Indian IT companies to grow by leaps and bounds and become global behemoths. The current US-China trade war presents a similar opportunity that could potentially help India‚Äôs Manufacturing sector grow rapidly.



As per USISPF, hundreds of companies are currently looking to relocate their manufacturing base from China. Elon Musk had expressed his desire to start Tesla Manufacturing in India. If Government of India could swiftly come up with policy reforms for companies looking to start manufacturing in India, it could lead to the rapid expansion of India‚Äôs Manufacturing sector with large scale job creation, increased exports and rapid economic growth.

Structural reforms like IBC, GST and others have helped India jump World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 (in 2014) to 63 (in 2019). That‚Äôs a quantum jump signifying a marked improvement in starting new businesses in the country. In another favourable policy change, the government has slashed corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% for existing companies and from 25% to 15% for new manufacturing companies. Including a surcharge and cess, the effective tax rate for existing companies would now come down from 35% to 25.17%. This makes India a highly attractive investment destination for companies looking to set up manufacturing.

In a continued slew of reforms, the government may also announce a dedicated relationship manager for any entity investing more than $500 million in India. Such an officer would help the investor with all government clearances at the centre and state levels.

The Road Ahead

The above steps show the government‚Äôs intent to fuel economic growth. However, while the above are necessary, they may not be sufficient by themselves. As the above analysis illustrates, an aggressive increase in exports is not only the key to boost economic growth but would also strengthen INR to propel the nominal GDP even higher.



For the last few years, India‚Äôs exports have stayed stagnant. Recently, a government panel has reported that an Exports growth rate of 10% is achievable. It requires India to reduce the cost of capital and introduce labour reforms that facilitate easier business expansion. Making labour laws more flexible would enable firms, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, to scale up rapidly. This would create more jobs in the MSME sector which is traditionally the backbone of the Indian economy for sustainable growth, employment generation, development of entrepreneurial skills and contribution to export earnings.

Another recommendation to increase exports is through a renewed focus on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). In that direction, it might be worthwhile to consider that by early November 2019, India may sign up RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) deal. RCEP is a Free Trade Agreement between ten ASEAN countries along with six additional members that include India, China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. In the currently proposed form, RCEP would be the world‚Äôs largest economic bloc, covering nearly half of the global economy.

Read: All you wanted to know about the RCEP, the trade deal forming the world‚Äôs largest economic block

RCEP requires member countries to provide duty-free access to their markets to each other. This makes RCEP a double-edged sword. While some trade organizations in India fear that this might help Chinese goods to flood Indian markets, the treaty also has its benefits for Indian exports. For agricultural products like rice, India has a competitive advantage and RCEP would open up ASEAN countries as a new 10 million tonne market for India. The treaty would also enable Indian industry to join global supply chains for high-end goods such as electronics and engineering.

Additionally, the government is also pursuing a limited trade deal with the USA to reinstate GSP (Generalized System of Preference) for India. GSP is the largest US trade preference programme and is designed to promote economic development by allowing duty-free entry for thousands of products from designated beneficiary countries.

If India signs up RCEP and the limited trade deal with the USA, then it might provide a significant opportunity to increase exports in the coming years. It would also compel Indian manufacturers to create globally competitive products for local consumption and exports, lest they lose out to cheaper imports from China, Vietnam and South Korea.

Summary

The key to hitting the $5 trillion mark is increasing exports, reducing the cost of capital and bringing flexible labour laws. While the government has taken some steps in the above direction, more action on economic reforms is still required.

Eventually, whether India‚Äôs nominal GDP reaches $5 trillion by 2024 or is stuck at below $4.7 trillion is dependent on how the various global factors play out and how the Government of India rolls out economic reforms to propel the economy.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/11/prime-minister-narendra-modi-dollar-5-trillion-economy-by-2024-how-realistic/,

CM Kamal Nath had submitted a written reply to the question, saying that the government has no plans to give an allowance. He added that through the implementation of various state and central schemes, the government is trying to provide skill training to the youth so they can be employed in the private sector.

Previously, leader of the opposition Gopal Bhargav had stated that the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh had cheated the youth of the state by not keeping its election promise. He added that the state budget has made no mention of any kind of unemployment allowance, only clever wordplay.

Bhargav also pointed out that instead of publicising the branding of Mava Bati, Jalebi, and Chiraunji Barfi, the state government should take concrete steps to fulfil the promises on which they sought votes from the people.

While campaigning in the state for the assembly elections, then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had announced last year that the unemployed youth in the state will be provided with an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month. The Kamal Nath government has made no progress to fulfil that claim either.

It is notable here that the Kamal Nath government had earlier announced a ‚ÄòYuva Swabhiman Yojna‚Äô for giving allowance to the unemployed youth in the state. The Madya Pradesh cabinet had also approved the proposal.

In February this year, the Kamal Nath government had announced that the young men and women in urban areas will receive an amount of Rs 4000 per month and under another plan, they will be provided work for a minimum of 100 days.

InfoEdge India CMO Sumeet Singh said, ‚ÄúThe JobSpeak index continues with its positive growth in hiring with a 12 percent rise when compared to the same period last year. Our latest hiring outlook survey showed 89 percent recruiters from the IT industry stating that new jobs and replacement hiring will play a strong role in hiring. Hopefully, the momentum will be sustained in the coming months.‚Äù

The Naukri JobSpeak is a monthly Index which calculates and records hiring activity based on the job listings on Naukri.com website month on month.

Further, the report revealed that the demand for mid-level executives, in the experienced band of 4-7 years, grew by 14 percent whereas recruitment for entry-level jobs, with an experienced band of 0-3 years, witnessed a rise of 12 percent.

Naukri.com, one of India‚Äôs premier job portals, had also published the findings of its Hiring Outlook survey which depicted a very bright scenario for employment opportunities in the country between January to June 2019.

Earlier too, despite much brouhaha created by the Congress over job creation, multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year.

In fact, it was also disclosed lately that CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey and which was instrumental in fear-mongering about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô has a long and interesting history as it is wholly owned by Mr. Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/04/the-it-industry-shows-a-38-rise-in-job-creation-since-last-year-report/,
"Parle responds to reports of 10,000 potential job losses, says no job loss yet, definite slowdown but issue blown out of proportion","In an interview with the media outlet BTVi, senior category head at Parle Products, Mayank Shah clarified that there have been no job losses at Parle yet and that the issue has been blown out of proportion by naysayers. There were reports recently that slowdown could force ParleG to lay off 10,000 staff members.

Shah added that there has been a marked decline in the sales of their products, attributing the slumping sales to the GST tax slab for biscuits below Rs 100 per kg, which attracts 18% GST.

‚ÄúBiscuit as an industry or category has been severely affected. This phenomenon is industry-wide and not Parle specific. The consumer is thinking twice before buying biscuits now. Biscuits which were earlier exempted from excise were now included after the advent of the GST. This has had a serious effect on the sales of the basic biscuits which are less than Rs 100 per Kg. Right now, basic biscuits fall under the same 18 per cent GST slab as the premium biscuits,‚Äù Shah said.

Shah further stated that their company has been requesting the government from last 1 year to look into the matter. ‚ÄúPremium segment biscuits which are sold at or above Rs 100 per kg and basic biscuits which are less than Rs 100 per Kg are two different categories. We have been requesting the government to provide concessions to us in basic biscuits category by changing its GST slab as it did with apparels, footwear and other commodities,‚Äù Shah said.

Dismissing the reports of downsizing at Parle Products, Shah said that the job losses will be an eventuality if the sales of the basic biscuits category continue to decline. Once the category which used to grow at 10-12 per cent per annum is currently declined by 7-8 per cent.

‚ÄúSales of premium biscuits at Parle are showing impressive growth. However, the sales of the basic biscuits category which is for the consumption of common man is getting the beating after the implementation of GST. We have to take a price hike because of the GST.

"Around 15 million jobs created by the Modi govt per year, but the ‚Äòliberal‚Äô propaganda won‚Äôt stop","One of the best articles I read last week was by Dr Surjit S. Bhalla which provided an explanation behind the rise of the use of fake news and fake analysis. The article linked the rise of fake news and of questioning the data on the economy to the record performance of Congress in 2014 as it managed to get its lowest ever tally in its history. The article got me thinking and eventually, I realized that I agree with this conclusion as there has been a lot of unnecessary politicization of a lot of things post 2014 by the opposition.

Ironically, a lot of the new-age media platforms and self-claimed fact checkers have also frequently peddled fake-news that has been then cited by opposition leaders to corner the Modi Government. It takes time to debunk fake-news and the opposition has constructively used this fact to its advantage as it tried to set its own narrative. This article focuses on the issue of jobs as we try to understand the reality of employment creation. At the onset, I must state that I had indicated way back on 22nd May 2018 that missing data on jobs will play a critical role in the 2019 elections. I had also stated in the same article how the issue is not the lack of jobs but the lack of data on jobs.

The issue around PLFS and CMIE

At the onset, I must emphasize that the government should release the Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) to ensure that there is at least some data that can be objectively analyzed by individual researchers. Chances are that PLFS may have findings that may not be consistent with other indicators of job creation in the economy- if that‚Äôs the case then they should make the report public to identify potential flaws in the survey so that it could be improved in future.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

On PLFS being used and compared with the previous employment and unemployment survey, Mr Kant has rightfully put how they both can‚Äôt be compared due to the differences in sampling techniques. So, all the exclusive headlines by ‚Äúeminent journalists‚Äù are just headlines that are devoid of any substance and are only serving the interest of those who benefit from such fraudulent analysis as they mislead their readers and construct a false narrative.

A bulk of the criticism on the lack of jobs from the opposition has come with the start of CMIE‚Äôs data on jobs [OpIndia has already expressed concerns regarding the reliability of CMIE‚Äôs data and you can read that article by clicking here]. While the sample size of most labour force surveys in India has been historically small, the important aspect is whether CMIE is drawing its sample without any skewness in its sampling technique. Mohandas Pai and Yash Baid make a compelling argument against the use of thin surveys as against verifiable and robust data sets such as EPFO, NPS and PPF.

The true picture of jobs

Now the key question in front of us is the true reality of the labour market over the last five years. I refrained from writing it extensively because there was relatively less data points that were available a couple of months ago [an old blog on this issue can be accessed by clicking here], but now, with multiple data points available we can finally make sound conclusions regarding the situation of job creation in the economy.

Dr Bhalla and Dr Das have arrived at an approximate estimate of 8.7 million annual jobs being added by the government. This is based on the estimate of total employment of 448 million in the year 2017/18. Their estimate seems robust and it is likely to be closer to the true scenario of job creation in the economy.

More that arriving at an exact estimate, let us try to establish the situation of jobs. As evident, Dr Bhalla and Dr Das have provided an estimate that shows the positive situation of jobs. It is also important to highlight that these estimates use the EPFO and NPS data both of which also show a positive trend in the job‚Äôs growth post demonetization. EPFO data has improved over subsequent months. In fact, 72.32 lakh new subscribers were added to social security schemes of the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) from September 2017 to December 2018 as formal sector jobs touch 16-month high at 7.16 lakh in December. This further indicates that there‚Äôs a positive change in the data so there must be robust job creation within the economy.

A criticism of the use of EPFO is that it tends to represent more formalization of jobs rather than fresh creation of jobs, but those who criticize the EPFO dataset on these grounds also believe that demonetization didn‚Äôt lead to improved tax compliance and more formalization so clearly, their argument is incoherent. Indeed, EPFO data represents a formal sector of jobs and it is likely that some informal jobs may be becoming formal but the robust jobs growth in the 18-21 age group suggests that there must be a high proportion of the EPFO subscribers who are first-time employees. The latest numbers from EPFO suggests that for the categories of sub-18, 18-21 and 22-25 age groups, there has been an addition of 4 million jobs and a bulk of these must be first-time employees. These jobs are formal jobs that come with all social security benefits, so there is a robust creation of good and decent jobs in the economy.

Another source of job creation comes from Mohandas Pai and Yash Baid‚Äôs analysis using the data for automobile sector where they found that the sector created 3.4 million jobs in FY18, with a further 2.8 million jobs created in the 9 months ended December 31, 2018. The automobile sector tends to grow only when there is robust demand for automobiles which is again a very healthy sign for the growth of the Indian economy. This robust demand further indicates that the labour market continues to be robust.

Moving on to another indicator, an Aon Hewitt survey indicates that the average salary hike in 2018 is 9.4%. If indeed the labour market would have witnessed massive layoffs and unemployment was at an all-time high, then clearly labour supply would have gone up which would have suppressed incomes. The argument of hysteresis as advocated by some is not valid here as labour supply would have invariably gone up because the unemployment if at all was high (which it wasn‚Äôt), it wasn‚Äôt high for a prolonged period. Additionally, India has witnessed very moderate inflation for this period so even the real salary hike on an average is robust and positive. Thus, clearly, there must be jobs in the economy which is why companies are keen on retaining their talent.

Leading HR platforms such as Naukri.com also produces its index to measure the employment situation in the country. According to their report, there was a 3 per cent addition in hiring by companies in March 2018 compared to March 2017. Yet again, we find their findings to be consistent with other indicators of job creation in the economy. In the digital space, there are estimates that suggest that the start-up and digital economy added 3.9 million jobs between 2014-18. This means 0.975 million jobs annually.

Recently, even the CII came out with its own numbers for the MSME sector which tends to employ a significant proportion of India‚Äôs non-agriculture labour force. According to their report, MSMEs created 14% more jobs in the last four years. This is consistent with the acceleration in growth rates of the GDP that the Indian economy has witnessed over the last couple of years along with the revival of the investment cycle in the economy. The report estimates a total of 13.5-14.9 million job additions per annum. These estimates are again indicative of robust job creation in the economy over the last five years.

While there are ample jobs that are being created in the economy across different sectors, a key area of concern that remains is regarding the skills of those who are entering the labour force. While the government has ensured that there is ample labour demand, what needs to be done now is to ensure that there is a significant push towards augmentation of labour supply through successive skilling and reskilling endeavours. Some amount of policy push has already been given towards skill development and perhaps, in subsequent years we will witness a far more robust and dynamic labour market in India than ever before.

Now that we have multiple sources of jobs, it is important to look at all these sources before we conclude the state of employment in the country. It is evident that apart from CMIE, which is a true sense of outlier for reasons best known to them, all other sources categorically demonstrate that there is robust job creation in the economy. This doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise as the government has ramped up public infrastructure projects which have a significant multiplier effect in terms of job creation in the economy. Through these multiple sources of data, we can safely establish that in terms of job creation the last five years have been exceptionally been good and any further debate around jobs would be driven by political considerations rather than all available empirical evidence.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/03/around-15-million-jobs-created-by-the-modi-govt-per-year-but-the-liberal-propaganda-wont-stop/,
"With the Jaipur rally, Rahul Gandhi, and his gaffes, are back","Amidst the recent formulated ‚Äòprotests‚Äô over CAA, NRC and NPR tension brewing in the country, Rahul Gandhi is back to provide his fans with some comic relief, bringing laughter and joy into the long series of incessant lies and baseless accusations, most of which, interestingly, also come from himself.

The senior Congress leader was in Jaipur, Rajasthan on January 28 to launch a ‚Äòserious‚Äô campaign to tap so-called ‚Äòyouth anger‚Äô against the central government in wake of CAA and NRC and the so-called highhandedness in dealing with student protests in university campuses particularly in JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia and AMU.

Addressing the youth of the country at the ‚ÄòAkrosh Rally‚Äô in Jaipur, Rajasthan, the prince of goof-ups, merely 2.04 minutes into his power-packed speech, said: ‚ÄúHindustan ka yuva berojgaari ke sapne dekhta hai‚Äù roughly translated as ‚ÄúThe youth of the country dreams of unemployment‚Äù, while inadvertently also admitting that the Modi government is breaking the dreams of the youth.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

People are left to wonder here whether he actually intended to speak against the Modi government or in their favour?

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY5M3jKUwtU]

Rahul Gandhi, in the beginning of his speech, with all conviction, asserted: ‚ÄúHindustan ya yuva sirf Hindustan nahin desh badal sakta hai‚Äù (India‚Äôs youth can not only change India but also the country). Here, ‚ÄòIndia‚Äô and the ‚Äòcountry‚Äô would have technically meant the same thing.

Though the Congress leader quickly corrected himself at this point by replacing ‚Äòdesh‚Äô (country) with ‚Äòduniya‚Äô (world), which actually made some sense, he did not think it important to rectify his ‚ÄúHindustan ka yuva berojgaari ke sapne dekhta hain‚Äù gaffe.

The list of gaffes committed by Rahul Gandhi is endless. Addressing an election rally in Jharkhand, last December, the Gandhi scion conjured up a new mathematical numeral-‚ÄòDhai Hazaar Panch Sau‚Äô ( Rs 2500 500). It is interesting to note that initially he had said the correct figure, two thousand five hundred, but being himself, he invented the new number just a moment later.

Read: Rahul Gandhi: Mad(e) in India

This is not the first time that the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has regaled his audience and listeners with his unintended humour. Last year, Rahul Gandhi invented another numeral-‚Äúpichatees‚Äù while slamming the BJP government for the rising unemployment figures.

The list of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs problems with numbers is endless. During the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaigns, the then Congress president had given different numbers about their promised NYAY scheme at different rallies. Although the proposal had promised ‚Çπ72,000 per year, Rahul Gandhi had promised ‚Çπ72,000 per month in one place, while had promised a whopping ‚Çπ72,000 crore per year in another place.

However, a deeper analysis shows that this perception of poor job creation under NDA tenure may be false.

Concerns of poor job data by former NITI Aayog chief

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Former NITI Aayog chief Arvind Panagariya had remarked that job data in India is not accurate in an interview to Hindustan Times. This is because the labour bureau data on jobs, which is collected every three months covers only those firms which have more than 10 employees. Jobs created in informal sector are not covered. He also said that a more accurate source for job data , the NSSO household survey (Employment and Unemployment Survey) ,is collected once in five years. This makes it difficult for the government to assess real numbers of jobs created or lost in the economy.

Existing surveys to measure employment are misleading

In a study titled ‚ÄòTowards a Payroll Reporting in India‚Äô, conducted by Pulak Ghosh (Professor IIM, Bangalore) and Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, (Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI) have tried to address the poor jobs data scenario in India‚Äôs formal sector. They call the existing surveys to measure employment as ‚Äòmost misleading‚Äô in their report. The reasons cited for this remark are (emphasis added) :

Information was sought from around 11,179 units as a representative sample for 8 sectors at all India level.

Number of non-respondent not disclosed in the Survey

The survey result comes with a huge lag. In the Dec‚Äô17 month Labour Bureau has published employment situation as of Mar‚Äô17

This is primarily an establishment survey for collecting information on employment in the unit; therefore, it does not provide any information on unemployment in the country

The survey is based on either record or response of the unit. However, verification of record has not been resorted to for collection of data

The Collection of Statistics Act-2008, is not applied to QES. Hence, all the information provided by the selected unit/ establishment is on a voluntary basis

The Scope of QES is limited to all establishments having 10 or more workers and the scope & coverage is further limited to employment in Non-farm Industrial economy covering 8 selected sectors (vis-√†-vis universe of 190 industries)

A better method for collecting employment data

The researchers have studied payroll data generated for new employees ( in the age group of 18 to 25) in formal sector for the financial year 2017-18. They have got the raw data for the study from ESIC (Employees‚Äô State Insurance Corporation), NPS (National Pension Scheme) and GPF (Government Provident Fund) to understand the real scenario of jobs in the country. The main findings of their study is captured in two graphs.

Graph 1

Graph 1 is a compilation of the total number of payrolls generated for new employees in the age group of 18-25. This is more reliable than the labour bureau data as there is a confirmation of the employee numbers because of the social security payment records for the entire workforce in formal sector.

Graph 2

Graph 2 captures the data of EPFO (till November ‚Äô17 ) ESIC (till September ‚Äô17 ) NPS (till October‚Äô17). It finds out the number of new employees on the payroll tIll the end of these months and estimates the number of jobs that may be added to the economy by the end of fiscal year.

7 million new jobs in 2017-18 is a conservative estimate

While commenting on these two graphs researchers say that the study is the first such study on payroll situation in India. They also remark that it is a conservative estimate and inclusion of data from other professional bodies could show a higher number of jobs in the economy. They suggest that the job scenario could be properly understood if EPFO, ESIC & NPS in collaboration publish a monthly report of new payrolls in India . They suggest big data analyses to capture payrolls generated in informal sector as well.

Thus the myth of poor job creation under the Narendra Modi government could turn out to be false. If a similar study is done for previous fiscals, the number of jobs generated so far under the NDA government might end up higher than those posted by the labour bureau data. A better method for capturing job data needs to be set up by the government to capture the scenario at ground level to debunk false perceptions created by the media and opposition",https://www.opindia.com/2018/01/study-by-iim-b-professor-debunks-claims-of-jobless-growth/,
"76.48 lakh jobs created in last 17 months, 8.96 lakh jobs in January alone: EFPO payroll data","According to the latest payroll data released by the Employment Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), the net employment generation in the formal sector shot up to a 17-month high reaching 8.96 lakh jobs in the month of January. The EPFO has been releasing the payroll data since April 2018 covering the period starting September 2017. The number of EPFO subscribers was 131 per cent high in January 2019 as compared to January 2018 when only 3.87 lakh EPFO subscribers were added.

According to the data, a total of 2,75,609 jobs were created in September 2017 and about 76.48 lakh new subscribers were added to social security schemes of the EPFO between September 2017 to January 2019. The payroll data had witnessed a slight decline (1.8%) in December 2018 stopping at 7.03 lakh as compared to the estimate of 7.16 lakh released the previous month. For the period between September 2017-December 2018, the EPFO revised the cumulative job addition data downwards 6.6 percent to 67.52 lakh as against the forecast of 72.32 lakh.

Being the closing month of the financial year, March 2018 experienced the sharpest decline with 29,023 members exiting the EPFO subscription contrary to last month‚Äôs estimated addition of 5,498 members. During January 2019, the highest number of jobs were created in the 22-25 year age group which was 2.44 lakh jobs. This was followed by 2.24 lakh jobs in the 18-21 year age bracket.

"MSME sector created around 1.5 crore jobs each year in last 4 years, CII finds in its latest survey","Amid all the claims of jobless growth during the term of Modi government, a survey conducted by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has found an increase of 13.9% in net job creations in the MSME sector over the last four years. In the largest ever survey specific to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, over one lakh firms of various sizes were included across various sectors and geographies.

CII is India‚Äôs premier business organisation, it is a non-government, not-for-profit, industry-led and industry-managed body. It has over 9,000 members, and indirect membership of over 3,00,000 enterprises through around 265 national and regional sectoral industry bodies.

‚ÄúThe survey establishes a growth of 3.3 per cent (compounded growth rate) per annum. When mapped to the macro level data sourced from Labour Bureau, this works out to an estimated additional job creation to the tune of 13.5 to 14.9 million per annum‚Äù, said Mr Rakesh Bharti Mittal, President of CII. The total strength of labour forces is estimated at about 45 crore in the year 2017-18 using data from labour bureau.

According to the survey, Hospitality & Tourism was the top job generating sector, followed by Textiles & Apparel, Metal Products, Machinery Parts and Transport & Logistic. ‚ÄúThe survey also reveals that the Micro enterprises were the largest job creators in the past four years and will continue to be so in the next three years‚Äù CII Director General Mr Chandrajit Banerjee said.

The survey indicates the higher growth on employment generation will continue for next two-three years. It is expected that government initiatives like the 2 per cent interest rate subvention given to all MSMEs and Trade Receivable e-Discounting System (TReDS) implemented recently would drive future growth leading to more employment. ‚ÄúHowever, the CII survey highlights the need for greater hand-holding of the MSMEs who are still to take full advantage of these Government initiatives,‚Äù said Mr Banerjee.

The survey by CII shows that a majority of enterprises were able to fill vacancies under a month, indicating higher availability of skilled manpower. ‚ÄúThe survey has indeed thrown up the most promising outcomes. There is a very healthy growth in employment among the MSME segment of industry and with the kind of disruptions and innovations that are likely to sweep through industry in terms of new technologies and practices, our skills development front is also undergoing rapid changes,‚Äù said the CII President.

"CMIE, that has ties to P Chidambaram and fear-mongered about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô was a part of Congress Manifesto Committee","The Congress party released its 2019 Lok Sabha Election Manifesto with much fanfare on Tuesday, the 2nd of April 2019. The manifesto had several rather dangerous aspects to it. Apart from accusing the Indian Army of sexual violence and torture in Kashmir, the Congress promised to dilute AFSPA, curtail the power of the Media and make the NSA accountable to all politicians, thereby running the risk of making public sensitive national security concerns.

Heading the Manifesto committee was senior Congress leader P Chidambaram. Interestingly, according to a report in the Times of India, the following were the ‚Äúpolicy wonks‚Äù who helped formulate the Congress manifesto.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

An interesting name that is included in the list, is that of Mr Mahesh Vyas, CEO of CMIE. Multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year. However, CMIE decided to present shoddy data to claim that unemployment was at its highest.

Interestingly, the CEO is CMIE, it has now been revealed, was helping Congress build their manifesto.

CMIE has a long and interesting history and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram who was the head of the Manifesto committee in which Mahesh Vyas was also involved.

CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey, is wholly owned by Mr Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam.

Mr Shah has been accused of accessing data from NSE on a preferential basis in connivance with the authorities and sharing this data with certain stockbrokers for use in High-Frequency Trading. The scam is being investigated by SEBI, CBI as well as by Income Tax authorities.

The current MD of CMIE is Mr Mahesh Vyas, who happens to be the brother-in-law of Mr Ajay Shah. The timing of the commencement of this Job Survey raises suspicion on the motivation as well as the credibility of the data. The co-location scam came to public light in late 2015, and the first Job Survey was out in April 2016.

Several of the news articles (as well as Wikipedia entry on NSE Co-location scam at the time of writing this article) mentions that Mr Ajay Shah is a very close confidante of Mr P. Chidambaram. Given this information and the ownership pattern of CMIE, any ‚ÄòJob Survey‚Äô from CMIE should be taken with a pinch (or a tonne) of salt, as one would take it from a Congress IT cell.

The entire story of the close association between CMIE and P Chidambaram and also the improprieties attached its key players can be read here.

The information at hand begs a few important questions:

1. Since the owners of CMIE are accused of impropriety, was it appropriate to get Mahesh Vyas involved in the Manifesto committee?

2. That Mahesh Vyas and CMIE are connected to P Chidambaram is a known fact. Vyas‚Äô involvement in the Manifesto committee has only reinforced it. Was the CMIE data that was milked by the Congress party reliable and uninfluenced by this association?",https://www.opindia.com/2019/04/cmie-that-has-ties-to-p-chidambaram-and-fear-mongered-about-unemployment-in-india-was-a-part-of-congress-manifesto-committee/,
SC judgments led to job loss of 23 lakh people in the mining sector: FIMI,"After senior jurist Harish Salve held Supreme Court responsible for the current economic slowdown of the country, the Federation of Indian Mining Industries (FIMI) on Monday has echoed the same sentiments stating that some judgments of the Apex Court have led to around job loss for 23 lakh people, both direct and indirect, in the mining sector, excluding petroleum and natural gas.

Reportedly, RK Sharma, secretary-general of FIMI said, in 2011-12 the mining sector employed 23.23 lakh people and due to various judgments, including bans and restrictions on mining placed by the Supreme Court, there was a significant drop in employment in the mining sector.

Sharma further added that due to bans and restrictions imposed by the court, around 80,000 direct employee lost their jobs in Karnataka. According to him, the number of job losses due to SC intervention was higher in Goa numbering nearly one lakh. Addition to that, the huge penalties imposed by the apex court in 2017 on 102 iron and manganese ore leases in Odisha has also led to around 50,000 direct job loss.

On the pretext of illegal mining, in 2011, the Supreme Court had banned mining in 188 leases in Karnataka. Subsequently, it allowed mining in 115 leases. However, in 2012, the Supreme Court had suspended all mining leases in Goa, but in 2014 granted renewals of leases with an annual production cap of 20 million tonnes. However, with effect from March last year, it cancelled the renewal of 88 mining, putting a blanket ban on the mining operation in the state.

‚ÄúThe closure or limitation of production has crippled the mining industry and adversely impacted both direct and indirect employment. Many mines are finding it difficult to operate and closing down one by one, further creating a slump and increasing the unemployment rate in remote and tribal regions,‚Äù Sharma added.

The mining sector is the third-largest in terms of generating job per unit increase in the sectoral GDP with an employment elasticity of 0.52%, next only to construction and finance & real estate. This implies that for every 1% growth in the mining sector‚Äôs GDP, employment in the sector increases by 0.52%.

Reportedly, nearly 2,60,000 people are in danger of job loss, direct and indirect, because of the lapsing of merchant mines by March next year. The validity 329 mining leases will end by March 31, causing job losses for 2,64,000. On the list of the lapsing mines are 48 operative leases, whose shutdown will lead to a deficit of around 60 million tonnes (mt) in raw material suppliers, mainly iron ore.

Recently, distinguished lawyer Harish Salve had also blamed the Supreme Court of India for the economic slowdown the country is currently experiencing. In an interview, Salve held the apex court responsible for the slump in the economy stating that the slowdown was triggered by the court‚Äôs verdict in the 2G spectrum case in 2012.

Salve had asserted that the top court‚Äôs order on 2G and coal allocation triggered foreign investors to exit from the Indian markets. In 2012, the Supreme Court had invalidated the 122 spectrum licences granted to eight companies. Salve contended that a blanket cancellation of allocation that happened in accordance with the rules set by the then government had a negative impact on the foreign investors who had to bear the brunt of the malfeasance of government authorities.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/09/supreme-court-judgments-have-led-to-23-lakh-job-losses-in-the-mining-sector-says-federation-of-indian-mining-industries/,
Did Congress President Rahul Gandhi just admit that UPA failed to generate jobs?,"Days after advocating ISIS Rojgar Yojana, where he equated ISIS terrorists to ‚Äòpoor unemployed youth‚Äô, he has now upped his game. He has claimed that the reason people like Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump got votes is because people were angry due to unemployment and had much expectations from them. Interacting with Indian Journalists‚Äô Association in London, the Congress President said that people support Modi and Trump because they are ‚Äòangry because they don‚Äôt have a job‚Äô.

For someone who aspires to be Prime Minister of India in 2019, Rahul Gandhi needs a refresher course. For ten years before Modi got elected, the UPA led by Congress, where his mother Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson, was in power. That senior Congress leader Dr. Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister. So essentially, if what he is saying about people voting for Modi and Trump because they are angry due to unemployment, it is probably because UPA failed to generate jobs.

This statement of his came a days after he embarrassed himself on an international platform by admitting his ignorance on Doklam issue, while constantly criticising and questioning the government on the same on all forums.

This is not the first time Congress‚Äô Prime Ministerial candidate has made a self goal. Earlier, in a bid to attack the PM earlier, Gandhi had inadvertently implied that the Nirav Modi-PNB scam was approved by Congress in 2011 when the UPA was in power.

Trying once again to pull PM Narendra Modi for allegedly outpacing BJP veteran leader LK Advani in 2014, Rahul said that the ‚Äúboxer‚Äù Prime Minister was ‚Äúsupposed to fight unemployment, farmer problems, corruption etc but he instead turned around and punched his coach Advani ji in his face, his team Gadkari ji Jaitley ji, then went into crowd and punched small traders and farmers.‚Äù

Interestingly, in his hurry to insult the Prime Minister, Rahul Gandhi ended up admitting to his party‚Äôs mess that was inherited by the Modi government.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

The Congress president‚Äôs flippant attempt to mock Modi sounded more like submission of his own party‚Äôs past shortcoming. What could be understood from Rahul‚Äôs statement is that when PM Modi came to power in 2014, he had to undertake several problems like unemployment, corruption, farmers issues, which were left unattended by the outbound Congress government.

Rahul Gandhi accidentally throws light on the adverse conditions the Congress party had left the country in before Modi picked up the reins in his hands.

This is not the first time Rahul has used this vile jibe to denounce the PM. Earlier too, while addressing a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi attacked PM Modi making a veiled reference to allotting of the Gandhinagar seat, which traditionally belonged to senior BJP leader L K Advani, to BJP President Amit Shah for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Rahul Gandhi said that Narendra Modi hit senior BJP leader L K Advani with shoes and pushed him off the stage.

If this was not disgraceful enough, Rahul was seen repeating the same disgraceful remark the very next day in his Hardiwar rally on April 6.

To put things in perspective, L K Advani, born on November 8, 1927, is 91 years old. In the last five years, he has hardly been involved in active politics. It is only natural for people to retire after decades of active public life and make way for newer faces and leaders.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/05/watch-rahul-gandhi-admits-that-congress-rule-produced-unemployment-corruption-problems-for-farmers-etc/,
"Under the Modi government, Northeast India has witnessed many ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô","‚ÄúWe are committed to making the Northeast an engine of India‚Äôs growth story‚Äù: PM Modi.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while inaugurating the first-ever airport of Sikkim in Pakyong on 24th September reiterated his commitment towards the development of Northeast India. Modi has maintained that ‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs growth story will get speed only when there is an all-round development of the Northeast and its people‚Äô.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

While addressing the people of Sikkim, PM Modi stated that with Sikkim getting its first ever airport, India has managed to get 1000 airports operational out of which 35 airports can be attributed to the BJP government since they have been developed in the last 4 years.

BJP until the recent victory in state elections in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya which was a landmark for the party, had very little traction in the region except in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The party was even seen as an outsider until PM Modi‚Äôs ‚ÄòAct East‚Äô policy changed the situation.

As part of this policy, the NDA government has been focusing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all-around connectivity through road, rail, telecom, power and waterways sectors.

This year, as a part of the government‚Äôs vision, to see Northeast India on top of the development chart, solar toilets were installed at Ibudhou Marjing hill Heingang of Manipur, making Manipur the first state in North-East and third in India to have solar toilets.

Last year while addressing a meeting after inaugurating a 60-MW Tuirial hydropower project, Modi had announced that Mizoram had become the third power-surplus state in the North-East after Sikkim and Tripura. Modi had then proudly said ‚ÄúThe completion of this project is a reflection of our commitment to completing ongoing projects and ushering in a new era of development in the North-East.

The Tuirial project, which was announced and cleared in 1998 by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was the first major central project to be successfully commissioned in Mizoram.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year also inaugurated India‚Äôs longest bridge, the Dhola-Sadia bridge, spanning 9.3 km across the Brahmaputra, taking infrastructure development in the region forward by several steps.

The road bridge, connecting Dhola in Arunachal Pradesh to Sadiya in Assam, has been built at a cost of Rs2,056 crore by the ministry of road transport and highways.

PM Narendra Modi had in 2016 inaugurated a petrochemical project in Dibrugarh in Assam, a first-ever such project in the northeast. The project is India‚Äôs highest wax producing unit using indigenous technology.

In its quest to intensify the development of Northeastern regions, the government currently is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight North Eastern states at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.

Under the supervision of Modi government, railways have undertaken a major expansion in the region at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore. In November 2014, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya were put up on the railway map for the first time. Agartala in Tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line.

In the North East, the Indian Railways has commissioned about 900 kilometres of Broad Gauge in the last two years and in addition to this 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to North East (that is New Maynaguri ‚Äì Jogighopa) has also been commissioned. The Indian Railways had announced in May that it plans to invest a further Rs 40,000 crores in the Northeastern states for infrastructure development and connectivity.

Modi government concerned about the staggering unemployment rate encompassing Northeast regions have established two important projects in Assam ‚Äì Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and Numaligarh Refinery Limited‚Äôs wax unit, which would create huge job opportunities for people in the northeast.

In its first, the Modi government implemented an improved internet connectivity project for the North East region in collaboration with Bangladesh, which will make 10 GB of seamless alternate bandwidth available for the region.

Connectivity, economic growth, tourism and enabling the locals to find better opportunities in employment has been the focus of the government. In August this year, the NDA government passed the bill for India‚Äôs first ever sports university to be built in Manipur.

Apart from these developments, the government believing and working towards achieving PMs vision making ‚ÄòNortheast an engine of India‚Äôs growth story‚Äô, has been relentlessly working in other spheres as well which includes Tourism, Development of rural areas, setting up of BPO industry, organic farming etc.

Recently in the fourth summit of BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) which was held at Nepal capital Kathmandu on 30th and 31th August 2018, Prime Minister, re-emphasised the importance to Northeastern India and stressed on his priority to develop the region.",https://www.opindia.com/2018/09/under-the-modi-government-northeast-india-has-witnessed-many-firsts/,
The IT-industry shows a 38% rise in job creation since last year: Report,"According to latest reports, the IT industry has shown continuous growth in the recruitment landscape over the past six months, recording a rise of 38 percent growth surpassing the 12 percent national average hike in hirings on a year-on-year basis from March 2018, says Naukri JobSpeak report.

The Naukri JobSpeak Index for March 2019, stood at 2,378, which is 12 percent higher in hiring activities from March 2018, which stood at 2,129. Also among all the major metro cities, Bangaluru topped the list, as it contributed 18 percent of the total recruitments.

The report reveals that industries such as IT Software, IT Hardware, BPO/ITES, FMCG have witnessed an increase in hirings in March 2019 compared to March 2018. While the IT-industry has been recording an increase from 32 percent to 38 percent, Construction and Engineering saw an increase of 13 percent, BPO/ITES by 9 percent, FMCG by 5 percent, Education by 7 percent and IT-Hardware by 3 percent.

InfoEdge India CMO Sumeet Singh said, ‚ÄúThe JobSpeak index continues with its positive growth in hiring with a 12 percent rise when compared to the same period last year. Our latest hiring outlook survey showed 89 percent recruiters from the IT industry stating that new jobs and replacement hiring will play a strong role in hiring. Hopefully, the momentum will be sustained in the coming months.‚Äù

The Naukri JobSpeak is a monthly Index which calculates and records hiring activity based on the job listings on Naukri.com website month on month.

Further, the report revealed that the demand for mid-level executives, in the experienced band of 4-7 years, grew by 14 percent whereas recruitment for entry-level jobs, with an experienced band of 0-3 years, witnessed a rise of 12 percent.

Naukri.com, one of India‚Äôs premier job portals, had also published the findings of its Hiring Outlook survey which depicted a very bright scenario for employment opportunities in the country between January to June 2019.

Earlier too, despite much brouhaha created by the Congress over job creation, multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year.

In fact, it was also disclosed lately that CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey and which was instrumental in fear-mongering about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô has a long and interesting history as it is wholly owned by Mr. Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram.",http://www.opindia.com/2019/04/the-it-industry-shows-a-38-rise-in-job-creation-since-last-year-report/,

While there is nothing factually wrong in these reports, the real mischief lies in what these reports don‚Äôt tell you.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

What the reports don‚Äôt clarify:

The increase in debt is perfectly normal, in fact, India is doing better than many major economies on this parameter

The central government borrows money (from internal and external sources) to fund the fiscal deficit. Govt debt is nothing but an accumulation of fiscal deficits over the years. Government debt over the years has always increased. The important factor here is the sustainability of the debt, and the most important parameter to evaluate sustainability is the Debt to GDP ratio (because as the GDP increases, govt‚Äôs revenue increases and thus its ability to service debt enhances). In India‚Äôs case, the Central government debt to GDP ratio has been hovering around 44-47% since 2010 and has shown improvement under the Modi government.

The above chart shows that the ratio has improved from 46.98% in 2013 to 45.11% in 2017. Similarly, the gross general government debt, which includes borrowings of both Central and State governments has hovered between 67-72% since 2010 and is expected to steadily decline until 2024.

Finance ministry, in a recent press release, commented on the government debt ‚Äì

The overall liabilities of the Central Government are on a medium-term declining trajectory and Government‚Äôs Debt Portfolio is characterised by prudent risk profile. Government is primarily resorting to market-linked borrowings for financing its fiscal deficit. Conventional indicators of Debt sustainability, i.e., Debt/GDP ratio, interest payment to revenue receipts, shares of short-term Debt/External Debt/FRBs in total debt indicate that the debt profile of the Government is comfortably placed in terms of debt sustainability parameters and is consistently improving.

Under UPA, central government debt increased at a much higher rate

While all reports and tweets by opposition leaders harped on the 49% increase in central government debt under Modi government, they conveniently forgot to compare it with what happened during UPA government. OpIndia analysis shows that the central government debt increased by 68% under UPA-I and 89% under UPA-II. Cumulatively, the debt more than tripled in 10 years of UPA. But why show the complete picture when half of it helps your propaganda?

When it comes to external debt (borrowings from foreign governments and institutions), the figure saw an increase of 443% under UPA-I, 60% under UPA-II and 0.04% under the Modi government. This underscores the statement from the Finance Ministry that the government is primarily resorting to market-linked borrowings to finance the fiscal deficit.

Thus, the number 49% is more hype and less substance. But it‚Äôs election season, so expect much more misleading news based on half-truths.",https://www.opindia.com/2019/01/media-spreads-half-truths-about-central-government-debt-under-modi/,

Why are so many women absent from India‚Äôs workforce?,"India‚Äôs rapid economic growth has been accompanied by falling fertility rates and higher educational attainment among women. These advances often lead to an increase in women entering the labour force, but there has been a surprising decline on this front in India. Less than 30 per cent of working-age women are currently in work compared to nearly 80 per cent of men in India.

The conspicuous absence of women in India‚Äôs labour force is part of a wider issue the country is facing when it comes to jobs growth. But the fact that it is affecting women more than men is a worrying trend for India, which tends to rank poorly in UN rankings like the Gender Development Index and Gender Inequality Index, and has historically had low shares of women participating in the labour market. Plus, the number of women working has been gradually falling over the last 30 years.

There are a number of reasons for this, ranging from a lack of jobs growth in female-friendly sectors such as manufacturing, to more women staying in education for longer, and persisting stigma surrounding the idea of women working. As India grapples with boosting the number of jobs available to people ‚Äì and young people especially ‚Äì it must ensure it does not leave women behind in the process.

Global trends

It is useful to understand India‚Äôs experience against the global landscape. According to the latest estimates from the UN‚Äôs International Labour Organisation, the worldwide labour force participation rate in 2018 for women aged 15-64 was 53 per cent while it was 80.6 per cent for similarly aged men. Since 1990, participation rates for both groups have shown an overall decline around the world.

There are, however, variations in these global trends. The number of women working in high income countries went up between 1990 and 2018, largely due to policies like better parental leave, subsidised childcare, and flexibility in jobs. But in South Asia‚Äôs low and middle income countries, the number of women working has declined.

In India, female labour force participation fell from 35 per cent in 1990 to 27 per cent in 2018. India fares better than its neighbour Pakistan (where the rate increased from 14 per cent to 25 per cent over the same period). But it lags behind Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal, and other countries at similar stages of growth and development.

There are regional and demographic differences across the country. Rural women have higher participation rates than their urban counterparts. Married women, less educated women, and women from higher castes are less likely to participate in the labour market.

Reasons for the drop

Both economic and cultural reasons explain women falling out of India‚Äôs labour force. The latest evidence suggests that the number of jobs in India is on the decline. This is a significant structural problem for a country with a burgeoning young population. In particular, India has struggled to create labour-intensive manufacturing jobs, many of which favour women. This is in contrast to countries such as Bangladesh that experienced a booming export-led manufacturing sector that led to more employment opportunities for women.

The number of women staying in education in both urban and rural areas has increased, keeping them out of the workforce for longer. But, even when this is accounted for, the numbers of women working remains below India‚Äôs peers. For men, greater education leads to higher participation in the labour force.

Across India, there are cultural expectations that married women should not work and that they should prioritise housework and care work. A survey on social attitudes in 2016 found that around 40-60 per cent of men and women believe married women should not work if the husband earns reasonably well.

Another factor keeping women out of the workforce is the wider problem of violence against women. New work finds that sexual violence and an unsafe environment for women also stops them seeking paid work outside their homes ‚Äì this is especially the case for Muslim and lower-caste women.

Reversing the decline

Gender equality is an important development objective in and of itself. Research shows that when women work they have greater agency and voice and the poorer representation of women in paid work has negative consequences for their bargaining power within their households. Plus, increasing the number of women in work is important for any country‚Äôs economic growth, leading to better productivity and improving prospects for future generations.

There are a number of ways to boost the number of women working. Tackling the cultural reasons that result in women leaving the workforce could be one such way. Changing social norms about gender equity and women‚Äôs work is paramount, and this is where awareness programmes and affirmative action policies may help alleviate gender stereotypes. The 2017 Maternity Benefit Act, by increasing paid maternity leave, may also help to limit the drop-out of women from work after motherhood. Access to subsidised childcare may also free up time for women to engage in the labour force.

At a more structural level, the next government faces a tough task of reforming the economy to create more jobs. When it does so, it must take into account India‚Äôs growing gender employment gap and specifically think about jobs for women, if it wants to reduce this gap and help boost the country‚Äôs economy.

"India‚Äôs railway network receives 19m applications for 63,000 jobs","India‚Äôs railway network attracted 19 million applications for just 63,000 vacancies as part of a national drive to recruit helpers, porters, cleaners, gatemen, track maintainers and assistant switchmen.

Anil Gujjar, the son of a farmer and the first person in his family to attend university, was one of those who applied for a position.

He arrived in India‚Äôs capital from a small village in the northwestern state of Rajasthan carrying nothing except a backpack and hopes of finding a good job.

At the test centre in Delhi where he took a mandatory exam in November, he looked around warily at hundreds of young men like him. Nearly all were university students or graduates. Some even had master‚Äôs degrees.

The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India‚Äôs employment conundrum. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, but it is not generating enough jobs ‚Äì let alone good jobs ‚Äì for the increasingly educated young people entering the workforce.

By 2021, the number of people in India between the ages of 15 and 34 is expected to reach 480 million. They have higher levels of literacy and are staying in school longer than any previous generation of Indians. The youth surge represents an opportunity for this country of 1.3 billion, economists say, but only if such young people can find productive work.

Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all Indian states between 2011 and 2016. Jobless rates for young people and those with higher education qualifications increased during the same period, in some cases sharply: the unemployment rate for university graduates jumped from 4.1 per cent to 8.4 per cent, according to Santosh Mehrotra, a labour economist.

The fate of India‚Äôs millions of job-seekers represents a major political liability for its prime minister Narendra Modi as he seeks re-election this year. Mr Modi came to power almost five years ago promising ‚Äúdevelopment for all‚Äù and robust job creation.

But his attempts to increase manufacturing and entrepreneurship have not succeeded in turbocharging employment.

Meanwhile, Mr Modi‚Äôs controversial move in late 2016 to invalidate most of India‚Äôs bank notes ‚Äì ostensibly to stem corruption ‚Äì had a deleterious impact on workers. About 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research firm in Mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. Its data also showed that the Indian workforce shrank between 2017 and 2018 ‚Äì not a sign of a healthy job market.

‚ÄúIndia is rapidly losing an opportunity,‚Äù says Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the research firm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just arguing needlessly and endlessly rather than deploying all these young people coming into the labour market into productive work.‚Äù The result, he says, is a ‚Äúslow and insidious crisis‚Äù.

For many young Indian people, finding a job is an all-consuming task. An entire industry has sprung up offering ‚Äúpersonality development‚Äù classes ‚Äì a combination of basic English, social skills and interview preparation advertised as improving employability. Job scams are common, with fraudsters preying on the aspirations of those seeking work.

Educated youths do not want to be ‚Äúpakora wallahs‚Äù ‚Äì people who make a quintessential fried Indian snack ‚Äì according to Radhicka Kapoor, an economist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. ‚ÄúThey want good, productive jobs, and they‚Äôre going to wait it out until they in fact find these jobs.‚Äù

Ajit Ghose, an economist at the Institute for Human Development in Delhi, says that India needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce ‚Äì who number an estimated 6 million to 8 million a year ‚Äì but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that pay a decent wage. Ghose calculates that India has at least 104 million such ‚Äúsurplus‚Äù workers.

That‚Äôs a monumental challenge for any government ‚Äì and one that India‚Äôs leadership is not meeting. Judging the Modi government‚Äôs track record on job creation is complicated by the fact that it has not released any comprehensive nationwide employment data since 2016. The Labour and Statistics ministries have conducted more recent employment surveys of Indian households, but those results have not been made public.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs anybody‚Äôs guess whether we‚Äôll see any employment statistics come out before the 2019 elections,‚Äù says Amit Basole, an economist at Azim Premji University.

Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argues that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry. Meanwhile, he says, his sense is that concerns about job creation are ‚Äúoverblown‚Äù given India‚Äôs high rates of economic growth.

For India‚Äôs educated youths, searching for a job that meets their aspirations can feel like a marathon. At the test centre in Delhi, waves of applicants for the railway positions arrived three times a day, each week day, from September until mid-December ‚Äì a scene replicated at hundreds of exam centres across the country.

The flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. One entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. Since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam centre, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of 50 rupees (around 50p). A vendor sold tube socks and earbuds on the pavement.

The railway jobs on offer ‚Äì sometimes referred to as Group D positions ‚Äì are junior but offer security and a comparatively good salary. The starting pay is 18,000 rupees (¬£200) a month, plus there are perks such as free train travel.

The stories of the young men ‚Äì and they were all men, with one exception, at a test centre in Delhi over two days ‚Äì are striking in their sameness. The applicants are mostly university students and graduates from the northern Indian states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who are seeking a way out of the villages where they grew up. There are no jobs there, they say.

Gujjar arrived in Delhi for the first time in his life the evening before his 9am exam. He spent the night sleeping on a sheet that he spread on the floor of the railway station. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the exam centre, where he stood, waiting, in a thin striped sweater, arms crossed against the pre-dawn chill. At 7.35am, a guard carrying a portable loudspeaker began barking instructions to the assembled test-takers.

Too anxious to chat, Gujjar declines to describe how he felt at that moment. ‚ÄúAsk me after I see the exam paper,‚Äù he says. The posts at Indian Railways held no inherent appeal, he explains. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not about interest,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI just want a job‚Äù.

Gujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. A year ago, he tried to join the Indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. There are no opportunities in his village in the district of Jhunjhunu, he says, and most of his friends do not have steady work.

After taking the 90-minute computerised test, Gujjar strides through a blue metal gate with a smile of relief on his face. The exam was not as difficult as he had feared. It will be months before he knows whether he has beaten the odds, which are roughly one in 300. ‚ÄúIf I get a job, it will be worth it,‚Äù he says.

India to introduce minimum wage for millions of workers,"Millions of low-paid domestic workers employed in India under zero-hours contracts are to be paid a minimum wage, under plans set out by the country's labour ministry.

The draft proposal guarantees domestic workers access to social security benefits, including maternity leave, pensions and health insurance, and offers protection from abuse.

Domestic workers, around 80 per cent of whom are women, are employed by wealthier Indians to perform household chores, with low pay and little or no job security.

Many come from poor, rural parts of the country, are illiterate and innumerate, and live apart from their families - leaving them particularly vulnerable to abuse.

Announcing the plan, India‚Äôs labour ministry said it would ‚Äúexplicitly and effectively expand the scope of applicable legislations, policies and schemes to grant domestic workers rights that are enshrined in laws‚Äù.

‚ÄúMinistry of labour and employment is considering to formulate a national policy for domestic workers under which part-time, full-time and live-in workers, employers, private placement agencies will be clearly defined,‚Äù it added.

‚ÄúThe policy aims to promote right to fair terms of employment relating to minimum wages, protection from abuse/harassment and violence, access to social security benefits such as health insurance, maternity benefits and old age pensions.‚Äù

But critics say the wording of the proposal is too vague, and it fails to set out a timeline or details on pay or benefits.

Campaigners have long called for a minimum monthly salary of around 9,000 rupees (¬£105) as well as sick pay and holiday.

Rights group Anti-Slavery International said more than four million workers are employed in India in the unregulated domestic sector, with wages typically two thirds lower than other industries.

The line between domestic work and slavery is also often blurred, with many employed in private homes, leaving them open to poor working conditions, exploitation and abuse.

One woman, Seema, said she was abused by her employers for two years before seeking help from the National Domestic Workers' Movement, Anti-Slavery International‚Äôs partners in India.

She said: ‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt paid for the work that I did over two years, except for the absolute minimum that I needed to survive. My employers would shout at me, insult me and beat me.‚Äù

Geeta Menon, of non-profit Stree Jagruti Samiti, which focuses on domestic workers' rights, said there was little clarity on how the objectives would be met.

""Neither the government nor the employers are convinced that these workers should have rights and benefits; in fact, they do not even recognise them as workers,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.

""The policy itself is weak, there is no onus on employers, and we see little chance of it being effectively implemented.

‚ÄúUnless our attitudes towards domestic workers changes, their situation will not improve.‚Äù",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-minimum-wage-domestic-workers-labour-ministry-a8005711.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiMt5jW8qroAhU8zzgGHS-QC4QQFjACegQICBAC&usg=AOvVaw3ePaL9xPVnVCD4VYfLHqSD,
Ikea's first store in India is a case study for international retailers,"Parina Lamba, four, knew what she wanted in the new Ikea store here, the first by the Swedish retail giant in India. She hopped onto a daybed on the showroom floor, lay down and would not get off.

‚ÄúShe didn‚Äôt sit on any other bed,‚Äù says Parina‚Äôs father, Sarav Lamba, one of about 7,000 people to get early access to Ikea‚Äôs store a few days before the grand opening.

Lamba was sold. The Hemnes bed was like none other he had seen in Hyderabad, featuring a pullout tray that allows it to become a double bed ‚Äì perfect for when Parina‚Äôs grandmother comes to visit, he says. At 39,970 rupees, or ¬£430, with two mattresses, the price was fair, he adds. And as an engineer, he is looking forward to putting it together with his daughter‚Äôs help. ‚ÄúI love DIY,‚Äù he says.

Ikea, the world‚Äôs largest furniture retailer, is betting that millions of middle and upper-class Indians are similar to the Lambas. Six years after it was first planned, the 400,000 square foot store in Hyderabad is the first step towards fulfilling Ikea‚Äôs ambitions in the country, with more outlets scheduled to debut in Mumbai, Bangalore and the Delhi area in the next two years. By 2025, the company hopes to have 25 stores in India, some of them in a new, small format.

Ikea‚Äôs opening in India ‚Äì and its subsequent success or failure ‚Äì is likely to become a case study for other international retailers.

India‚Äôs retail landscape is complex. With a growing middle class, its 1.3 billion people buy about $30bn (¬£23bn) a year of furniture, lighting and household items like bed linens and cookware, according to Technopak, an Indian consulting firm.

But despite the efforts of a few local chains, 95 per cent of those goods are sold through small shops that offer custom-built products, usually specialising in one category such as wooden furniture or lamps, and free assembly and delivery.

‚ÄúThe consumer in India is kind of pampered,‚Äù says Ankur Bisen, who heads Technopak‚Äôs retail and consumer products division.

Ikea stores are the polar opposite. Part showroom and part warehouse, they are sprawling outlets that are far from city centres with mazes of giant bins and floor-to-ceiling shelves. Ikea‚Äôs brand signals affordable, mass-produced and functional, and its design aesthetic is lightweight and lean, in contrast to the heavier, bulkier furniture traditionally favoured in Indian households.

Yet Ikea, with its reputation for good value, also appeals to the bargain-hunting nature of the Indian shopper.

‚ÄúIn India, a lot is driven by the price of the goods and not so much about the quality,‚Äù says Anil Talreja, a partner at Deloitte‚Äôs India arm who works with retailers.

All of this has forced Ikea to rethink its product lineup and store operations for India. Although the Hyderabad store has the classic Ikea layout, what‚Äôs on display is somewhat different.

Given India‚Äôs lower income levels, the store features hundreds of products ‚Äì from dolls to spice jars ‚Äì priced at less than 100 rupees. In some cases, Ikea is selling a product in India for less than it charges elsewhere. In other instances, the company is tailoring it for local tastes. For example, most Indians do not use knives to eat and primarily want spoons, so the company ditched its children‚Äôs plastic cutlery packs and instead sells four spoons for 15 rupees.

Ikea employees also visited about 1,000 homes in various cities to understand how people lived and what they needed. Indian families spend a lot of time together, with relatives frequently popping in, so the company added more folding chairs and stools that could serve as flexible seating.

Indian women are also shorter than Europeans and Americans, so the company decided to showcase some cabinets and countertops at lower heights. And with children often sleeping in the same room as their parents until they are in elementary school, its model bedroom squeezes in a child‚Äôs bed amid all the other furniture.

‚ÄúWe want to be as relevant as possible,‚Äù says Nick Elliott, an Australian who heads interior design for Ikea‚Äôs Hyderabad store. Even the cafeteria caters to Indian tastes, with biryani, samosas and vegetarian Swedish meatballs on the menu and 1,000 available seats, more than any other Ikea in the world, to accommodate the more leisurely dining style of Indian families.

Figuring out how to adapt Ikea‚Äôs furniture was more difficult. Some items popular in the United States, such as untreated pine furniture, do not endure in south India‚Äôs hot and humid climate. Metal or wooden furniture needs small risers to lift it off the floor because people frequently clean their floors with water.

In Hyderabad, Ikea is in an area known as Hitec City, where thousands of new apartments are going up and multinational tech companies like Amazon, Dell, Capgemini, Tech Mahindra and Deloitte have offices. Many customers at the store last weekend worked at those companies or were familiar with Ikea from other countries.

In the city‚Äôs traditional furniture district, Nampally, furniture sellers say they are not worried about Ikea stealing their business. The new store will get people excited about buying furniture, they say, and customers will come to check out the local options, too.

Srinithdas Mundhada, whose 45-year-old store sells metal furniture like storage cabinets and cheap plastic chairs and stools, says that he and his family have already become adept at competing with big foreign-owned retailers.

‚ÄúWe are cheaper than Amazon,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúWe welcome Ikea with a warm heart.‚Äù

Google employees confess all the things they hated most about working at Google,"A job at Google.

It's career heaven, right? How could a gig at the biggest, most ambitious tech company on the planet possibly be bad?

Well, take a look at this Quora thread, which is being constantly updated by current and former Google employees to dish the dirt on working for the search giant.

Turns out that working at Google isn't all free food and bike rides around campus.

Take their complaints with a grain of salt. These are the complainers, after all. But we've heard many of these same things from our own sources. ‚Üì‚Üì‚Üì

""You are given everything you could ever want, but it costs you the only things that actually matter in the end.""

Joe Cannella, former senior account manager: ""Basically, you end up spending the majority of your life eating Google food, with Google coworkers, wearing Google gear, talking in Google acronyms, sending Google emails on Google phones, and you eventually start to lose sight of what it's like to be independent of the big G, and every corner of your life is set up to reinforce the idea that you would be absolutely insane to want to be anywhere else.""

""To which the majority of folks will say 'boo-hoo, poor spoiled Googler'. But that's sort of the point. You are given everything you could ever want, but it costs you the only things that actually matter in the end.""

It's hard to be honest with your colleagues.

Vlad Patryshev, former software engineer: ""It is really hard to discuss any issue unless it is your friend you are talking to ... Objective discussions are pretty rare, since everybody's territorial, and not interested in opinions of other people unless those people are Important Gods.""

No one believes you if you say it isn't awesome.

Katy Levinson, Former software engineer, Infrastructure: ""People feel justified asking you why you left or if you still work there, and insist that everything must be perfect. They don't want to hear anything less than total enthusiasm for your luck getting into Google, and how much you want to stay. If you left or have anything other than rainbows and ponies to talk about, nearly everybody from my mother to my cab driver pretty much demands you explain why you'd be anything less than thrilled to work at Google.""

They can hire the very best people ‚Äî so *everyone* is overqualified.

Anonymous: ""There are students from top 10 colleges who are providing tech support for Google's ads products, or manually taking down flagged content from YouTube, or writing basic code to A|B test the color of a button on a site.""

Middle management is dangerously political.

Anonymous: ""The most obvious areas that this political nature manifests itself is in performance management and recruiting. The amount of horse-trading and manipulation that a manager needs to do to be able to manage their team within the system as it was (I understand that it's recently changed somewhat) is morale-breaking. To promote someone, you need to start making a case about a year in advance, and because of the curve, that means you can't really give as much credit to other people on your team.""

There are too few ""bozos.""

""There are enough talented people that being talented won't guarantee you an inside track on good projects, because there are thousands of equally smart people ahead in the queue and equally underutilised, but there are just enough bozos that you have to prove that you're not one of them,"" said a former engineer.

You can work there for eight years and never get a promotion.

Anonymous: ""You can fall through the cracks, and you can fall hard. I know people who have been SWE's for 8+ years, still L4, have never been promoted.""

Google staff are so outstanding that there's an internal joke about it.

Anonymous: ""I used to joke with my colleagues that Larry & Sergey go out on their yachts ‚Äî tie them together, sit back on the same recliners you'll find on their jumbo jet, each on his own yacht/set of yachts, smoke cigars, and put up pictures of Googlers with little snippets like 'was a GM at multi-national telecomm company, got a Harvard MBA and is now answering Orkut tickets.' and then they would erupt in laughter and clink their cigars & Scotch together in celebration. This, of course, is highly unlikely given neither of them would ever smoke a cigar or drink Scotch. Remainder is plausible.""

Google is so big it can hire you by mistake.

Anonymous: ""I was approached by Google to take on a management position. At the same time I was hired, another person with the same name was hired. Somewhere, HR got things horribly mixed up and when I started I was in a very different, very junior position instead which would have been appropriate for the other candidate of the same name. The employment contract was ambiguous and the relevant HR staff had long since left to work for another company so no-one could clear it up.""

""Ultimately Google paid for my household belongings to be shipped across the world and then immediately back home again for no good reason other than ""this does not compute, error, error, error"".

The company only cares about measurable improvements.

Katy Levinson: ""Any improvement not based on a hard metric was flatly not a respected use of time,"" said a former Google software engineer. ""Usability? Number of bugs? Nobody cared. If you couldn't measure it, nobody was interested in it.""

Projects get can cancelled arbitrarily all the time.

Anonymous: ""The biggest negative, by far, for me has been seemingly arbitrary project cancellations,"" said an anonymous commenter. ""To add insult to injury, people who worked on canceled projects have promotion applications denied for failing to have made an impact.""

""In the Bay Area the cost of living is insane.""

Adrian Carballo, former Software Engineer: ""In the Bay Area the cost of living is insane, and if you work off of the MTV campus there isn't even that much to do other than working or hanging out with your coworkers. Lame. You do have free food available all the time, and many cafes, gyms, laundry rooms, etc. but over time as you start using all these perks (because it's just too convenient) you spend more and more of your time at the office. You start making the same choices day in and day out. You hang out more and more with the same people you work with.""

""I ended up deciding it was time to move on to more freedom. ... even if I have to pay for it.""

""PS. I'm also leaving the Bay Area really soon.""

""There is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.""

""People are promoted into management positions ‚Äî not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into,"" said a former technical program manager. ""So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.""

""Jealous friends who hate on your job because they didn't get in.""

Anonymous: ""The spotlight. Quora questions, jealous friends who hate on your job because they didn't get in, suspicious media articles claiming every move by the company ties into some centralised advertising master plan, etc. This gets old. Nobody will just let you have your job.""

""I met 100 triathletes in my three years at Google. Only a handful of them were interesting people.""

""They hire the same person over and over again,"" said an anonymous commenter. ""Same background, same 10 schools, same worldview, same interests. It's no exaggeration to say that I met 100 triathletes in my three years at Google. Only a handful of them were interesting people.""

""The worst part of working at Google ... [was] feeling under-utilised.""

John L. Miller, former Staff Software Engineer: ""The worst part of working at Google for me was, as for many others, feeling under-utilised. As someone with ~25 years of programming, management, and architecture experience, I wasn't doing anything that a good college hire with ~2 years of experience couldn't do faster and just as well. That's a depressing situation.""

""Get EVERYTHING in writing.""

""If you are in the process of gaining employment with Google, negotiate hard, be demanding, and make sure to get EVERYTHING in writing. Google makes lots of vague promises, and seems to not deliver.""

Don't believe the hype.

Jeff Nelson, invented Google Chrome: ""A very large fraction of what you hear about Google - from outside Google - is bullshit. Often, this bullshit is propagated by Googlers, because it helps the company's reputation. When someone comes up with a really good piece of bullshit, they may even earn some respect among the other Google engineers. It's considered 'Googley' to make Google sound like an amazing place to work, even if the statement is largely bullshit.""

Not working at HQ is ""career suicide.""

Anonymous: ""Obviously one can always opt to work at remote offices, but that is a career suicide longterm-wise.""

Your office space can be too small.

Anne K. Halsall, product designer: ""[I]f you have to work in one of the four main campus buildings, you will most likely be extremely cramped. It's not uncommon to see 3-4 employees in a single cube, or several managers sharing an office. With all the open areas for food, games, TV, tech talks, etc, it can be surprisingly hard to find a quiet, private place to think.""

Google is so big you can't have any impact on it.

""I worked at Google for 3 years and it was very difficult to leave but there was one major factor that helped me make the decision ‚Äî the impact I could ever have on the business as an individual was minimal. As noted in many answers below, Google is an incredible machine that prints money thanks to AdWords. Unless you are an amazingly talented engineer who gets to create something new, chances are you're simply a guy/girl with an oil can greasing the cogs of that machine.""

Middle management is mediocre.

""I'd say the relentless daily mediocre thinking of middle management types who are completely focused on metrics to the exclusion of all other factors. They don't want to rock the boat, they don't know how to inspire their workforce, and they rely far too much on the Google name and reputation to do that for them.""

Googlers can get caught up in trivia.

""In Zurich there is a quiet room where people go to relax, or take a nap. There are very nice looking fish tanks there and you can waste as much of your work time there, watching the fish do fishy things. There was a 100+ emails thread about removing the massage chairs from that room because some people allegedly were being kept from sleeping because the massage chairs were too noisy.""

The culture is immature.

""It's like never-never land ‚Äî people never grow up. They drink at all hours, socialize constantly, play games, and do little to no work.""

You can't work remotely.

Dimitar Bojantchev, freelance: ""The killer to me was the inability to work remotely, which I have been doing successfully for the past 5-6 years.""

Staff are rewarded for dreaming up new things even when new things aren't needed.

Katy Levinson: ""This lead to imaginative unmaintained nightmares, frequently based on discarded shells of other platforms nobody maintained. We had four internal-only official JavaScript libraries. Why? Because writing an innovative JavaScript library could get you a promotion!""

""I was genuinely out of my league.""

Paul Buttery, senior product analyst: ""My first week was more intimidating than anticipated. I fell for what‚Äôs commonly referred to as imposter syndrome. The members of my new team were insanely smart and accomplished. Not ‚ÄòI got straight A‚Äôs in college‚Äô smart. More like ‚ÄòI created Google Mars and published a dozen patents before I was of legal drinking age‚Äô smart.""

""Most had worked with Sebastian Thrun (self-driving cars, Udacity) at Stanford or on Maps. How was I going to provide value here? In hindsight, I was genuinely out of my league.""

""Stepford engineers.""

Nathan Yospe, former engineer: ""The engineers Google hires fit the mold of generalist system types. They are good at algorithms, database concepts, transaction processing, scaling, etc. They generally do not have domain expertise in product areas. The culture rewards engineers who solve knotty technical problems and leaves behind those who enjoy the harder part of product development, moving a product from version 1 to a truly great version 3 by smoothing out the rough edges and adding functionality based on customer feedback, and by maintaining and debugging a product.""

Bad managers can make a career there.

Nathan Yospe: ""I worked at one of the larger non-MV campuses, and the only intellectual stimulation I encountered in my time there was the interview process. Not that I met that many brilliant people, but I did meet a lot of fairly mediocre people that were convinced they were brilliant, and I saw a lot of political ass kissing. I worked under a team lead who hadn't touched code in over two years, and had been incompetent as a programmer when she was one, with a tech lead who was okay at UX, but not much else.""

"Ratan Tata, the UK's largest private sector employer, steps down","Ratan Tata‚Äôs retirement yesterday, on his 75th birthday, from the chairmanship of Tata Sons, India‚Äôs biggest conglomerate, marks the end of an era for Indian business as well as the group. No-one has bestraddled Indian business in the way that he has done, presiding over Tata‚Äôs $100bn-plus revenues, more than half from 80 countries overseas, with over 450,000 employees in 100 operating companies and interests ranging from tea to telecoms, software to hotels, wrist watches to defence rockets, and coffee (Starbucks) to power and steel.

There is no other Indian business figure of similar stature, and no one near to being able to take his place as a symbol of managerial ethics and success. He took over in 1991, the year of India‚Äôs economic reforms, first uniting the loosely run group under the Tata banner, ousting elderly satraps, and then using opportunities unleashed by the reforms to spend $20bn on foreign take-overs and become India‚Äôs first group with $100bn revenues (2011-12). His dream for 2020-21 is $500bn.

He strove for a corruption-free group, and lost influence in Delhi and elsewhere as a result ‚Äì he has always seemed uncomfortable with the complexities of political and corporate corruption that has grown enormously in India during the past 20 years. ‚ÄúI can say, with my hand to my heart, that we have not in fact partaken in any clandestine activity,‚Äù Mr Tata said last year when being questioned about his group‚Äôs involvement in a far-reaching telecoms scandal. ‚ÄúI think there are many honest businessmen. There are many that bend. I am happy that I have not bent‚Äù.

But such a massive array of businesses could never fully match the ‚Äúexemplary‚Äù ethics and values that he has said he would like to be his legacy, and he unwisely hired Nira Radia, an influence peddler at the centre of a telecoms-linked political crisis in 2010, as his trusted public and government relations adviser. His companies‚Äô environmental record has also not always been as good as he would like it to appear, especially in the extractive industries, and his lack of concern was demonstrated by the construction of the Dhamra Port in Orissa in 2008.

His biggest contribution has been to spearhead Indian companies‚Äô foreign investments abroad, starting rather unexcitingly with the purchase of Tetley Tea in the UK in 2000. Much more significant was a take-over of South Korea‚Äôs Daewoo truck manufacturer in 2004. This was a trailblazer because it showed that someone in India‚Äôs largely unimpressive and uncompetitive manufacturing industry had the ability and nerve to venture abroad. I have always thought that this deal was a turning point in Indian industry‚Äôs self-confidence, which then grew rapidly in the mid-late 2000s.

It led on in 2007 to Tata Motors‚Äô $2.3bn purchase from Ford Motor of the Jaguar Land Rover business, which has been a huge success. Sceptics criticised the deal because they had not foreseen that, by capitalising on design work started but not carried through by Ford, Tata had the energy, finance and managerial strength to produce impressive new models and expand sales internationally, especially in China. This demonstrated Mr Tata's capacity to drive through his decisions, as he also did, against advice from senior colleagues, on his far less successful $11bn take-over in 2007 of Europe‚Äôs Corus steel business that has left Tata Steel heavily indebted.

He then spearheaded the misguided concept and launch in 2009 of the Nano, the world‚Äôs cheapest car, which failed to take off. Aspirational Indian families, who Mr Tata dreamed of upgrading from unsafe over-loaded scooters, did not want to own the world‚Äôs cheapest product ‚Äì it has now been re-launched slightly upmarket and is doing better.

Tata Motors was the company where Mr Tata had most direct influence and significantly, he spent yesterday, his last day at work, at its Pune factory. But the company‚Äôs India operations need an overhaul now that it is no longer controlled by the patriarch, as do the steel and telecommunications businesses plus, according to some reports (left), the Taj hotels. The company that needs least attention is TCS, the information technology cash cow.

Over the last two decades, Mr Tata has changed many parts of the group and has led it abroad to many countries including the UK where it is the largest private sector employer. He has did that at a time when other big Indian companies, which thrive by bribing the Delhi and state governments, were shy of venturing into unknown territories.

He now retires to be chairman of the Tata‚Äôs charitable trusts that own 66% of the group, having handed over as chairman of Tata Sons, the main holding company, to Cyrus Mistry, a 44-year old businessman linked to the Tata family by marriage and the Parsi religion, and to the group by an 18% equity stake.

Mr Tata‚Äôs leadership has symbolised ethics and vision, despite a few bumps, and the gap left by his retirement is the absence of an Indian businessman with a similar renowned image in India and abroad.

The 'untouchable' Indians with an unenviable job,"There is an infectious, impassioned enthusiasm about Bezwada Wilson that is hard to ignore. He laughs, he smiles. He frowns too, but soon he is smiling again. And yet things might have been very different. When he was aged 18, he came very close to taking his own life. The thing that led him to the very edge was the discovery of what his parents really did to scrape together a living.

Growing up in a gold mining area of southern India, they had told him as a child that they mined for ore. The evening they revealed to him that they were actually ""dry latrine"" cleaners who spent their days covered in the filth of others, he was so horrified, so disgusted, that he came close to committing suicide at a secluded water tower. After hours of weeping, wrestling with his thoughts, he decided he was better off alive, fighting to help people like his parents.

Two decades later, his efforts have been nothing short of remarkable. As head of a nationwide organisation that has confronted head-on some of his country's most ingrained prejudice, he believes he is close to eradicating the dehumanising practice known as ""manual scavenging"".

Ten years ago, there were around three million people employed as manual scavengers in India; today there are fewer than 600,000. By the end of the year, he believes the figure will be zero. ""Once people realise that it's slavery, they want to stop. The problem is that it's never discussed publicly,"" Mr Wilson said.

Dry latrines are toilets that do not flush. In most Indian homes, such latrines have been replaced with flush systems. In 1993, a law ruled all dry latrines should be destroyed and the practice of manual scavenging abolished. But in pockets of India, especially in poorer states such as Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Bihar, the practice has persisted.

In India, the people employed to clean such toilets have always been members of groups of ""Untouchable"" or Dalit people. Equipped with nothing more sophisticated than a brush and bucket or pieces of cardboard, such groups have cleaned the toilets of higher-caste people, carrying away the waste, or ""nightsoil"", in baskets placed on their heads.

Payment for such work is minimal; many scavengers say they do it because they have always done so, because their parents and grandparents did the same. Activists say it is a form of bondage.

The work of a scavenger is filthy and soul-destroying. One morning I accompanied two women, members of the Balmiki clan, as they went about their work on the edge of the city of Ambala, in Haryana.

Cheranji Kaur and Seema clean six dry latrines every morning, using a brush to sweep away the waste into a nearby open drain. ""I started this work at the age of 10,"" said 35-year-old Mrs Kaur. ""My parents did it, our ancestors did it. I'd go with my parents; that is how you learn.""

The women made their way around a scruffy, higher-caste neighbourhood where they set about cleaning the toilets. One resident threw a bucket of water into the latrine, sending the waste splashing and gushing as the two women used their brushes to clean it away. The air was sour and corrosive. It was a sad sight, made worse by the women's determination to try to retain their dignity as they worked, and keep their clothes clean, gold bangles bouncing on their wrists.

One of the latrines belonged to a family of Sikhs, a religion whose founder utterly rejected the notion of caste differences. The head of the household, Mahinder Singh, said he paid the women 50 rupees (71p) a month and that ""it had always been the Balmiki who cleaned the toilets"".

Mr Singh added: ""Everybody gets it done so we get it done. Those who are supposed to do it, should do it. I did not know it was illegal.""

Mr Wilson's campaign has two aims: to raise awareness among groups of scavengers that they do not have to perform such tasks, and then help them find alternative work. A key element of his publicity drives, or yatras, is the symbolic burning of the scavengers' wooden baskets and the destruction of the dry latrines themselves.

In one incident in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, activists discovered a block of supposedly outlawed dry latrines in a court complex, which were being used by judges. When activists destroyed the toilets, officials did not dare protest, aware that the existence of the latrines had been in breach of the law.

Mrs Kaur and Seema revealed that they laboured every day for around 150 rupees a month. They said the work was difficult, it was hard to get rid of the smell and they suffered widespread discrimination.

""We do it because there is no other work,"" said Mrs Kaur, who has two young children. ""The other communities will not let us inside their homes to work as cleaners or domestic servants. Any work would be better than this; a little shop, a vegetable cart, or rearing cattle.""

Seema added: ""I don't feel good doing this work, people look at us different, they look down at us.""

Largely as a result of the work of Mr Wilson and his group Safai Karmachari Andolan (SKA), there are now just a handful of scavengers in the state of Haryana. One of those who was ""rehabilitated"" is Saroj Balla. She had worked as a scavenger all her life to earn enough to send her children to school. Thirty years ago, members of her community even struggled to buy vegetables; vendors would put them on the floor rather than hand them over directly.

Once, when Mrs Balla was pregnant, she fell from a ladder while descending from a dry latrine located on a roof, collapsing on the floor in a slew of human waste. The toilet owners refused to help her, instead prodding her with a stick to make her get to her feet.

Five years ago, activists from SKA, which receives support and some funding from Christian Aid, which is based in London, arrived in Ambala and told Mrs Balla and others that they were not required to perform such degrading work. ""They told us we had a right to a better life,"" Mrs Balla said, her voice swelling. ""We all knew it was dirty work. We took courage from the people who came to talk with us.""

The 50-year-old recalled the day that she and other scavengers went out and demolished 15 dry latrines in the area. The toilets' owners had told them to clean them, but instead the group of women used heavy sticks to break them up. ""I felt very good,"" said Mrs Balla, who now works as a domestic help. ""It felt like a rebirth."" Her advice to the other two women was simple: definitely stop.

Mr Wilson, 44, who presented a piece of brick from a demolished dry latrine to Navi Pillay, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, talks about eradicating all scavenging by 31 December of this year. Volunteers are currently holding rallies across the country and will descend on Delhi at the end of the month.

By then he believes the number of people working as scavengers will have been reduced from 600,000 to 300,000, giving him two months to finish his task.

""Everything is messed up. People say we are unclean, but who has made us unclean? We are cleaners; the person shitting in a dry latrine is the dirty person,"" he said. ""For thousands of years we have been told we are dirty. Now people are shouting back, 'No, we are not dirty'.""",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-untouchable-indians-with-an-unenviable-job-2106970.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiMt5jW8qroAhU8zzgGHS-QC4QQFjAIegQIBBAC&usg=AOvVaw0iq-LBahGXrRt7-hwul7tS,
India moves to open up job quotas to upper castes for first time,"The Indian government has introduced a bill in parliament that would for the first time open up quotas for public sector jobs and higher education places to the upper castes.

Under India‚Äôs constitution, 50 per cent of spaces at many public institutions are reserved for members of ‚Äúscheduled castes‚Äù such as dalits (formerly untouchables) and the lower strata of the Hindu caste system.

The reservations were introduced after independence in an attempt to overturn the historic disadvantages faced by India‚Äôs lower castes, but have become an effective way for political parties to pander to large voting blocs at elections.

Prime minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs cabinet has now approved an amendment to the constitution that would set aside another 10 per cent of government jobs and university places for the ‚Äúeconomically weaker sections of society‚Äù, beyond the scheduled castes.

The policy would aid households with an annual income of less than 800,000 rupees (¬£8,950), while India‚Äôs average income sits at around a tenth of that value. In a note accompanying the legislation, the government admitted it would encompass ‚Äúa considerable part of the Indian population‚Äù.

Opponents painted the change, which was introduced to the lower house of India‚Äôs parliament on Tuesday, as an attempt to ‚Äúappease‚Äù upper caste voters with just a few months to go until a general election.

And it comes on the same day as the lower house passed another law, the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which would give citizenship to non-Muslim minorities who have moved to India away from alleged persecution in neighbouring Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Home minister Rajnath Singh told parliament such people ‚Äúhave no place to go except India‚Äù. But critics said the bill was a blatant move to bolster the BJP‚Äôs Hindu voter base.

Protesters burned tyres and damaged two BJP offices in the northeastern state of Assam, where immigration along its long open border is a contentious issue, and police said 700 were arrested. Protest leaders said the government bill would issue citizenship on the basis of religion, in violation of India‚Äôs secular constitution.

Rajdeep Sardesai, a political commentator and author, said that ‚Äúbe it the 10 per cent quota or Citizenship Amendment Bill, it only reaffirms that while our constitution builders spoke of individual rights, electoral politics only cares for vote banks‚Äù.

Dilip Mandal, a journalist who tracks caste politics in India, told Al Jazeera: ‚ÄúWhat the government is doing now is an appeasement of the upper castes, who are already over-represented in bureaucracy, judiciary, media and echelons of corporate power.‚Äù

Despite its strong Lok Sabha (lower house) majority, the BJP might struggle to pass any changes to the quota system ‚Äì constitutional amendments require a special majority of two-thirds in both houses to pass. But it could be enough to buy support for the BJP from groups that have long resented the affirmative action as diminishing their own access to much-sought-after public sector jobs.

In an op-ed, Ashoka University vice-chancellor Pratap Bhanu Mehta described the quota policy as a ‚Äútoken signal‚Äù that ‚Äúadmits this government‚Äôs massive failure‚Äù to create jobs in the private sector. ‚ÄúGone are the narratives of a buoyant economy lifting all boats,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúWe are now back to distributing crumbs.‚Äù

The government said the move would improve opportunities for all poorer citizens ‚Äì whether they be from Hindu upper castes or from religious minorities such as Muslims and Christians.

Shahnawaz Hussain, national spokesperson for Mr Modi‚Äôs ruling BJP party, called it ‚Äúyet another step based on the philosophy of Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas‚Äù ‚Äì a favourite Modi slogan meaning ‚Äúcollective efforts, inclusive growth‚Äù.

Ramdas Athawale, the BJP minister for social justice and empowerment, told the Indian Express: ‚ÄúMy demand has always been for 25 per cent reservation for the upper caste poor; 10 per cent is a good start.‚Äù",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-bjp-schedule-castes-ruling-government-job-quotas-a8717346.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwiMt5jW8qroAhU8zzgGHS-QC4QQFjAJegQIBRAC&usg=AOvVaw2glUqtnRsHQNA0hjezVtHL,
Staff may sue City law firm for outsourcing jobs to India,"A group of employees at Allen & Overy is threatening to sue the City law firm for breach of contract over its decision to outsource more than half its document processing division to India.

The firm told staff last Friday that about 45 of the 85 employees in its data processing division would be made redundant as the work was transferred to India's fourth largest city Chennai, formerly known as Madras.

Staff have been told that they must re-apply for their jobs and re-sit an interview if they wish to stay at Allen & Overy. The new outsourcing arrangements, which follow on from a six-week pilot scheme, are due to be in place by November.

A number of employees are now seeking legal representation to bring a claim of breach of contract arguing that they have no idea what the new jobs will entail or what the hours and salary will be.

There is also concern that outsourcing the production of what are often highly commercially sensitive and confidential legal documents could compromise security.

Allen & Overy advises on takeover deals and complicated restructurings such as the one completed recently by telecom equipment manufacturer Marconi.

The move by Allen & Overy makes it one of a growing number of UK firms to outsource operations to India and other developing countries. Companies which have already blazed a trail to India include BT, Tesco and Goldman Sachs.

An email sent to staff at Allen & Overy last week said the outsourcing move was ""the most competitive business solution"" for the document production division in terms of quality, service and overall cost effectiveness.

Steven Chernikeeff, head of operational services at the firm, said savings would be in excess of ¬£1m and dismissed fears that security would be compromised.

""I have visited India myself and the conditions are first rate - the equivalent of western standards"". He said that all documents would be sent by virtual private network, staff in India would be dedicated to working on Allen & Overy material and physical security at the offices was excellent.

He said he was not aware of any legal action by staff in London but maintained that the firm had followed ""all due processes correctly"".",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/staff-may-sue-city-law-firm-for-outsourcing-jobs-to-india-87066.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3xJm686roAhUhxzgGHVj9CSs4ChAWMAB6BAgEEAI&usg=AOvVaw2iv7bmz2ZPwzsC2FEbn4Hd,
Power back after blackout in India,"Factories and workshops were running again yesterday after electrical grid collapses caused the world's two worst power blackouts.

An estimated 620 million people lost power when India's northern, eastern and north-eastern grids failed on Tuesday afternoon. On Monday, the northern grid failed, leaving 370 million people powerless.

After Tuesday's failure, workers managed to return power to the 20 affected states within hours.

India's new Power Minister, Veerappa Moily, said that by yesterday morning power had been restored across the country. Mr Moily, who took up his post on Tuesday, said an investigation had begun and he did not want to apportion blame or speculate about the cause.

Other officials said the blackout might have been the result of states drawing too much power from the grid. Some analysts dismissed that explanation, saying if that was the cause, such collapses would happen all the time.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/power-back-after-blackout-in-india-7999502.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3xJm686roAhUhxzgGHVj9CSs4ChAWMAF6BAgIEAI&usg=AOvVaw1lgGJpayg2xWCOtRFFR-Wu,
Amazon promises to create 1m jobs in India as Jeff Bezos trip descends into PR nightmare,"On the final day of a visit to India that is fast becoming a PR nightmare, Jeff Bezos announced that Amazon will create one million more jobs in the Asian country by 2025.

The chief executive, who also owns the Washington Post and is ranked by Forbes and Bloomberg as the richest person in the world, has this week been meeting Indian small business owners and rubbing shoulders with Bollywood royalty at corporate events.

Dressed mostly in traditional Indian clothing, he has flown kites with children, laid a wreath at the Gandhi memorial in Delhi and taken a selfie on stage during his keynote speech at a major business summit.

But his three-day trip has been overshadowed by loud anti-Amazon protests organised by a federation of bricks-and-mortar business owners, as well as critical comments by senior members of Narendra Modi‚Äôs ruling party and the launch of a probe into Amazon‚Äôs business model by the competition authority.

Friday‚Äôs statement from Mr Bezos said the job creation would be achieved through investments in infrastructure, technology and logistics. A 2018 regulation means Amazon can no longer sell its own brand products in India and must instead provide a marketplace for local manufacturers and producers.

Mr Bezos said the company was ‚Äúexcited about what lies ahead‚Äù and has been gushing in his praise of India throughout the trip, at one point saying that ‚Äúthe 21st century is going to be an Indian century‚Äù and describing cooperation between the US and India as ‚Äúthe most important alliance in the 21st century‚Äù.

India, it seems, is not so enamoured with him. A Reuters report said Mr Modi had rebuffed repeated requests from Amazon to meet Mr Bezos during his visit for a prime ministerial photo opportunity.

On Thursday, while the CEO took part in a chummy interaction with the actor Shah Rukh Khan at a Mumbai event promoting Amazon‚Äôs Prime Video, most media focused instead on the scathing comments of India's trade minister Piyush Goyal at a security conference in Delhi.

Dismissing Amazon‚Äôs announcement of $1bn investment in India, made at the start of Bezos‚Äôs trip, Mr Goyal told the audience that ‚Äúit‚Äôs not as if they are doing a great favour to India‚Äù. He said Amazon had been operating at a loss of around that much over the last year, so ‚Äúif they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars‚Äù.

On Friday, another senior politician ‚Äì Vijay Chauthaiwale, the chief of the ruling BJP‚Äôs foreign affairs department ‚Äì took a swipe at Mr Bezos‚Äôs Washington Post for its coverage of India, which he called ‚Äúhighly biased and agenda driven‚Äù.

Without giving any examples, Mr Chauthaiwale said there were ‚Äúa lot of problems‚Äù with the Post‚Äôs reporting. ‚ÄúI am not opposing Amazon as a company, in fact I am a regular customer‚Ä¶ Jeff Bezos should go home tell Washington Post what is his impression about India,‚Äù he said.

But it is the vocal protest movement against Amazon that is likely to have hurt Mr Bezos the most, with placard-waving demonstrators attending outside the business summit he addressed.

Rallies were organised in 300 cities across the country by powerful retail lobbying group the Confederation of All India Traders, which claims to speak for the up to 25 per cent of the population dependent on small businesses.

The group argues that Amazon is putting people out of business with predatory pricing and other ‚Äúmalpractices‚Äù. Its national secretary, Sumit Agarwal, called Mr Bezos an ‚Äúeconomic terrorist‚Äù.

And on Monday, the Competition Commission of India ordered an investigation into whether Amazon and the mostly Walmart-owned e-commerce site Flipkart use ‚Äúexclusionary tactic[s] to foreclose competition‚Äù.

Amazon said it was ‚Äúconfident in our compliance‚Äù with marketplace regulations and would ‚Äúwelcome the opportunity to address allegations made about Amazon‚Äù.

India's shopkeepers have represented a core constituency for the BJP since the early days of the party, and the comments of Mr Goyal and Mr Chauthaiwale have been widely shared by the party‚Äôs vociferous supporters online.

But industry executives warned that it was a risky manoeuvre that would likely put off international investment, at a time when the country's economic growth is already projected to fall to a 11-year low this year.

Indian politicians consider universal basic income following successful trials,"Indian politicians have met to discuss the possibility of introducing a universal basic income (UBI) after a survey suggested it could eradicate the widespread grinding poverty in the country.

Talks were held in Delhi to consider the controversial proposal ‚Äì which has economists and politicians fiercely divided.

Under UBI, all citizens ‚Äì regardless of income ‚Äì are given a basic amount to live on without being taxed, claiming benefits or having to meet other conditions.

Some on the left claim this frees people from poverty, opens up opportunities and can save the state money in the long-term while many on the right argue it increases state dependence and is unaffordable.

More than 80 Indian politicians, academics and experts attended the discussion held by the Institute for Human Development (IHD).

UBI has attracted serious attention in India following the success of recent pilot studies coupled with a widespread view that India‚Äôs current system of targeted welfare benefits and price subsidies is wasteful and inefficient.

However, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley recently stated that UBI is not feasible in the country due to ‚Äúpolitical limitations.‚Äù

Those in favour, including Professor Braneb Bardhan of the University of California, Berkeley, told the conference that a UBI of about a thousand rupees (about 15.5 USD or 13.5 EUR) per month is affordable through increasing taxes for the rich and ending certain government subsidies that primarily benefit the better-off.

But he warned that UBI should not replace all current welfare programmes or divert funding from public goods and services.

Critics including Professor Dreze termed the scheme a ""trojan horse"" which if implemented would be used to rationalise a reduction elsewhere in spending on essential social and economic services.

The conference heard that pilots conducted in rural villages in the state of Madhya Pradesh revealed the provision of UBI led to no increased spending on alcohol or other ‚Äútemptation goods‚Äù ‚Äì a common argument against the policy.

Short-term UBI was associated with many positive effects, including better nutrition, a decrease in serious health problems, higher rates of school attendance, lower debt, and greater job opportunities, especially for women, researchers claimed.

With an estimated population of 1.3 billion people,India has a rapidly growing economy, but around 29.5 per cent of people continue to live in poverty, according to a 2014 government report ‚Äì particularly in rural areas.

Professor Guy Standing, a founding member of the Basic Income Earth Network, told Business Insider UBI trials in India had been ‚Äúremarkably positive‚Äù, giving people a sense of control over their money, reducing debt and empowering women. ‚Äú

The concept of UBI received a boost when the government of Finland announced the introduction of a trial involving 2,000 unemployed people last year.

But India could face significant obstacles to implementing UBI which do not exist in Finland due to the vast differences in social and economic context.

The 2017 survey pointed out that India suffers from ‚Äúhigh levels of corruption, clientelism, rules and red tape‚Äù which could make delivering UBI difficult.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/ndia-politician-universal-basic-income-trials-discuss-poverty-employment-a7865541.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3xJm686roAhUhxzgGHVj9CSs4ChAWMAN6BAgJEAI&usg=AOvVaw3IVAKyOOWee6t7DspTRYOd,
Verghese Kurien: Engineer hailed as 'India's milkman',"The greatest irony about the achievement of Verghese Kurien ‚Äì the man who turned India's struggling dairy industry into the biggest in the world ‚Äì was that he never drank a drop of the stuff himself. ""I do not drink milk as I don't like it,"" he said. Whether he himself drank milk or not was not an issue: in a nation where malnutrition, particularly that of young children, remains rife, the engineer from Kerala transformed milk production, increasing yields fivefold. He was widely known as ""India's milkman"".

Verghese Kurien, born into a Christian family in the city of Kozhikode, was a young man when he was sent in 1949 on government duty to a state-owned creamery in Anand in the western state of Gujarat ‚Äì pay-back for having been sent abroad to the US to complete a masters' degree in mechanical engineering at Michigan State University.

After six months, the young engineer was reportedly preparing to leave when Tribhuvandas Patel, who was the chairman of what was then the Kaira district co-operative milk producers union, popularly known as ""Amul"", asked him to delay his departure and help oversee the overhaul of the co-operative's equipment. Kurien's decision to stay and help the small group of farmers, struggling to get a fair price for their milk against a local cartel of middlemen, has become the stuff of legend. One of his first undertakings was to persuade the farmers to invest in pasteurisation equipment to allow their product to be sold further afield.

Steadily, the Amul brand ‚Äì the name is derived from a Sanskrit word meaning invaluable ‚Äì grew into a state-wide cooperative known as the Gujarat co-operative milk marketing federation. With 3.2m members making milk, cheese, butter and ice-cream, today it ranks as the largest dairy brand in Asia. A majority of the co-operative's members are said to be women. (In the early days, Unicef and Oxfam helped with funding.)

The ""Amul model"" was soon emulated elsewhere in India and in a number of African countries, and in 1965 the man from Kerala was asked to become the first chairman of the government-founded National Dairy Development Board. In 1971, Mr Kurien was asked to head Operation Flood, a government-led undertaking that oversaw India's transformation from a net importer of milk to the world's biggest producer.

Carried out in three phases, the programme looked to the Amul model and established a network of milksheds and village cooperatives across the country. It also made use of funds derived from selling milk powder donated from European nations as part of the world food programme. Another essential factor was developing a process to turn buffalo milk into dry powder; despite the elevated status of cows within Hindu society, buffalos remain more numerous.

In terms of sheer numbers, the results of what became known as the White Revolution were clear. From producing 20m metric tonnes (MMT) of milk a year in 1960, the nation currently produces 122 MMT ‚Äì around 17 per cent of world production. Per capita consumption of milk has increased from 110g a day in 1970 to 240g today. In 1997, India overtook the US to become the world's largest producer.

But there were other, associated benefits. ""I think one of the most important results of the project was that it created employment in more than 100,000 villages across India,"" said BM Vyas, who was managing director of the co-operative and worked with Kurien for many decades.

Kurien, who in 1999 was awarded the Padma Vibhusan, India's second-highest civilian honour, was a firm believer that the co-operatives led to the social and political empowerment of those involved in the schemes, especially women. In an essay he wrote for a World Bank-sponsored book on poverty alleviation in South Asia, he said cooperatives benefited society. ""In a country like India, democracy rests on a fragile foundation,"" he wrote. ""One must underpin democracy with a plurality of rural institutions through which people can take direct control over matters that have an immediate effect on their lives.""

All good things must come to end. In 2006, Kurien, having become increasingly protective of the co-operative and concerned about private operators, resigned his position. A former prot√©g√©, Amrita Patel, head of the country's dairy development board, wanted to privatise the co-operative sector and Kurien was fiercely opposed to the move.

When he died earlier this month, having been suffering from kidney disease, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said Kurien's contribution to the development of India had been ""immeasurable"". He added: ""His greatest contribution was to give a position of pre-eminence to the farmer and his or her interests rather than those of the middleman.""

Prudential angers unions by outsourcing more jobs to India,"Prudential, the UK's second largest insurer, put itself on a collision course with the unions yesterday, as it announced plans to axe hundreds of jobs in the UK and once again increase the size of its workforce in India.

The move, which will affect about 700 jobs, will see the group close its sites in Bristol, Belfast and Egg's headquarters at Holborn Bars in London. Although the company guaranteed there would be no compulsory redundancies before the end of the year, and promised to offer jobs to those affected elsewhere in the group, unions reacted angrily to the news yesterday, accusing the company of looking to further ""exploit cheap labour"".

Prudential already employs more than 1,100 call centre and back office staff in Mumbai, India, and is expected to increase this significantly over the next few years to meet cost-saving targets.

Amicus said it was particularly disappointed with the news, coming just days after Peugeot announced the closure of its UK manufacturing plant at the cost of 2,300 jobs. ""Weak employment protection and globalisation are eating away at the heart of the UK economy,"" David Fleming, at Amicus, said. ""Finance and manufacturing fuels our wealth. Until the Government strengthens employment rights, more UK jobs will slip through our fingers.

""Amicus is prepared to fight these proposals and we will support our members in any action they choose to take to protect their jobs. We have told the company in no uncertain terms that we do not accept their proposals and that they are making no attempt to avoid compulsory redundancies. This goes completely against the spirit of agreements, which have basically been torn up by Prudential."" The job cuts are the first major move by Nick Prettejohn, Prudential's UK chief executive who joined the company in January from Lloyd's of London. Commenting on the announcement yesterday, Mr Prettejohn said the move was part of an ongoing strategy to establish a handful of core sites across the UK, and to continue delivering cost savings.

""These reorganisation proposals are an important step in delivering the cost savings that will enable the UK business to continue to build on the strong positions we have established across the financial services market,"" he said. ""Any change that results in redundancies is regrettable. We are consulting with unions and staff organisations and will make every effort to ensure that our people are kept informed and helped through this difficult transition period.""

Prudential had resisted closing the sites earlier due to an agreement with the unions in 2002, which promised the group would make no compulsory redundancies as a result of moving jobs offshore. The agreement expired a few weeks ago. About 500 people are employed at the Belfast plant, the majority of whom are expected to reject the offer of new jobs elsewhere in the group - as this would require relocation to England. Forty jobs will be lost at the Bristol plant, while a handful of jobs will be lost at Egg's headquarters.

The company said another plant in Reading would be closed in 2008, adding to the job cut tally. Earlier this year, the company cut 120 jobs in its finance department - 80 in Craigforth in Scotland and 40 in Reading. Prudential is one of a number of UK firms to outsource a large part of its back-office and call-centre operations to India. Aviva, Pru's biggest rival, has axed more than 5,000 jobs in the UK over the past few years, and employs almost 4,000 people in Asia.

Mr Fleming said conditions in India would no longer be as favourable for Pru as they were when they began building their workforce there several years ago. He said labour costs are rising 15 per cent a year in India, while staff turnover is up 70 per cent.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/prudential-angers-unions-by-outsourcing-more-jobs-to-india-475795.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3xJm686roAhUhxzgGHVj9CSs4ChAWMAd6BAgDEAI&usg=AOvVaw3lAMp5IuiaN9VYybHQgivO,
Air India welcomes back 'chubby' air hostesses,"India's embattled state carrier Air India has invited back former flight hostesses it sacked for being overweight as it seeks to overcome a severe shortage of cabin crew, a spokesman said Wednesday.

The company has approached nine to 10 women who were fired more than a year ago because they did not meet strict weight criteria for staff working in the cabin.

""About three of them have indicated that they would be willing to come back,"" the spokesman told AFP, asking not to be named in line with company policy.

He stressed that the weight limits were still in force - they are calculated based on height and age - and that the crew would have to be more svelte if they re-applied for their former jobs.

""We are not relaxing our standards,"" he said.

Sacked overweight women have unsuccessfully challenged Air India's policy in Indian courts, which upheld clauses in the group's employment contracts.

The crisis-hit airline has faced protests from passengers in recent weeks over severe delays to its flights caused by a shortage of cabin crew, endemic absenteeism and problems adapting to a new airport terminal in New Delhi.

The Hindustan Times newspaper reported Wednesday that the loss-making group, which is seeking a new government bailout, will run out of cash in the next few months and be unable to pay staff after March.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/air-india-welcomes-back-chubby-air-hostesses-2151141.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwi3xJm686roAhUhxzgGHVj9CSs4ChAWMAh6BAgFEAI&usg=AOvVaw3nl2uw-d8BzVENVhyz7j1U,
H&M accused of failing to ensure fair wages for global factory workers,"H&M has been accused of failing to pay the garment workers who supply its high-street stores a fair ‚Äúliving wage‚Äù.

As a result, many employees are forced to work excessive hours in order to survive, the Clean Clothes Campaign (CCC) has claimed.

After interviewing 62 people in six H&M supplier factories in India, Cambodia, Bulgaria and Turkey, they said none of the workers earned anything close to a living wage which would allow them to cover their families basic needs.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

The CCC said Sweden‚Äôs H&M, which is the world‚Äôs second-largest fashion retailer after Zara owner Inditex, had failed to meet a commitment it made in 2013 to ensure its suppliers would pay a living wage to around 850,000 textile workers by 2018.

Workers in factories which supply H&M in Cambodia earned less than half the estimated living wage, a figure which dropped to around a third for those living in India and Turkey, the CCC report stated.

Many workers overtime hours which exceeded the legal limit without being properly paid, it added.

Others were only paid the minimum wage if they worked extra hours and met their quota ‚Äì a situation the United Nations defines as forced labour, the CCC said.

‚ÄúH&M needs to take action immediately to stop the scandal of poverty wages and workers‚Äô rights violations,‚Äù said the CCC's Bettina Musiolek.

But H&M said it had reached at least 600 factories and 930,000 garment workers with its fair living wage strategy.

‚ÄãIndia is on the greatest toilet-building spree in human history,"India is on the greatest toilet-building spree in human history, and it‚Äôs a windfall for companies.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs $20bn (¬£15bn) ‚ÄúClean India‚Äù mission aims to construct 111 million latrines in five years. Besides promising to improve the health, safety and dignity of hundreds of millions of Indians, the national hygiene drive has spurred an 81 per cent jump in sales of concrete building materials and 48 per cent increase in bathroom and sanitaryware sales, according to Euromonitor International. That‚Äôs benefiting firms from Tata Group, the nation‚Äôs largest conglomerate, to cleaning products maker Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc.

Almost 80 million household toilets are estimated to have been built since Modi‚Äôs 2014 pledge to ensure universal sanitation coverage by October 2019, which will mark 150 years since the birth of independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. The scaleup of latrines and a nationwide campaign to encourage their use is driving a market for toilet-related products and services that‚Äôs predicted to double to $62bn by 2021.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the biggest, most successful behaviour-change campaign in the world,‚Äù says Val Curtis, director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine‚Äôs Environmental Health Group, who has worked on the programme in India. ‚ÄúEvery time I go there, I feel like I can‚Äôt sit down for weeks after because I‚Äôm excited about what they‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs incredible.‚Äù

Bollywood celebrity Akshay Kumar, star of the sanitation-promoting movie Toilet: Ek Prem Katha (or Toilet: A Love Story), was appointed brand ambassador this month for Harpic, the bowl cleaner made by Reckitt Benckiser. The UK-based company, which also sells the disinfectant Dettol, dominates the toilet care market in India, with sales climbing 11 per cent to $105.7m last year, Euromonitor data shows.

‚ÄúWe are one of the most trusted brands in India, and we‚Äôve always managed to outperform the market with Dettol,‚Äù Rakesh Kapoor, Reckitt Benckiser‚Äôs India-born chief executive officer, said on a conference call in April. The company has been able to increase awareness of its cleaning products by working with open defecation-free communities and households to promote sanitation and hygiene.

That‚Äôs a common theme across suppliers of homecare products, according to Sowmya Adiraju, a research analyst at Euromonitor in Bengaluru. For example, Hindustan Unilever Ltd entered the low-cost toilet cleaner market with a new powdered product, and has been trying to make toilets accessible and affordable through its Domex Toilet Academy.

Companies are investing heavily on spreading awareness about better hygiene products, aiding the penetration of homecare products in India, which is still low by global standards, Adiraju says in an email.

The ‚ÄúClean India‚Äù mission has had a ‚Äúlargely positive‚Äù impact on suppliers of sanitaryware and tiles, sales of which are predicted to expand about 11 per cent annually through 2022, according to Adiraju. The sanitation campaign was anticipated initially to provide a bigger sales boost, but some companies have partnered with governments more as a social initiative than a business opportunity, she says.

Before Modi began the Clean India programme, known locally as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan mission, the country accounted for more than half of the world‚Äôs 1.1 billion people who routinely relieve themselves in fields, beaches and other open spaces.

So-called open defecation contaminates food and drinking water, and spreads diarrheal diseases that cause chronic malnutrition and childhood stunting ‚Äì a burden the World Bank estimated costs India 6.4 per cent of its gross domestic product.

‚ÄúSanitation is a basic need that is denied to a majority of the Indian population,‚Äù says Rajeev Kher, chief executive officer of SaraPlast Pvt Ltd, a closely-held manufacturer, supplier and cleaner of restrooms, including portable toilets for rent. Kher has also converted aged buses into mobile toilets to provide a ‚Äúclean and safe toilet experience‚Äù for women in a collaboration with municipal authorities in the western city of Pune.

For individual households, Japan‚Äôs LIXIL Group has supplied tens of thousands of twin pit toilet systems that costs $10 or less apiece to facilitate the safe management of excreta in the absence of a sewage connection.

Increased government spending on toilets and sanitation augers well for Indian Hume Pipe Co, according to Pallav Agarwal, an analyst with Antique Stock Broking Ltd in Mumbai, who rates the pipe company a buy. It secured a dozen major work orders for water supply and sewerage projects across six states in the 2018 fiscal year, totalling 20.9 billion rupees (¬£228m)), Agarwal said in a 5 July report.

Shares of Cera Sanitaryware Ltd and Somany Ceramics Ltd have more than doubled since August 2014, when Modi in his Independence Day speech emphasised on hygiene and the need to build toilets in rural areas. Kajaria Ceramics Ltd and HSIL Ltd have each jumped at least 40 per cent in the period.

Mumbai-based Tata Group‚Äôs steel division makes Nest-In, a modular toilet that comes with an option for a bio-digester. The company has been focusing on products for end-users, including modular housing and toilets, and in March opened public toilet blocks at rest stops along a national highway.

‚ÄúPrivate sector enterprises have to pitch in to make the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan successful,‚Äù says Prabhat Pani, head of partnerships and technology at Tata Trusts, which owns two-thirds of Tata Sons, the apex company of Tata Group.

India riots: Patel caste seeks 'backward' status to qualify for job quotas,"Violence has erupted in the Indian state of Gujaratafter a rally by the influential Patel community, who are demanding their caste status be altered to ‚Äúbackward‚Äù in order to access quotas for government jobs and college places.

Police clashed with protesters, after around half a million people brought the main city of Ahmedabad to a standstill, calling for the Patels or Patidar caste to be considered for positions reserved for groups at the bottom of society, who have faced centuries of discrimination.

Hardik Patel, 22, the firebrand leader of the campaign, was briefly detained by police, which triggered rioting across the city and left at least three people dead.

‚ÄúThey have burnt down nine police stations and more than three dozen buses,‚Äù said the director-general of police in Gujarat. Protesters attacked both police officers and their vehicles, throwing stones and injuring at least a dozen officers, police said. The authorities imposed a curfew in parts of the state and Delhi sent security forces to try and ease tensions.

The Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, called for calm in this, his home state, which is a stronghold for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), where he ruled for more than a decade before taking office in Delhi last year. ‚ÄúI appeal to the people of Gujarat to maintain peace. Violence will never achieve anything,‚Äù he said.

In Hinduism‚Äôs rigid caste system, a person‚Äôs occupation and social position is determined by birth, meaning those on the lowest rungs can be condemned to menial work for generations.

To counter this, India now reserves up to 50 per cent of public-sector jobs and places in state education institutions for those from the lowest castes and for other traditionally disadvantaged groups collectively known as ‚Äúother backward classes‚Äù, or OBCs.

Members of the Patel community, largely affluent traders forming around 15 per cent of the population in Gujarat and a sizeable chunk of the Indian diaspora in Britain, claim they have lost out on opportunities to lower castes.

They say that so long as the quota system exists, the Patels should be reclassified as OBCs.

‚ÄúA student under reserved category with poorer grades gets admission, but a Patel does not get admission despite having secured higher grades,‚Äù said Hardik Patel in an hour-long speech to the crowds in Ahmedabad before his arrest.

‚ÄúWe want reservation to preserve our dignity and our heritage. We have the right to reservation, and so do our children.‚Äù he added, warning the ruling BJP party that his community would withdraw their support in the next state elections if their demands were not met.

Gujarat‚Äôs Chief Minister, Anandiben Patel, has ruled out adding the Patels to the list of castes benefiting from the quotas, saying the proportion of reserved government jobs and school places has already reached the 50 per cent limit imposed by the Supreme Courts.

Hardik Patel has threatened to go on hunger strike until the government relents, and has called for a strike among the Patel community, who dominate the diamond and textile industry in India.

Caste-based quotas have long been a thorny issue in Indian politics, with periodic calls for both their abolition and extension to other groups, or for the basis to shift to economic condition instead.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-riots-patel-caste-seeks-backward-status-to-qualify-for-job-quotas-10473800.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj1v8bX86roAhVWyzgGHbI8Bxs4FBAWMAR6BAgGEAI&usg=AOvVaw1yBNB-jWCJd6YWh-tU7T1x,
Why the rise of wearable tech to monitor employees is worrying,"An increasing number of companies are beginning to digitally monitor their employees. While employers have always scrutinised their workers‚Äô performance, the rise of wearable technology to keep tabs has more of a dystopian edge to it. Monitoring has become easier, more intrusive and is not just limited to the workplace ‚Äì it‚Äôs 24/7.

Devices such as Fitbit, Nike+ FuelBand and Jawbone UP, which can record information related to health, fitness, sleep quality, fatigue levels and location, are now being used by employers who integrate wearable devices into employee wellness programmes.

One of the first was BP America, which introduced Fitbit bracelets in 2013. In 2015 at least 24,500 BP‚Äôs employees were using them and more and more US employers have followed suit. For instance, the same year, Vista Staffing Solutions, a healthcare recruitment agency, started a weight-loss programme using Fitbits and wifi-enabled bathroom scales. Appirio, a consulting company, started handing out Fitbits to employees in 2014.

In the UK similar projects are under consideration by major employers. And this trend will only intensify in the years to come. By 2018, estimates suggest that more than 13m of these devices will be part of worker wellness schemes. Some analysts say that by the same year, at least 2m employees worldwide will be required to wear health-and-fitness trackers as a condition of employment.

According to some, this is a positive development. Chris Brauer, an academic at Goldsmiths, University of London, argues that corporate managers will now be comparable to football managers. They will be equipped with a dashboard of employee performance trajectories, as well as their fatigue and sleep levels. They will be able to pick only the fittest employees for important business meetings, presentations, or negotiations.

It seems, however, that such optimism overlooks important negative and potentially dangerous social consequences of using this kind of technology. History here offers a word of warning.

Historical precedent

The monitoring of workers‚Äô health outside the workplace was once attempted by the Ford Motor Company. When Ford introduced a moving assembly line in 1913 ‚Äì a revolutionary innovation that enabled complete control over the pace of work ‚Äì the increase in productivity was dramatic. But so was the rise in worker turnover. In 1913, every time the company wanted to add 100 men to its factory personnel, it was necessary to hire 963, as workers struggled to keep up with the pace and left shortly after being recruited.

Ford‚Äôs solution to this problem was to double wages. In 1914, the introduction of a US$5 a day wage was announced, which immediately led to a decline in worker turnover. But high wages came with a condition: the adoption of healthy and moral lifestyles.

The company set up a sociology department to monitor workers‚Äô ‚Äì and their families‚Äô ‚Äì compliance with its standards. Investigators would make unannounced calls upon employees and their neighbours to gather information on living conditions and lifestyles. Those that were deemed insufficiently healthy or morally right were immediately disqualified from the US$5 wage level.

Analysing Ford‚Äôs policies, Italian political philosopher and revolutionary Antonio Gramsci coined the term ‚ÄúFordism‚Äù for this social phenomenon. It signalled fundamental changes to labour, which became much more intense after automation. Monitoring workers‚Äô private lives to control their health, Gramsci argued, was necessary to preserve ‚Äúa certain psycho-physical equilibrium which prevents the physiological collapse of the worker, exhausted by the new method of production‚Äù.

Parallels today

Today, we are faced with another great change to how work is done. To begin with, the ‚Äúgreat doubling‚Äù of the global labour force has led to the increase in competition between workers around the world. This has resulted in a deterioration of working and employment conditions, the growth of informal and precarious labour, and the intensification of exploitation in the West.

So there has been a significant increase in the average number of hours worked and an increase in the intensity of labour. For example, research carried out by the Trade Union Congress in 2015 discovered that the number of people working more than 48 hours in a week in the UK was rising and it warned of a risk of ‚Äúburnout Britain‚Äù.

Indeed, employee burnouts have become a major concern of employers. A UK survey of human resources directors carried out in 2015 established that 80% were afraid of losing top employees to burnout.

Ford‚Äôs sociology department was shut down in the early 1920s for two reasons. It became too costly to maintain it in the context of increasing competition from other car manufacturers. And also because of growing employee resistance to home visits by inspectors, increasingly seen as too intrusive into their private lives.

Wearable technology, however, does not suffer from these inconveniences. It is not costly and it is much less obviously intrusive than surprise home visits by company inspectors. Employee resistance appears to be low, though there have been a few attempts to fake the results of the tracking (for example, workers strapping their employer-provided Fitbits onto their dogs to boost their ‚Äúactivity levels‚Äù). The idea of being tracked has mostly gone unchallenged.

Labour commodified to the extreme

But the use of wearable technology by employers raises a range of concerns. The most obvious is the right to privacy. The use of wearable technology goes significantly further than computer systems where emails are already logged and accessible to employers.

Surveillance becomes continuous and all-encompassing, increasingly unconfined to the workplace, and also constitutes a form of surveillance which penetrates the human body. The right to equal employment opportunities and promotion may also be compromised if employers reserve promotion for those who are in a better physical shape or suffer less from fatigue or stress.

It may also be argued that the use of wearable technology takes what the Hungarian historian Karl Polanyi called the ‚Äúcommodification‚Äù of human labour to an extreme. Monitoring worker health both inside and outside the workplace involves the treatment of people as machines whose performance is to be maximised at all costs. However, as Polanyi warned, human labour is a ‚Äúfictitious commodity‚Äù ‚Äì it is not ‚Äúproduced‚Äù for sale to capital as a mere tool. To treat it as such risks ultimately leading to a ‚Äúdemolition of society‚Äù.

To protect individual rights, systems have been introduced to regulate how data that is gathered on employees is stored and used. So one possible solution is to render the data collected by trackers compulsorily anonymous. For example, one company that collects and monitors employee data for companies, Sociometric Solutions only charts broader patterns and connections to productivity, rather than individual performance.

This, however, does not address concerns about the increasing commodification of human labour that comes with the use of wearable technology and any potential threats to society. To prevent this, it is perhaps necessary to consider imposing an outright ban on its use by employers altogether.

The time has come for us to consensually evolve a code of conduct for all political parties, a code of ethics for all individuals in public life, and a code of best practices for the government at all levels.

We must fight all anti-national and anti-social forces that try to disrupt normal life. Terrorism is a threat to our normal lives, and we must all unite in fighting it. We will fight terrorism forcefully. Let there be no doubt about it. However, we are willing to talk to any group provided they abjure the path of violence.

We have always been in favour of dialogue with Pakistan. It is our intention to carry it forward with firm resolve and sincerity. The edifice of peace must stand on the twin pillars of mutual trust and confidence. Of course, cross-border terrorism and bloodshed can make our task more difficult and complex.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/manmohan-singh-violence-could-hinder-india-pakistan-peace-efforts-556732.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwj1v8bX86roAhVWyzgGHbI8Bxs4FBAWMAl6BAgDEAI&usg=AOvVaw3jLt79Ra_vvCePIP5vRBBE,
"The Bloodstone Papers, by Glen Duncan","Anglo-Indians are an obscure minority. In the hierarchy of the Raj, they perched midway between the British and the Indians. The British declined to mix with their mixed-race offspring, while the Anglo-Indians, in turn, remained resolutely aloof from the Indians.

The privileges of ""cheechees"" included reserved employment: on the Indian Railways and in the Post Office. When independence arrived in 1947, their elevated status was threatened and thousands retreated to a ""fatherland"" most had never seen. Glen Duncan's novel deals with one, Ross Monroe, and his departure from India.

Ross is a boxer who hopes his pugilistic skills will secure his family a place on the boat. His tale is narrated in present-day London by his son, Owen, writing a novel based around his father's recollections. Another link to the past is Owen's efforts to trace his father's old enemy Skinner, a debonair Englishman who Ross believes betrayed him. Meanwhile, in contrast to Ross's youthful quest to secure a future, Owen is staring into the void of mid-life. He supports himself by teaching, bar work and penning classy pornography, all distractions from pining for his lost soulmate, Scarlet.

There are a number of achievements here. Where a lesser writer could flounder into self-indulgence with a novel-within-a-novel structure, Duncan crafts it to seem naturalistic. In the process, he enters the heads of Ross, Owen and Kate - Ross's wife - and inhabits them with profound characterisations. We also share Ross's ambivalent emotions in the boxing ring. External reality vanishes as he dances sensuously with his opponents, all the while searching coldly for opportunities to batter them unconscious.

Duncan is equally adept at rendering the bathos of Owen's relations with women. Romantic illusions have dissipated and Owen is acutely sensitive to the awkwardness of every fresh alliance. Nonetheless, Owen finds wry comedy in his physical decline.

Duncan's historical research, too, has produced flawless results: I can vouch for that, because my mother is Anglo-Indian. A myriad of fine detail captures this forgotten race: their blinkered sentimentality, unwavering Christian faith and easy affinity with all things Indian - other than, sadly, the Indians themselves. Crucially, there is the corrosive insecurity of entrapment between alien cultures. The Bloodstone Papers is Duncan's sixth novel and marks his coming-of-age as one of our finest writers.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-bloodstone-papers-by-glen-duncan-6097601.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjHjaf086roAhVmyDgGHehrAnM4HhAWMAJ6BAgGEAI&usg=AOvVaw1NKKgyVYMaHt6LUP0vFpvT,
India's shining lights cast shadow but the Championship still matters,"Never can the country's professional cricketers, whose employment begins in earnest this morning with the start of the County Championship, have entered a season surrounded by so much uncertainty. Dressing-room conversation during pre-season training will have been dominated by the hyperbole generated by the Indian Premier League, the millions of dollars sloshing around in it, and the ramifications the 20-over tournament will have on the future cricket they play and the careers they have. A few will undoubtedly be questioning the worthiness of the six-month journey they are about to embark on.

Every last one of them would ultimately like to get a slice of the lucre on offer. To some the lure may act as a huge spur, an incentive to go on and perform great deeds. Most, however, will quickly realise that it is not they who will become rich fast playing for the Chennai Super Kings. That, sadly, is already the exclusive territory of those without mortgages.

In comparison to the IPL, which begins under lights in front of 55,000 fans in Bangalore on Friday, a visit to The Oval, where Surrey take on Lancashire, does seem a wee bit low-key, even though it is likely to herald Andrew Flintoff's much-awaited comeback. Indeed, the match-up has led many to question whether domestic cricket's most important competition will still be around in five years' time.

But it will be and, for the future of cricket, it needs to be. The County Championship would not know what to do with itself if it were to be given positive publicity at the start of a season. At the weekend it was aptly compared to a cockroach and, unlike its more glamorous brothers, it continually proves its resilience and is extremely difficult to remove.

Its format will inevitably change and that is no bad thing. Sixteen four-day games is too many. Ten plus semi-finals and a grand final, a scenario that would be created by three leagues of six, would suffice. The Pro40 could easily be dispensed with, too. It has a structure that would create space for the imminent arrival of an extended or new Twenty20 League. Whatever changes the England and Wales Cricket Board makes need to be thought through to ensure that they are right both in the short and long term.

Many commentators seem to think that English cricket can just flick its fingers and replicate what is taking place in India. This is rubbish. For cricket India is a unique playground and English cricket, like the sport in every other country in the world, may have to accept that it cannot compete financially with India.

The crowds may be small and the whole process unprofitable but it is vital that first-class ‚Äì four day ‚Äì cricket continues to be played. It was in front of several hundred spectators at Grace Road that Ryan Sidebottom learnt to bowl line and length and Kevin Pietersen honed his skills. Without such experience the quality of cricket around the world would fall rapidly. Like root disease in a tree it would eventually result in the whole game falling to the ground. The Championship still matters too. At a pre-season launch Robert Key, Kent's victorious Twenty20 captain last season, said it was the County Championship he wanted to win most, proof that greater investment of time and effort brings greater satisfaction.

It is ironic that the season should start under such shadow because 2007 produced one of the most exciting Championship run-ins ever, with Sussex pipping Lancashire in the final hour of the final day. It will be these two sides, along with possibly Durham and Surrey, who push for the title this summer. The IPL has removed many of the big overseas stars from county squads and this will, hopefully, encourage England-qualified players to take responsibility for winning matches and not leave it to foreigners.

Most early-season attention will follow the rehabilitation of Flintoff, with everyone hoping he fully recovers from a chronic ankle injury and returns to England duty. His presence would give Michael Vaughan's stuttering side a needed fillip before crucial Test series against New Zealand and South Africa.

There have been several changes to the regulations and structure of the 2008 season. A day of County Championship cricket has been shortened from 104 to 96 overs. The decision was made before the launch of the IPL, when the volume of cricket played was an issue. Yet the smell of the greenback seems, miraculously, to have revitalised the players in the eyes of their union.

The structure of the Friends Provident Trophy has been changed, with the two-conference system ditched for four regional groups of five teams ‚Äì the 18 counties plus Ireland and Scotland ‚Äì who play each other home and away. The mini-leagues will be followed by quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final. The Twenty20 Cup has been extended too, with the divisional part of the tournament now consisting of 10 games rather than eight.

A highlight of the summer will be Mark Ramprakash posting his 100th first-class hundred. The Surrey run machine currently has 97 three-figure scores to his name, and it can only be a question of when he becomes the 25th player in the history of the game to reach the landmark. Ramprakash's England career may have been a frustration but this will be some achievement.

In 20 years' time Twenty20 fifties could be treated with the same reverence. Scary, isn't it?

Who's hot and who's not: County by County guide to 2008 season

First division

Durham

Captain Dale Benkenstein.

Overseas Neil McKenzie (until June), Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Albie Morkel (T20).

Durham began the final day of last season on top of the Championship and are capable of finishing this one looking down on the rest. With Steve Harmison having much to prove in a potent seam attack wickets will not be a problem, although spin remains a weakness. Runs should come from Benkenstein, Chanderpaul and the now ""Kolpaked"" Michael di Venuto.

One to watch Kyle Coetzer, who should profit from batting experience around him.

Major ins N McKenzie, L Goddard, A Morkel, M Stoneman.

Major outs N Peng, O Gibson, S Styris

Last season Second, First Division; Pro40 winners; Friends Provident Trophy winners.

Hampshire

Captain Dimitri Mascarenhas.

Overseas Shane Bond, Shane Watson (T20).

There is an air of ""after the Shane Warne show"" pervading the Rose Bowl, with the departure of the legendary Australia spin bowler for the riches of India. And with their new captain otherwise engaged with the IPL for the season's opening salvoes and the England batsman Kevin Pietersen a rare sighting for the county, making sure they remain in the top flight is priority No 1.

One to watch David Balcombe, another product of Durham University whose batting has already impressed opponents.

In S Bond.

Out J Bruce, S Udal, S Warne.

Last season Fifth, First Division; Friends Provident Trophy runners-up.

Kent

Captain Rob Key.

Overseas Yasir Arafat.

Should have enough going for them to add another season to their record of being the only county to have featured in First Division of the Championship from day one. Plenty of batting from their dependable captain Key down. Amjad Khan's return from injury will add some much-needed oomph to the attack, while Azhar Mahmood and Pakistan's Arafat are decent signings and should do likewise.

One to watch Sam Northeast. The 18-year-old should one day turn junior England caps into the real thing.

In A Mahmood, S Northeast.

Out A Hall, M Patel.

Last season Seventh, First Division; Twenty20 winners

Lancashire

Captain Stuart Law.

Overseas Brad Hodge.

The county's notorious Championship title drought is now into its 74th year. Another 25 runs on that breathless final evening of the season at The Oval last year and a first outright title since 1934 would have been on the way to Old Trafford. The squad are much the same but with Law now at the helm in place of Mark Chilton. They will not be far away from the top of the table again... weather permitting.

One to watch Francois du Plessis, a Kolpak signing who is one of South Africa's brightest talents.

In F du Plessis.

Out M Muralitharan.

Last season Third, First Division; Twenty20 semi-finalists.

Nottinghamshire

Captain Chris Read.

Overseas Adam Voges (until June), David Hussey.

Steve Harmison will not be popular around Trent Bridge after his failure for England this winter opened the Test door for Stuart Broad and now Nottinghamshire face the prospect of relying largely on TV to catch a glimpse of their two strike bowlers (Ryan Sidebottom is the other). Conjuring 20 wickets will be a challenge for Read as the Championship's yo-yo side seek to re-establish themselves in the top flight.

One to watch Alex Hales, 18-year-old, 6ft 5in right-hander who has scored heavily for the second XI.

In S Broad, M Wood, D Pattinson.

Out D Alleyne, S Fleming, J Gallian.

Last season Second, Second Division.

Somerset

Captain Justin Langer.

Overseas Langer.

There will be no shortage of self-belief at Taunton with Langer at the helm. With the former England batsman Marcus Trescothick's future sorted, the blossoming talents of James Hildreth and plenty of all-round back-up, hefty totals should not be a problem. But can Andrew Caddick, 40 this year, continue to carry the attack against the stronger line-ups of the First Division?

One to watch Craig Kieswetter, the South African-born 20-year-old. This wicketkeeper-batsman has one-day international potential.

In O Banks.

Out G Andrew, M Wood, C White.

Last year First, Second Division; promoted from Pro40 Second Division.

Surrey

Captain Mark Butcher.

Overseas Matt Nicholson.

Pedro Collins turned his back on West Indies to join Surrey as one of the ubiquitous Kolpaks. The county had stated their resistance to bringing in such recruits, but needs must and Surrey's bowling needs reinforcing. Not so when it comes to runs and that's down to the relentless Mark Ramprakash. Butcher has an experienced squad who should continue to sit comfortably in midtable.

One to watch Chris Jordan, 19-year-old all-rounder from Barbados who could play for England or West Indies.

In U Afzaal, P Collins, S Mushtaq.

Out I Salisbury, R Clarke, R Hamilton-Brown, M Akram.

Last year Fourth, First Division.

Sussex

Captain Chris Adams.

Overseas Mushtaq Ahmed.

A last hurrah for Adams? To make it four titles in six years he will have to replace Rana Naved's 50 wickets and Richard Montgomerie's 1,000 runs. The attack appears creaky, although the Anglo-Aussie Ryan Harris is an interesting prospect and Mushtaq is still dangerous, but runs should flow and this is a team who know how to win.

One to watch Rory Hamilton-Brown, a former England Under-19 batsman who left Surrey in search of a first-team place.

In R Aga, R Hamilton-Brown, W Beer, R Harris.

Out S Mushtaq, R Naved-ul-Hasan, R Montgomerie.

Last year First, First Division.

Yorkshire

Captain Darren Gough.

Overseas Morne Morkel. (until June), Naved-ul-Hasan.

With Gough's unwavering enthusiasm another flying start is likely, but can they sustain it this time around? Sound overseas signings should ensure a steady supply of wickets, especially with the prospect of seeing more of Matthew Hoggard. Jacques Rudolph needs more support with the bat, which the return of Chris Taylor may provide.

One to watch Adil Rashid, a big season for the 20-year-old. Genuine leg-spinning all-rounders don't come around very often, hence the expectation.

In M Morkel, C Taylor, G Ballance.

Out M Wood, N Thornicroft.

Last year Sixth, First Division.

Second division

Derbyshire

Captain Rikki Clarke.

Overseas Chris Rogers.

Clarke takes over a young squad at a club determined to revitalise itself after years of dour failure. Mahela Jayawardene's preference for the riches of the IPL instead of the cheaper charms of the Racecourse Ground leaves a large hole in the batting that Rogers, who made his Australia Test debut this winter, will do well to fill.

One to watch Dominic Tello, 22-year-old South African batsman taking the Kolpak route in hope of an England future.

In R Clarke, N Doshi, M Jayawardene, C Rogers, J Sadler, D Tello.

Out G Ballance, B Rankin, C Taylor, H Adnan.

Last season Sixth, Second Division.

Essex

Captain Mark Pettini.

Overseas Andre Nel (until May), Danish Kaneria.

Pettini lost his touch when he replaced Ronnie Irani as captain last season. If his first full campaign is to prove a success, he must find it again. Have batting depth, but bowling looks light, although David Masters' arrival from Leicestershire may bolster the seam attack. Promotion not beyond them and have one-day potential.

One to watch Varun Chopra, 20-year-old opener, of whom Graham Gooch likes the look. Enough said.

In C Wright, D Masters, J Gallian.

Out D Thomas, R Irani, A McGarry, A Bichel.

Last season Fourth, Second Division.

Glamorgan

Captain David Hemp.

Overseas Jason Gillespie.

Last season was a horror story: two wins in 41 games in all competitions. But there is hope: a dusting of young talent, led by the precocious all-round abilities of 17-year-old James Harris (who will miss the first part of the season doing his A-levels) and the arrival of Jamie Dalrymple and the former Australia bowler Gillespie. A summer of small steps is surely the best that can be hoped for.

One to watch Tom Maynard, 18-year-old batsman who is showing signs of being a chip off the old Maynard block.

In J Dalrymple, M Wood, A Shantry.

Out S Jones, A Davies, N Peng, D Cherry, M Elliott, A Harrison.

Last season Ninth, Second Division.

Gloucestershire

Captain Jon Lewis.

Overseas Marcus North.

For the first time in over two decades there will be no Mark Alleyne presiding at Nevill Road. Instead there's Jack Russell, the former England wicketkeeper who, with all his accompanying quirks, tea bags and Weetabix, does not appear an obvious choice as an off-field mentor as the county search for a coach. But then Gloucestershire have often done things differently.

One to watch Vikram Banerjee, slow left-armer who took 42 wickets in his first full season last time out.

In W Porterfield.

Out U Gul.

Last season Seventh, Second Division; Twenty20 runners-up.

Leicestershire

Captain Paul Nixon.

Overseas Boeta Dippenaar.

It's all change at Grace Road, as promised by the coach, Tim Boon, who has done his best to ensure his new overseas signing finds a home from home. There are four more South Africans jostling for dressing-room space ‚Äì add another Kolpak in the West Indian Jermaine Lawson and it does not say much for the club's promise to provide places for home-grown talent.

One to watch James Taylor, England Under-19 batsman who has joined from Worcestershire.

In D du Preez, J du Toit, G Kruger, N Malik, J Lawson.

Out S Broad, D Masters, D Robinson, J Maunders, D Stiff, J Sadler, N Walker.

Last season Eighth, Second Division.

Middlesex

Captain Ed Smith.

Overseas Vernon Philander (until June), Murali Kartik.

Some decent youngsters and enduring old 'uns make for a squad who have the ability to compete for promotion. Kartik is a good overseas player, but it must be hoped the Kolpak contingent don't get in the way of some able home-grown talent.

One to watch Steve Finn. At 6ft 8in it would be difficult to miss the 19-year-old fast bowler. An outstanding prospect, provided his frame can take the strain.

In F de Wet, S Udal, G Berg, K Toor, V Philander, D Nannes.

Out J Dalrymple, B Hutton, C Whelan, R Johnson, C Keegan, C Vaas, C Wright.

Last season Third, Second Division; promoted from Pro40 Second Division.

Northamptonshire

Captain Nicky Boje.

Overseas Johann Louw.

Boje has a tough job on his hands, but then the South African is a tough character. Nevertheless, there appears little obvious prospect of an improvement on last season's featureless campaign. The persistently admirable David Sales, who tops the county's averages in recent times, will be leant on heavily as ever to provide the runs.

One to watch Alex Wakely, the England Under-19 captain, has been compared to Greg Chappell in style.

In N Boje, J Louw.

Out U Afzaal, R Dawson, C Rogers.

Last season Fifth, Second Division; relegated from Pro40 First Division.

Warwickshire

Captain Darren Maddy.

Overseas Monde Zondeki. (Sanath Jayasuriya, T20).

Post-double relegation clear-out brought in new coaching set-up of Ashley Giles and Allan Donald. After a pre-season that included a spell in an army barracks, a counter-attack beckons. Much will depend on Zondeki firing and Maddy chipping in with key runs and wickets.

One to watch Nicholas James, the new Giles? A 21-year-old slow left-armer with all-round pretensions.

In B Rankin, I Salisbury, R Johnson.

Out V van Jaarsveld, H Streak, A Giles, A Loudon, A Shantry, D Brown, P Harris, D Steyn, K Sangakkara.

Last year Eighth, First Division; relegated from Pro40 First Division.

Worcestershire

Captain Vikram Solanki.

Overseas Steve Magoffin (until July), Fidel Edwards.

Will the real Simon Jones stand up (if he can)? Jones claims to be fit and raring to go and his new county need him to be after relegation. A potential new-ball pairing of Jones and Edwards offers real menace, while Graeme Hick, all 41 years and 134 centuries, will provide the runs to give weight to a promotion challenge.

One to watch Alexei Kervezee, 18-year-old Dutchman touted as the new Hick, so no pressure then.

In G Andrew, S Jones, C Whelan, M Ahmed, D Wheeldon, O Ali.

Out D Bollinger, R Sillence, D Nel, R Price, N Malik, P Jaques.

Last year Ninth, First Division.

Deaf aid worker appeals over drug sentence,"A charity worker feted in India for setting up a foundation for the deaf is to appeal against a 10-year jail term for drug possession.

Ian Stillman is also deaf and has an artificial leg but he has been forced to sleep on a concrete floor in cramped conditions and his family say his health is deteriorating.

He was sentenced earlier this month after being arrested last year with a 20 kilogram bag of cannabis in the foothills of the Himalayas at Manali, a popular staging post for mountain trekkers.

His taxi was stopped at a roadblock after visiting a friend and police claimed to have found the cannabis in the car. Mr Stillman said he had never seen it before.

In 1978 Mr Stillman, originally from Reading, Berkshire, set up the Nambikkai Foundation, which provides training, employment and education for deaf people in India. He is also an adviser to the Indian government on deaf issues.

His brother-in-law, Jerry Dugdale, said Mr Stillman's trial was unjust and he should be freed. ""We make this submission in the light of Ian's international reputation and his sacrifice for the deaf of India, of whom he is one,"" he said.

Stephen Jakobi, of campaign group Fair Trials Abroad, said: ""This is a man who is known around the world for his work and it is unbelievable what has happened to him.""",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/deaf-aid-worker-appeals-over-drug-sentence-9269238.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjHjaf086roAhVmyDgGHehrAnM4HhAWMAd6BAgCEAI&usg=AOvVaw0Aad-iwOJxrqO4B_OhAyzD,
Why international business graduates are an asset to any global organisation,"Why does Coca-Cola taste different in different countries? Why have big British companies located their call centres in India? Why do Hollywood films have different endings in the US compared to the UK? These are just some of the questions which a degree in international business could help you find the answers to.

As international travel and communications become easier, businesses are increasingly choosing to locate parts of their company wherever is best for them. Sometimes companies relocate to somewhere where it is cheaper to produce their goods; other times, they move closer to their international markets. For example, a great deal of the world's manufacturing is now done in the Far East as the cost of production is much lower there.

Companies need employees who know how to work in this globalised business world. Many universities and colleges recognise this need for graduates with international experience and offer degree programmes for people who wish to work in organisations that trade around the world. International business programmes offer students the opportunity to study how businesses work across national boundaries, taking into account the potential advantages and problems that this can result in.

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

But how is an international business degree different to an ordinary business programme? Well, studying international business will give you the opportunity to travel overseas, learn about different cultures and ways of doing business, learn languages and study business on both a global and local level. You will study all aspects of business, marketing, human resource management, finance and operations, but with an international business perspective in mind.

You will usually be expected to spend at least one year overseas during your programme and perhaps two. This might be a study exchange or a work placement, or a combination of both. If you'd like to visit a particular country during your studies, check with your chosen university or college to see if they have exchange partners or work placement opportunities in that country.

An international business degree is ideal if you like travelling, are interested in languages and cultures and are keen to work in a business that operates on a global scale. You will need to be confident about travelling alone and have an open-minded and independent attitude.

Whatever you are studying at A-level or AVCE, there is likely to be an international business programme for you. Some universities and colleges prefer you to be studying business or economics and a language, but others may accept you whatever you are studying. Check prospectuses for details of specific institutions' entry requirements. Then, when writing your personal statement in your UCAS application, show that you are interested in travel, that you are confident about living and working overseas, and that you are genuinely interested in global businesses.

International business graduates have the world at their feet! If you have a degree which has given you experience of travelling, living, studying or working overseas, language skills and an understanding of how global businesses and markets operate, you are a valuable asset to any company. Graduates go on to work in a range of roles too. You might work in international marketing, become a manager for a regional operation of a large company, or even set up your own business. Those with language skills are in high demand amongst employers and with your experience of living independently overseas, you will have demonstrated many of the skills companies are looking for.

So, if you love to travel and are interested in a high-flying job in a major company, a degree in international business might just be right for you.

A flavour of France

Thomas Smith, 20, studied at The Brunts Sixth Form, Mansfield. He has A-levels in business studies (A), geography (A) and ICT (B). Smith is now studying international business at the University of Hertfordshire (3rd year)

""During my A-level business studies course, I always found the international aspects of world business the most appealing. Therefore, I decided to opt for international business as opposed to a standard business degree in order to differentiate myself from future employment competition.

After research into the various programs offered at different universities, I decided that the course at the University of Hertfordshire was the right choice for me. The business school was ranked and after touring the university, I discovered that I would have access to exceptional resources.

To develop my language skills, I wanted a degree that would enable me to travel as well as providing me with valuable work experience. My first year was based in the UK, followed by a year of study in French at the University of Quebec in Montreal, Canada. Currently, I am on a work experience placement in the European headquarters of Merial, a world leading animal health company in Lyon, France.

Studying international business has enabled me to develop a wider understanding of the business world, gaining different perspectives from the UK, North America and continental Europe.""

The 'Tampon King' who sparked a period of change for India's women,"When Arunachalam Muruganantham spotted his wife gathering dirty rags in their home one day he asked her what they were for. If he was shocked by her reluctant response ‚Äì that she was using them for her monthly period ‚Äì he was even more taken back by her reply when he asked why she was not buying sanitary napkins in the shop. ""If I buy sanitary napkins,"" she had told him. ""It means I cannot afford to buy milk for the family.""

The conversation spurred Mr Muruganantham into a frenzy of invention to try and produce an affordable napkin for women such as his wife. Such was his dedication, bordering on obsession, that he once wore a football bladder of animal blood to trial a prototype. He was forced from his home by villagers who thought his methods had become too perverse after he started collecting used napkins from medical students and storing them in his home. He was even abandoned ‚Äì albeit temporarily ‚Äì by his wife and mother, who believed he had gone mad.

But 14 years later, the 49-year-old, who never finished school, has few regrets. His award-winning napkins are being produced on simple machines by groups across rural India and helping to revolutionise women's health.

And now, the man who has been dubbed the ""Tampon King"" says he is in discussion with several African countries about replicating his model.

""Rwanda, Nigeria, South Africa ‚Äì I am talking with these countries,"" said Mr Muruganantham, speaking from Coimbatore in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu Kerala. ""Nepal, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Pakistan‚Ä¶ They want to know about it.""

One workshop in India is operated in a shed in the Pardada Pardadi Inter-College, a forward-thinking girls' school run by an NGO in the town of Anupshahr, next to the Ganges river in the state of Uttar Pradesh.

Here, Rama Devi, spends the first week of every month with six local women in the top-floor workshop, using simple hand-operated machines and following the five-step system that produces the sanitary napkins sold and distributed under the label Laadli, or ""Beloved Daughter"".

The remainder of the month she travels to villages, meeting young women, educating them about basic health issues and selling the products.

On a recent morning, The Independent accompanied Ms Devi, a single mother with four daughters, and the family's sole earner, to the village of Dungra Jogi.

Shaded from the sun beneath a large archway, one of them, 25-year-old Umar Parthak, said of the napkins: ""We feel a lot more freedom. It gives us a lot more freedom to go out. Also, the rags that we previously used were not hygienic.""

Her cousin, Sapna Sharma, who is studying sociology at a nearby college and who wishes to eventually train as a teacher, said women's education was improving, slowly. ""As a result people are becoming aware of these products,"" she added.

In some parts of rural India, as in many places in the developing world, the issue of women's menstruation is a matter still associated with taboo and discrimination. In some communities, women are still considered ""unclean"" during menstruation and are forbidden from entering the kitchen.

Professor Ritu Priya Mehrotra, of the social medicine department of Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, said women had traditionally used old cotton for menstrual hygiene. But a shift from cotton to synthetic saris meant many were now using man-made fibre, which was unhealthy and could not be sanitised in the same way. Previously women used sand or even mud.

The development of the napkin had involved huge amounts of trial and error, and one of the biggest challenges was discovering the raw material. Mr Muruganantham had assumed they were based on cotton but an early prototype by his tolerant wife was unsuccessful.

Eventually, having taught himself English, he simply rang up the switchboard of a US-based multinational and asked to know what raw materials he would need. The crucial ingredient was wood pulp.

In 2005, his seven years of effort was recognised when he was handed a National Innovation Foundation award by President Pratibha Patil. He then quickly patented his machine, which costs between ¬£850 and ¬£3,400 and is capable of producing 120 pads an hour. While companies such as Procter & Gamble produce napkins that sell for up to 30 rupees (33p) a packet, his are sold for as little as 10 rupees.

The model is deliberately low-tech and decentralised, providing employment opportunities for women in remote parts of India. ""The benefit of the local production model means that women can form co-operatives and generate some income as well. It is circular,"" Prof Mehrotra said.

As part of a broader programme to try to educate women about health issues, the Indian authorities announced last year they would start distributing subsidised napkins. The move, which is part of the so-called National Rural Health Mission, emphasised that use of such napkins could reduce reproductive tract infections that posed a grave threat to women.

Making them available in schools and colleges, such as the Pardada Pardadi Inter-College, also encourages young girls to keep up their attendance. Ms Devi, who started working in the school kitchen before graduating to the napkin production unit, said: ""I am trying to change the way the women think.""

Mr Muruganantham was disappointed the Indian government did not decide to support his low-cost machine as part of its national programme, but is pleased that foreign countries may soon benefit from it. He said: ""What I am trying to do is develop a low-cost model across the globe.""",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-tampon-king-who-sparked-a-period-of-change-for-indias-women-7897093.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjx5M6L9KroAhXkyzgGHSpsBaY4KBAWMAR6BAgFEAI&usg=AOvVaw2uFem1b9fOeMZsTTh7qcMk,
"Indian unemployment levels at 45-year high, leaked figures reveal","Unemployment in India has reached a 45-year high, according to leaked official jobs figures that the government had delayed publishing with just a few months to go until a general election.

With jobs creation one of the key pledges that delivered prime minister Narendra Modi to power in 2014, the report that the unemployment rate stands at 6.1 per cent ‚Äì the highest since 1972-73 ‚Äì could prove a damaging blow.

The figures, reported by the Business Standard, come after two senior officials in the National Statistical Commission quit their jobs over what they said was deliberate interference by government agencies to delay publication of the numbers.

The unemployment survey covers July 2017 to June 2018 and the results should have been published in December. Statistics ministry officials said the report was submitted on time, but that it was up to the government to decide when it should be released.

Official figures state that India‚Äôs GDP has grown by an impressive 7 per cent or more each year under Mr Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the highest rate of any major economy.

But the figures show new jobs are not keeping up with the pace. The Business Standard report said joblessness stood at 7.8 per cent in urban areas compared with 5.3 per cent in the countryside.

Amid growing public protests over jobs, critics have said the government‚Äôs claims of economic success have sounded increasingly hollow.

And the new figures are particularly significant as the first since Mr Modi‚Äôs decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country‚Äôs banknotes from circulation overnight. While millions of Indians were brought into the banking system for the first time, figures show demonetisation did little to claw back black money ‚Äì the main expressed aim ‚Äì while most experts say it hurt GDP.

The government declined to confirm or deny the report. Pravin Srivastava, India‚Äôs chief statistician, told Reuters: ‚ÄúWe have not released the report. I do not want to comment on it.‚Äù

Earlier this week, acting chair of the National Statistical Commission PC Mohanan and a colleague resigned, with Mr Mohanan telling India Today the commission ‚Äì which is supposed to provide oversight of official figures ‚Äì was ‚Äúbeing sidelined‚Äù.

The last report published by the statistics ministry had shown that the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 per cent in 2015-16 from 4.9 per cent in the previous year and 4.0 per cent in 2012-13.

Pronab Sen, a former chief statistician of India, said unemployment had been rising since 2012 but attempts to suppress the publication of data were not the answer.

‚ÄúIt will only create more suspicion about the intentions of the government,‚Äù he said.

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the main opposition Congress party, said the figures exposed a ‚Äúnational disaster‚Äù on Mr Modi‚Äôs watch, who he referred to as ‚Äúthe Fuhrer‚Äù.

The BJP hit back on Twitter, comparing Mr Gandhi to ‚ÄúMussolini‚Äôs shortsightedness‚Äù and saying that ‚ÄúEPFO‚Äôs real data shows sharp increase in jobs, created in just the last 15 months‚Äù. Economists have previously detailed why using numbers from the EPFO ‚Äì the state retirement fund body ‚Äì can be problematic.

The economy is currently top of the news agenda in India, with Mr Modi‚Äôs government set to issue its last budget before the election on Friday. Attempting to cease back the media narrative, it released its own figures on Thursday revising up a GDP growth estimate for 2017-18 to 7.2 per cent, from 6.7 per cent.

Nonetheless, in an editorial, the Indian Express urged the government to avoid taking ‚Äúan adversarial stance when confronted with datasets that are uncharitable regarding its performance‚Äù.

‚ÄúRepeated interventions in data releases run the risk of denting the market‚Äôs trust in official data released by government agencies,‚Äù it warned. ‚ÄúThis is a lesson China has learnt the hard way.‚Äù

Poor comparisons and rich ironies,"IN THE week the Copenhagen beanfeast debated solutions to the problem of world poverty, an interesting and modest report on our native poor was published in Britain. Modest, because the principal expense was a couple of airfares as opposed to the estimated ¬£40m cost of the UN's conference; interesting, because its two authors live in south India. By coming to the sad and impoverished housing estates of Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow, they reversed the usual traffic whereby the citizens of rich countries pontificate on the plight of the citizens of poor ones. What Stan and Mari Thekaekara found in Easterhouse and Moss Side amazed and horrified them. Their residents were financially better off than the Indian poor, but the degree of defeat and demoralisation (especially among men) was much higher.

As to causes and solutions, their report can satisfy both left and right. On the one hand: ""We have seasonal employment, under employment. But not 20 years of a purposeless, meaningless existence."" And on the other: ""The poor in Britain seemed better off ... but [without state benefits] they'd be worse off than the poorest of our poor. In India people still take the initiative.""

The Thekaekaras are not the first Indians to study the British poor. In 1842 Dwarkanath Tagore, a Calcutta entrepreneur, came to Glasgow and noted: ""At present, some 300,000 people are out of employ, which poor devils are being roughly handled by the troops. They may talk of the starvation of the Hill Coolies of India, but I see around me still more distress."" We can quarrel about relative perceptions of poverty, its cause and cure. What seems unarguable is that we have returned to that darker time when a large section of the population could be labelled as The Poor, with its Victorian ability to evoke both compassion and fear.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/poor-comparisons-and-rich-ironies-1610876.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjx5M6L9KroAhXkyzgGHSpsBaY4KBAWMAZ6BAgDEAI&usg=AOvVaw38SraF3MC99keJvSoKXxtH,
Circuses told to stop employing children,"India's highest court ordered circuses to stop employing children yesterday and instructed the government to rescue and rehabilitate those currently working for the shows.

India's Child Labour Act bans employment of children younger than 14, but circuses were exempt until six months ago when the government amended the law. But circus owners have largely ignored the law, and now the Supreme Court is mandating that it be enforced.

India is home to the greatest number of child labourers despite efforts to address the problem through compulsory education and anti-poverty programmes. Activists say the number working in circuses could be in the thousands. They often perform the most dangerous stunts, including on the trapeze or high wires and frequently without safety nets.

The court ruled on a petition from the Indian group the Save the Childhood Movement, filed in 2006 after the group studied children in circuses and found such employment often led to child trafficking.

The study revealed that children were ill-treated, poorly paid and suffered abuse, including sexual abuse, from circus owners or managers.

""A circus company would change its name and since they move from place to place, parents of children often couldn't trace their children. People were operating child-trafficking rings under the garb of a circus,"" Bhuvan Ribhu, a lawyer working for the group, said.",https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&cx=006663403660930254993:oxhge2zf1ro&q=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/circuses-told-to-stop-employing-children-2269645.html&sa=U&ved=2ahUKEwjx5M6L9KroAhXkyzgGHSpsBaY4KBAWMAh6BAgGEAI&usg=AOvVaw2IFgt6gMd_vX3w8aYsg17z,
Without consent: how drugs companies exploit Indian 'guinea pigs',"Western pharmaceutical companies have seized on India over the past five years as a testing ground for drugs ‚Äì making the most of a huge population and loose regulations which help dramatically cut research costs for lucrative products to be sold in the West. The relationship is so exploitative that some believe it represents a new colonialism.

Since restrictions on drug trials were relaxed in 2005, the industry in India has swollen to the point where today more than 150,000 people are involved in at least 1,600 clinical trials, conducted on behalf of British, American and European firms including AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck. There may be more.

While there is no official figure, some estimates suggest the industry may be worth as much as ¬£189m. Regulators have struggled to keep pace with the explosion. Between 2007 and 2010, at least 1,730 people died in India while, or after, participating in such trials. Many of those people, often only eligible for the studies because they were ill, might have died anyway. Yet when there are complications, even those resulting in deaths, there is often a failure properly to investigate.

Campaigners say the industry is wide open to other abuses. While there is no doubt many crucial trials are carried out according to the appropriate guidelines, activists say a lack of oversight has led to numerous situations where poor, sometimes illiterate individuals, recruited from city slums or else tribal communities, are used in the trials without giving proper informed consent ‚Äì that is, without fully understanding what they are signing up for. Alongside this, a new industry providing participants for these studies has been spawned and is making considerable profits.

Among some of the incidents confirmed by aninvestigation carried out by The Independent in the states of Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, as well as in Delhi and London, were:

* The recruitment of hundreds of tribal girls without parental consent for an immunisation study sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on the nod of the warden of their government hostel. Several girls subsequently died. The study was halted by the federal authorities.

* The use by drug companies of survivors of the world's worst poisonous gas disaster in Bhopal as ""guinea pigs"" in at least 11 trials without proper informed consent.

* The completion by doctors at a government hospital in Indore, in central India, of dozens of private trials that a police investigation found ""violated the ethical guidelines"". The doctors who conducted the trials decided that not one of 81 cases in which a participant suffered an adverse effect was linked to the treatment. New trials were stopped while the state government investigated. A whistle-blower was fired.

India is just one of many developing countries used by leading Western pharmaceutical companies, which spent ¬£40bn in 2010 on research and development. Globally, it is estimated around 120,000 trials are taking place in 178 countries.

Companies can reduce their research costs by an estimated 60 per cent by outsourcing the work. China, Indonesia and Thailand are among the countries which have also seen the incidence of trials soar in recent years. A quarter of all clinical data submitted to European drug regulators to secure market approval for a new drug has been obtained from trials in low- and middle-income countries. Confidential data from drug companies suggests this has recently increased to closer to 50 per cent.

Campaigners say India is a particularly attractive location for researchers not simply because of the lax regulations but because of the size and genetic diversity of the 1.2 billion population and becuase of the variety of conditions to treat. Added to this, almost all doctors speak some English. The infrastructure for such trials, often in the form of government hospitals, is widely available.

The loosening of regulations did away with a measure that had been put in place for the protection of trial subjects. Previously, for a phase three trial of a drug (when it is given to a larger sample of individuals) to be carried out in India, that phase of the trial had already to be have been completed elsewhere. Now they can run concurrently.

A comprehensive picture of the situation regarding drug trials in India following the 2005 amendment to the Drugs and Cosmetics Act is not available because of a lack of transparency and because various agencies are involved in the monitoring of the situation. Instead, much of the information has been gathered by unpaid activists using the country's Right to Information Act.

Much of the data has been collated by Dr Chandra Gulhati, a retired physician who edits the Indian Monthly Index of Medical Specialties, and who pulls together information from across the country on trials going back more than a decade. In his office in Delhi, Dr Gulhati described how lack of oversight and vested interests had created an environment in which many leading institutions had been involved in trials that breached national and international guidelines.

Dr Gulhati said figures released by the authorities suggested around 1,730 people had died following their participation in trials between January 2007 and December 2010. Whether all of these died directly as a result of the trial is unclear; many of those who participated may already have been severely ill and would have died anyway. He claimed there was an absence of clarity because it was left primarily to the doctors overseeing the trial, the ethics committee and the drug companies themselves to determine whether there was a link.

Earlier this year India's Health Minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, told parliament that a total of 10 foreign drug companies had made payments to the relatives of 22 individuals who had died during or following trials in 2010. The payments came to an average of just 238,000 rupees, or ¬£3,000, for each individual. ""Indians are being used by companies to make money selling expensive medicines in the West,"" claimed Dr Gulhati. ""[They are] using illiterate and poor Indians who will never be able to afford these kinds of medicines.""

The companies who made the compensation payments were: Pfizer, PPD, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Amgen, Bayer, Eli Lilly, Quintiles, Merck KGaA, Sanofi-Aventis and Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer. When contacted, most of the companies declined to provide details of the compensation, other than to say the figure had been agreed in conjunction with a supposedly independent ethics committee and the Drug Controller General of India.

A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly also explained that payments totalling ¬£6,340 had been made to the relatives of three individuals who died while participating in a trial of Pemetrexed, an anti-cancer drug. All three were in the advanced stages of cancer. ""The causes of death were from known drug-related side effects which were already listed in the package insert,"" said Dr Anurita Majumdar, a medical adviser to the company. ""These events do not lead to death in all patients but can get compounded in certain patients who have poor general condition and nutritional status."" Ms Majumdar added: ""We were not advised by regulators to stop the trials.""

Drug companies insist they always adhere to regulations. In a statement, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said: ""In order for a pharmaceutical company to gain a licence in the UK for a newly developed medicine, the clinical trials, wherever they took place, are subject to a high level of scrutiny by the UK regulatory authorities. It would be of no benefit to companies to conduct clinical trials that were not of the required standard, as any medicine would not gain a licence and not be made available to patients.""

While the Indian media has often focused on deaths that have resulted from trials, campaigners say perhaps a bigger issue is the routine exploitation of those who participate in them ‚Äì individuals who are often poor, ill-educated and unable to read and write.

Many participants said in interviews that they agreed to take part simply because of the recommendation of their doctor, who was very often the person conducting the trials. Since many of those selected to take part are from some of the very poorest communities, individuals have little possibility of redress.

Dr Anand Rai, a former doctor-turned-whistle-blower in the city of Indore, said many of the people recruited for trials at the city's Maharaja Yeshwantrao hospital were from the tribal community.

""There are ethical violations at every level,"" said Ms N Sarojini, director of the Sama resource group for women, which recently held a forum on clinical trials. ""There is a lack of accountability, a lack of monitoring and regulation.""

International guidelines have been formulated to protect the rights of trial subjects. They stipulate that the interests of the individual should take precedence over the good of science. Every drug company has policies which conform to these standards. In reality, say activists, these are not adhered to.

The swelling controversy in India has reached the point where the country's parliament was recently told by Brinda Karat, an MP who has called for investigations into abuses: ""There is a gross violation of guidelines and laws concerning clinical trials in our country.""

Campaigners say the lack of regulation is underscored by the situation regarding ethics committees, from which every institution carrying out a trial must receive approval. Such is the laxity in the guidelines that almost anyone can be part of such a body.

Dr Amar Jesani, editor of the Indian Journal of Medical Ethics, said he was asked to join such a committee at a reputable teaching hospital where there were more than 50 trials registered as ongoing. ""There was no organised information about the trials or subjects. When I started going through the protocols so that I could properly assess the study question, the other members said it was the first time they had ever read the protocols,"" he said.

Indian government officials claim the system includes checks and balances which are being continually improved. In an interview, Dr Vishwa Katoch, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said: ""In the last 15 years there has been a remarkable improvement in the functioning of the ethics committees.""

Case study: Sarita Kudumula, 13 - Parents only knew Sarita had been in a study after she died

No one told the parents of 13-year-old Sarita Kudumula that the teenager was involved in a medical study. They first they knew of it was after she collapsed and died, some days after receiving the injection. Discovered on the floor of a relative's home, the young girl was rushed first to the local clinic and then to the nearest hospital. By the time they got her there, she was already dead.

The teenager had been part of a study carried out in a remote part of the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh (AP) to test the feasibility of vaccinating large numbers of young women against the Human Papiloma Virus (HPV), which is sexually transmitted and is one of the causes of cervical cancer. The trial, administered in conjunction with the state government, was led by a US-based NGO, Path, which received millions of dollars from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Samples of an anti-cancer vaccine, Gardasil, produced by US company Merck, were provided free of charge. Officials wished to know whether the vaccine could be introduced as part of a national immunisation programme. Up to 74,000 women in India reportedly die from the disease every year.

It seems unlikely that Sarita died as a result of her participation in the study. No one knows exactly what led to her death or those of six others involved in the study in AP and the western state of Gujarat, where another drug, Cervarix, produced by GlaxoSmithKline, was used instead of Gardasil. Both Path and Merck insist that Gardasil is safe. A post-mortem carried out after the girl's death suggested she had committed suicide ‚Äì a conclusion her parents refuse to accept. A subsequent investigation by the federal government ‚Äì which suspended the trial after the deaths sparked controversy ‚Äì concluded it was unlikely the girls had died as a result of having been given the vaccine.

In a sense, though, the cause of Sarita's death is besides the point. What is beyond dispute is that Sarita's father and mother, Nageshwara and Venkatama, and the parents of hundreds of other tribal girls, were not informed their daughters were taking part in a trial ‚Äì something that is in breach of guidelines laid down by the Medical Research Council of India, which demands that those participating in trials give ""informed consent"". Sarita's family are adivasis, tribal communities who are among the most vulnerable in India, and Sarita attended a government school and hostel, located a few miles from her home. Only tribal girls attend.

""Nobody came to ask us for permission,"" said Sarita's father, a farmer, sitting outside his thatched hut in the village of Anjipakka, as he remembered his daughter, who died in January 2010. ""She enjoyed the hostel. She was a bright student and took part in all the social activities. She was intelligent. She wanted to become a doctor.""

When The Independent visited the pink-painted Government Girls' Ashram and High School in the nearby town of Bhadrachalam, the hostel warden confirmed that health officials had come to the hostel and outlined their plan to vaccinate 300 girls. He said that because it was a government project, he had been told he could authorise the trials without parental permission. ""We did not show any forms or ask for the signatures of the girls or the parents,"" he said. The warden claimed the vaccination programme went off without a hitch.

While the government inquiry did not link the vaccine to the death of the girls or suggest there had been a ""major violation of ethical norms"", members of the enquiry panel were concerned that tribal girls had participated in the study without consent. ""The most significant deficiency in the implementation of the trial was the obtaining of consent,"" said one finding.

Officials at Path's India office say the study was carried out after the vaccine was already licensed and was not strictly a clinical trial. ""Among over 23,000 girls vaccinated [in AP and Gujarat] through the project, seven girls passed away, but the deaths occurred weeks or months following vaccination,"" said Tarun Vij, Path's country head. Regarding consent, he said: ""The state government authorised the wardens to provide this consent for girls who were living at residential schools.""

Spokesmen for the Gates foundation, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline all emphasised that the drugs involved in the studies are safe. A GlaxoSmithKline spokesman added that the trials were carried out according to the same standards wherever they were conducted in the world. On the issue of consent, Gates foundation spokesman Chris William said: ""The implementing partner on the ground (the state of AP) made the decision to empower headmasters to provide consent for this licensed vaccine in some special circumstances. We haven't seen anything that would suggest that the decision should be second-guessed.""

Case study: The Naik family - 'To us a doctor is like a god. We believe them'

Over four years, a close-knit team of senior physicians at the MY hospital in Indore secured and conducted dozens of prestigious trials with drug companies from around the world. They were paid about 50m rupees (¬£625,000). The doctors insist their work was carried out according to guidelines and an ethics committee oversaw what they did.

But to others, there were causes for concern. Funding for the study was given to the doctors involved and not the hospital. It was not clear that participants fully understood what they were volunteering for. And the only doctors to investigate 81 cases where patients had problems after trials were the same doctors who conducted them.

In the summer of 2010, the state government prevented the hospital from conducting new trials while it held an inquiry. A separate, non-criminal police investigation found doctors had ""violated the ethical guidelines on a number of occasions"" and that the ""fundamental concept of informed consent was also overlooked"".

Dr Anand Rai, a physician formerly employed at the hospital who turned whistleblower and was subsequently fired, says that in 81 serious adverse events (SAEs) following 60 trials involving up to 3,000 patients ‚Äì including one case where a trial subject died ‚Äì not one was listed as having been the result of a trial and not one person received compensation.

""To us, a doctor is like a god. We believe everything he says,"" said Ajay Naik, 28, whose baby son, Yatharth, developed white spots on his skin after a trial. ""My wife was told a new multi-vaccine had come that costs 8-10,000 rupees and that it was available free of charge."" They had no idea they were involved in a trial. ""There was a two-page form in English. No one read out the details,"" he said.

The five doctors named in the complaint to the police adamantly deny wrongdoing and claim they are victims of false allegations levelled by the media and campaigners. Dr Pushpa Verma, one of the physicians involved, said the allegations had been made by ""uneducated people"" and that the police were unqualified to investigate the matter. She added: ""There were no ethical violations.""

MEPs warn on dangers of India outsourcing,"Growing fears about the security risk posed by outsourcing call centre jobs to India will today prompt a group of MEPs to call for legislation to protect British consumers from potential fraud.

They want the European Commission to tighten up the Data Protection Act to prevent overseas gangs tapping into UK and US credit card details. The Amicus group of Labour MEPs intends to table plans at this afternoon's Employment and Social Affairs committee that call for Euro-wide legislation.

The move follows reports that Capital One, the US credit card group, scrapped a contract with one of India's biggest call centre operators, Wipro Spectramind, after alleged breaches of credit control.

"Nearly 1 In Every 4 Graduates Looking For A Job, Says Report","Overall unemployment rate for females is at 17.5 per cent versus 6.2 per cent for males.

India's current unemployment rate stands at 7.5 per cent as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). However, the unemployment rate for graduates stands at 18.5 per cent - more than twice the headline rate, according to data for the end of 2019 compiled by CMIE.

The latest findings from the survey conducted by Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy for the period between September and December 2019 has been done after interacting with 1.74 lakh households.

The report depicts a substantial increase in unemployment rate in urban India, which stands at 9 percent compared to unemployment rate in rural India at 6.8 per cent.

The overall unemployment rate for females is at 17.5 per cent versus 6.2 per cent for males. In a more drastic increase, the unemployment rate is as high as 26 per cent for urban females.

Mahesh Vyas, CEO, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV, ""India's headline unemployment rate is at 7.5 per cent but, this understates the real problem on hand which is of lack of sufficient jobs for young graduates.""

""Nearly one in every four graduates in the mid- to late-twenties who is looking for a job is unable to find a job.""

Unemployment Rate Among Indian Women More Than Double Of Men: Study,"A study found that unemployment rate among Indian women more than double of men

The unemployment rate among women in India is more than double of that of men with similar qualifications, a new study has revealed. Titled ""Gender Inclusion in Hiring in India"", the study by two Harvard students, Rachel Levenson and Layla O'Kane, noted that 8.7 per cent of working-age urban, educated women in the country are unemployed but only 4 per cent of comparable men find themselves without a job.

""While there are many factors that influence a woman's decision and ability to find work, the gender gap in the unemployment rate along with ILO (International Labour Organisation) research suggest that women, particularly highly-educated ones, face additional barriers as compared to men in accessing jobs,"" it said.

Levenson and O'Kane's analysis is based on close to 200 India-based jobs for which Shortlist, a hiring firm in India, had provided the recruiting platform between 2016 and 2017. It included 286,991 applications from 211,004 applicants (some people applied to multiple jobs).

According to the study, while discrimination based on gender is illegal under the Indian constitution, conversations with hiring managers and other labour market experts have revealed that there is gender discrimination in the hiring process across the country, as is the case around the world.

The study looks at three stages at which women may face barriers during hiring -- qualifications and experience, recruitment and choice to apply, and application process, while suggesting tools to increase gender diversity in the Indian workforce.

It highlighted the need for gender inclusive work places by correlating it with ""higher levels of performance and innovation"".

""Inclusive hiring improves firm-level growth by allowing companies to attract and retain top talent and better serving consumers in markets or sectors where women are a key customer segment,"" it said.

The study also noted that increasing female participation in the labour force could increase the Indian GDP by 27 per cent.

Not dismissing the progress, albeit little, that several multinational corporations in the country have made towards minimising gender discrimination at work place over the past couple of decades, it highlighted the role technology could play in improving hiring outcomes including increasing the number of women who apply and get shortlisted for jobs.

""We know that diverse teams perform better, and we're encouraged by these results because they show that even small and medium sized businesses, and not just large enterprises, can leverage technology to increase the diversity of their candidate pools,"" said Simon Desjardins, Co-founder of Shortlist.

The study suggested competency-based assessments, behavioral nudges in recruitment, and well-designed job descriptions, for creating a more effective bias-reducing, gender-sensitive hiring process in India.

"Provident Fund Enrolment, Tax Data Can't Measure Jobs: Think Tank Chief","Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct, says Mahesh Vyas (File)

Amid the controversy over the withholding of a report on the country's unemployment situation, the government has cited data from provident fund records, Income Tax filings and the National Pension System (NPS), besides a possible upswing in the informal sector to show generation of crores of new jobs.

However, this does not mean there is an increase in jobs, the chief of the think tank that claimed last month 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 in an alarming report, has said.

During his reply on the motion of thanks on the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said new jobs were created in the unorganised sector, which accounts for 80-85 per cent employment, citing an increase in the sale of commercial vehicles, infrastructure building and housing activities.

He said about 1.8 crore people had enrolled in the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) in the past 15 months, and 64 per cent of them, who were below the age of 28 were first-time employees.

PM Modi also cited the data showing increase in the registration of employees under the National Pension Scheme (NPS) from 65 lakh in March 2014 to 1.2 crore till October 2018.

Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct as it can be formalisation of informal jobs, said Mahesh Vyas, Chief Executive Officer of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a think tank.

""When a person enrols for the EPF, it does not necessarily mean that the person has got a job. It is quite likely that you have enrolled for the EPF for the first time though you had a job for a long time,"" he said.

""The law requires an employer with 20 people or more to register with the EPFO. If a firm has got 19 employees till yesterday and today 20th person joins in, then all 20 get enrolled for the first time. So it looks like employment has gone up by 20 when actually it is one.""

Another expert, who did not wish to be named, said there cannot be a correlation between EPF enrolment and job creation ""since it has so many moving parts and variables, so one could interpret it differently"".

PM Modi also had said that new 6.35 lakh new non-corporate tax payers such as doctors must have provided jobs in past four years. The expert called it ""incomprehensible"" in the absence of the source of the data.

In his speech, the PM said he expected over 1.25 crore people have got jobs in the transport sector with the sale of 36 lakh commercial vehicles and 27 lakh auto-rickshaws.

He also cited setting up of two lakh service call centres, infrastructure building, hotel constructions and housing activities for the creation of employment in the country.

Mr Vyas said if a farmer takes up a labourer's job or moves to driving a truck, it cannot be considered a new job.

According to the CMIE statistics, India's unemployment rate shot up to 7.4 per cent in December, 2018 and the number of unemployed increased by a substantial 11 million - the highest in 15 months.

PM Modi had taken a dig at the past governments for failing to establish standard system to tally employment and said only 7-8 sectors were taken into account to arrive at the employment rate when, in reality, jobs were created in 100-odd sectors.

Mr Vyas said PM Modi was possibly referring to enterprise survey conducted by the Labour Ministry, which is one of the ways to estimate employment.

""That is not the best way to estimate employment and unemployment in country like India. But what the Prime Minister did not mention was that India also conducted a large house-hold survey. It is the most appropriate way of computing it and will capture all sectors. He is partially right but selective in the kind of survey done,"" he said.

""The traditional way, which is a good way of calculating employment and unemployment, is the NSSO household survey,"" he added.

The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report, which the government has withheld, said the unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, post-demonetisation and was at its highest level since 1972-73 - the period since when the jobs data is comparable.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/nsso-unemployment-report-mahesh-vyas-epf-enrolment-income-tax-data-cannot-measure-job-creation-1991205,
"Railways Had 63,000 Job Openings. 19 Million People Applied","Railways Jobs: The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum (AFP)

Anil Gujjar arrived in the national capital from a small village in Rajasthan carrying nothing except a backpack and hopes of finding a good job.

The odds were not in his favor. In February, the Indian railways announced a national recruitment drive for the most menial positions in its hierarchy - helper, porter, cleaner, gateman, track maintainer, assistant switchman.

It attracted 19 million applicants for 63,000 vacancies.

Gujjar, the son of a farmer and the first person in his family to attend college, was one of them. At the test center in Delhi where he took a mandatory exam in November, he looked around warily at hundreds of young men like him. Nearly all were college students or graduates. Some even had master's degrees.

Indian Railways Jobs: Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016 (AFP)

The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, but it is not generating enough jobs - let alone good jobs - for the increasingly educated young people entering the labor force.

By 2021, the number of people in the country between the ages of 15 and 34 is expected to reach 480 million. They have higher levels of literacy and are staying in school longer than any previous generation of Indians. The youth surge represents an opportunity for the country of 1.3 billion, economists say, but only if such young people can find productive work.

Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016. Jobless rates for young people and those with higher educational qualifications increased during the same period, in some cases sharply: The unemployment rate for college graduates jumped from 4.1 percent to 8.4 percent, according to Santosh Mehrotra, a well-known labor economist.

The fate of millions of job-seekers represents a major political liability for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks reelection this year. PM Modi came to power almost five years ago promising ""development for all"" and robust job creation. But his attempts to increase manufacturing and entrepreneurship have not succeeded in turbocharging employment.

Economic growth created fewer jobs in recent years (WP)

Meanwhile, PM Modi's controversial move in late 2016 to invalidate most of the bank notes - ostensibly to stem corruption - had a deleterious impact on workers. About 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research firm in Mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. Its data also showed that the labor force shrank between 2017 and 2018 - not a sign of a healthy job market.

""India is rapidly losing an opportunity,"" said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the research firm. ""We're just arguing needlessly and endlessly rather than deploying all these young people coming into the labor market into productive work."" The result is a ""slow and insidious crisis,"" he said.

For many young people, finding a job is an all-consuming task. An entire industry has sprung up offering ""personality development"" classes - a combination of basic English, social skills and interview preparation advertised as improving employability. Job scams are common, with fraudsters preying on the aspirations of those seeking work.

Educated young men do not want to be ""pakora wallahs"" - people who make the quintessential fried snack - said Radhicka Kapoor, an economist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. ""They want good, productive jobs, and they're going to wait it out until they in fact find these jobs.""

Jobs In Railways: Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry (Representational)

Ajit Ghose, an economist at the Institute for Human Development in Delhi, says that India needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce - who number 6 million to 8 million a year, according to his estimate - but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that paid a decent wage. Ghose has calculated that India has at least 104 million such ""surplus"" workers.

That's a monumental challenge for any government - and one that the leadership is not meeting. Judging the Modi government's track record on job creation is complicated by the fact that it has not released any comprehensive nationwide employment data since 2016. The Labor and Statistics ministries have conducted more-recent employment surveys of households, but those results have not been made public.

""It's anybody's guess whether we'll see any employment statistics come out before the 2019 elections,"" said Amit Basole, an economist at Azim Premji University.

Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry. Meanwhile, he said, his sense was that concerns about job creation are ""overblown,"" given the country's high rates of economic growth.

For educated youths, searching for a job that meets their aspirations can feel like a marathon. At the test center in Delhi, waves of applicants for the railway positions arrived three times a day, each weekday, from September through mid-December - a scene replicated at hundreds of exam centers across the country.

The flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. One entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. Since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam center, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of Rs 50. A vendor sold tube socks and ear buds on the sidewalk.

The railway jobs on offer - sometimes referred to as Group D positions - are junior but offer security and a comparatively good salary. The starting pay is Rs 18,000 a month, plus there are perks such as free train travel.

The stories of the young men - and they were all men, with one exception, at a test center in Delhi over two days - are striking in their sameness. The applicants are mostly college students and college graduates from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who are seeking a way out of the villages where they grew up. There are no jobs there, they said.

Gujjar arrived in Delhi for the first time in his life the evening before his 9 am exam. He spent the night sleeping on a sheet that he spread on the floor of the railway station. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the exam center, where he stood, waiting, in a thin striped sweater, arms crossed against the predawn chill. At 7:35 am, a guard carrying a portable loudspeaker began barking instructions to the assembled test-takers.

Too anxious for chitchat, Gujjar declined to describe how he felt at that moment. ""Ask me after I see the exam paper,"" he said. The posts at Indian Railways held no inherent appeal, he explained. ""It's not about interest,"" he said. ""I just want a job.""

Gujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. A year ago, he tried to join the Indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. There are no opportunities in his village in the district of Jhunjhunu, he said, and most of his friends do not have steady work.

After taking the 90-minute computerized test, Gujjar strode through a blue metal gate with a smile of relief on his face. The exam was not as difficult as he had feared. It will be months before he knows whether he has beaten the odds, which are roughly 1 in 300. ""If I get a job, it will be worth it,"" he said.

Unemployment Major Challenge For India: International Monetary Fund,"IMF said that the reforms being carried out for the past few years might help create jobs. (File)

Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the IMF today exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country.""Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,"" International Monetary Fund spokesperson, Gerry Rice said.Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards.""Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,"" Mr Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth.In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. ""We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,"" he said.And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India's long-term growth but create jobs as well, Mr Rice said.""So we think, all of this will help to spur India's continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,"" Mr Rice said.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unemployment-major-challenge-for-india-international-monetary-fund-1830457,
"Unemployment The Reason Why PM Modi, Donald Trump Were Voted To Power: Rahul Gandhi","Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi interacted with students at Princeton University during his US visit

Leaders like Narendra Modi and Donald Trump are being elected all over the world because people are in pain due to unemployment, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said today, but stressed that even the prime minister was not doing enough to solve the key problem facing India.Mr Gandhi, 47, who is in the US on a two-week-long tour, during his interaction with students at the prestigious Princeton University admitted that the Narendra Modi-led BJP came to power in India because people were angry with the Congress party over the issue of unemployment.Employment is an all-encompassing means to empower, enfranchise and involve Indians in the nation building process, he said.""I think, the central reason why Mr Modi arose and to an extent why Mr Trump came, is the question of jobs in India and in the United States. There's a large part of our populations that simply do not have jobs and cannot see a future. And, so they are feeling pain. And they have supported these types of leaders,"" Mr Gandhi told students.He said the another problem is that nobody was recognising that unemployment was a problem. ""I do not know (Donald) Trump. I don't go there. But, certainly our prime minister is not doing enough (in creating jobs),"" Mr Gandhi said.Mr Gandhi has repeatedly raised the issue of joblessness during his meetings with experts, business leaders and Congressmen in the United States.""Currently, we are not producing enough jobs. 30,000 new youngsters are joining the job market every single day and yet the government is only creating 500 jobs a day. And this doesn't include the massive pool of already unemployed youngsters,"" Mr Gandhi had said in his earlier address at the University of California in Berkeley.At Princeton, Mr Gandhi said India needed to transform itself to compete with China, and for that the people in the country required jobs.""Those same people who got angry with us because we couldn't deliver on those 30,000 jobs (a day) are going to get angry with Mr Modi. The central question is resolving that problem. My main issue with Mr Modi is that he diverts that issue and points the finger somewhere else instead of saying listen we have a problem,"" he said.""There is anger building up in India right now. We can sense it. So to me the challenge is how to solve that job growth problem in a democratic environment. That is the challenge,"" he said.""So we have to first accept it as a problem. Then we have to unite and try to solve it. Right now, nobody is even accepting it as a problem,"" he argued.Focusing a major part of his question and answer session at Princeton on jobs, Mr Gandhi asserted that new technologies and modernisation are unlikely to kill jobs.""The nature of what we call it a blue collar job is going to change. But the question is who is going to have those jobs and which countries are going to have access to those jobs,"" he said.Mr Gandhi also raised the issue of ""polarisation in India"". He said that the ""politics of polarisation"" was a central challenge in India and some sections of the society, including the minority communities and tribal people, who do not feel that they are a part of the ruling BJP's vision.""In the 21st century, if you leave some people out of your vision, you are asking for trouble. New ideas would come, new different visions would develop. So, to me, central challenge in India is politics of polarisation where you pit one community against the other and you create spaces for other people to come in,"" Mr Gandhi said.""There is a belt of 100 million tribal people who do not feel comfortable with the vision (of the BJP). There are a number of states in India, which don't want a single vision forced down their throat. There are minority communities, they do not feel that they are a part of the vision. So that's where the real danger is,"" Mr Gandhi said in response to a question.India's strength has always been its ability to embrace people, he said.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/unemployment-the-reason-why-narendra-modi-donald-trump-were-voted-to-power-rahul-gandhi-1752716,
"Underemployment More Serious Than Unemployment, Says NITI Aayog","The NITI Aayog has warned about underemployment, saying it is more dangerous than unemployment

""Severe underemployment"" and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, the government think tank NITI Aayog said in a report.The opposition Congress party recently claimed that unemployment was rising in India and criticised the Narendra Modi government.In its draft action report that covers three years from fiscal 2018 to 2020, the NITI Aayog stressed on the need for creating high-productivity and high-wage jobs. ""Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India's problems. The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment. A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,"" NITI Aayog said in the report.The draft report was circulated among the think tank's Governing Council members comprising all chief ministers and other officials on April 23.The NITI Aayog said the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which tracks India's employment situation, has consistently reported low but stable rate of unemployment for over three decades, which goes contrary to assertions that India's growth has not been driven by job growth.The NITI Aayog, quoting an NSSO report, said that in fiscal 2012, 49 per cent of India's workforce was employed in agriculture, but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India's Gross Domestic Product at current prices.In fiscal 2011, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India's manufacturing workforce, but contributed only 12 per cent to manufacturing output, the NITI Aayog said in the report.An NSSO survey of service firms in fiscal 2007 found that the 650 largest companies accounted for 38 per cent of services output, but only employed two per cent of service workers, the NITI Aayog said.""Put another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the workforce but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,"" the report said. Citing the example of China's ageing workforce, the NITI Aayog called for taking steps to attract big companies from China to India, which can provide a large number of workers at competitive wages.""The experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers,"" the NITI Aayog report said.""The Make in India campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,"" it said. The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many big firms in labour-intensive sectors in that country are scouting for lower-wage locations. ""With its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,"" the NITI Aayog report said.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/underemployment-serious-than-unemployment-says-niti-aayog-1704808,

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about doing 'surya namaskar' for strengthening his back. It would be good if he could suggest a similar 'asana' to unemployed youngsters,"" he said.

""Unemployment is rising in the country. The prime minister does not have any time to think about it. At least he could suggest an 'asana', "" he added.

PM Modi had hit out at opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, whom he dubbed as a ""tubelight"", saying it took him 30-40 minutes to respond to his speech in the Lok Sabha.

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, the prime minister, in his reply to the discussion on the presidential address, referred to the Congress leader's comments about ""youngsters beating up Modi with sticks over the lack of jobs"", and said he would increase the number of ""surya namaskar"" so that his back could bear the sticks.

""In these six months, I will do more surya namaskar so that my back is ready for the beating.... I have been subjected to abuses in the last 20 years, I will make myself gaali-proof as also danda-proof,"" PM Modi had said.

Back-Breaking Inflation Created Financial Emergency: Rahul Gandhi,"Rise in prices of vegetables, edible oil, LPG, food items has snatched away the poor's bread Rahul Gandhi

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said rising prices of essential commodities and unemployment have thrown the country into a state of ""financial emergency"".

He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""snatching away"" the poor man''s bread and ""breaking into pieces"" the domestic budget of Indians.

""Back-breaking inflation, life-threatening unemployment and falling GDP has created a state of ''financial emergency''.

Retail inflation rose to about five-and-half year high of 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI's comfort level, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables as onions were selling costlier.

Highlights Report by industry body CII found surge in small business job creation

Report extrapolates findings from just one sector, survey in few states

Report contradicts others which claim high unemployment, shrinking sector

Amid a swirling debate over unemployment in India ahead of general elections next month, a recently released survey by top industry body, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which reported a surge in job creation in India's small businesses, found favour with the government.

A number of ministers - from Railways Minister Piyush Goyal to Information Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore tweeted the findings of the report, which found that job creation in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector had grown by 14 per cent from 2014-18, the first 4 years of the Modi government.

The finding startled observers, given the mass of data, official and private, which suggested a deepening of India's unemployment problem, as well as a slowdown of the small businesses sector.

An analysis of the CII report throws up a number of questions over its findings and methodology.

The CII admits that its sample for the survey, of one lakh firms, is heavily skewed towards India's more advanced states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. The number of firms polled in these states amount, respectively, to 25 per cent, 12 per cent and 8 per cent of the total survey. The basis for greater 'bias' to these states, according to the survey, is because of higher employee provident fund enrolments in these states.

But government data shows that the share of MSME's in these three states is far less, at 8 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, much lower than states such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

The CII report found that between 2014 and 2018, job creation grew at 3.3 per cent annually in the MSME sector.

However the government's own data from the ministry of MSME, shows that between 2006 and 2016, the annual growth rate of employment in the MSME sector was 3.6 per cent, a touch higher than the CII's number.

Eight of those 10 years predate the Modi government.

The survey has also invited criticism for projecting the total job growth in the country using its study of the MSME sector.

According to the CII study, the total workforce in the country is 450 million. ""A simple extrapolation of the findings from the survey (of 3.3 per cent job growth in MSMEs) on macro-level data indicates that 13.5 - 14.9 million (1.3 -1.5 crore) jobs were created per annum,"" the survey states.

This is flawed reasoning, argue experts, given that every sector grows at a different pace. For instance, the annual job growth in the manufacturing sector was 1 per cent while, in the construction sector was -3 per cent between October 2016 and 2017.

The correct method would have been to project job creation on the basis of the size of the workforce employed by the MSME sector alone, which is 110 million (according to government data), not 450 million.

Attempts to seek a response from CII were unsuccessful.

""CII is a pretty well established organisation and I think it is important that its credibility is not damaged too much. Anyone who does a survey would very easily indicate that there are many problems in this,"" Mahesh Vyas, MD and CEO of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/cii-jobs-report-multiple-anomalies-emerge-in-new-jobs-surge-report-tweeted-by-ministers-2007068,
"""India Lost Over 1 Crore Jobs In 2018"": Congress Slams BJP Citing Report","Congress alleged that the Centre failed to fulfil its promise of providing two crore jobs every year.

The Congress on Sunday targeted the BJP-led Centre over ""growing employment"" in India, citing a think-tank report to claim that over one crore jobs were lost last year.

Referring to a report by the think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari alleged that the BJP-led NDA government failed to fulfil its promise of providing two crore jobs every year and that the country lost one crore jobs instead.

""During the 2014 elections, PM Modi had promised ''Acche Din'' (good days), which included (providing) two crore jobs every year. In five years, this sums up to 10 crore (jobs).

""But recently, a reputed think-tank, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), released a report on employment. It states that more than one crore people lost their jobs in just one year (2018),"" he said.

The Congress leader said according to the report, in December 2017, 40.79 crore people were employed. In 2018, it was reduced to 39.07 crore.

""Which means more than one crore people lost their jobs. It is astonishing that more than 80 per cent of those unemployed were women and more than 90 per cent belonged to rural India,"" Mr Tewari said citing the report.

He also claimed that India's unemployment rate increased to 7.4 per cent in December 2018.

""This is the highest in a decade. Daily wage labourers and small businesses suffered the most. These are the same who were affected by demonetisation,"" the Congress leader said.

The government has said the report was incomplete and hence was not released.

His views were supported by his boss, Niti Aayog's Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant. ""The story of jobs is all over this budget. You cannot have growth without distributed prosperity,"" Mr Kant said.

The opposition Congress has contended that ""jobs"" was one of the two words missing from the interim budget, which, they said was the government's ""last jumla (political gimmick)"" and ""political manifesto"" before the national elections due by May.

Yesterday, Business Standard newspaper reported that the unemployment rate in the country was at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. The data it quoted was from the National Sample Survey Office's periodic labour force survey.

Two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission, which vets the report, had quit on Tuesday, accusing the centre of withholding its release.

Explaining the situation, Mr Kumar said, ""When the (jobs) report came to the government, we realised the data for subsequent quarters was missing. And that's why it was not released"".

"Claims Of Rising Unemployment A ""Political Gimmick"", Says PM Modi","Dismissing claims of unemployment, PM Modi said 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector. (File)

Calling the opposition claims on rising unemployment a ""political gimmick"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that over 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone, in the last one year.

Based on Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data, more than 45 lakh formal jobs were created between September 2017 and April 2018, PM Modi said in an email interview to The Times of India published on Sunday.

""According to our study based on the EPFO data, more than 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone last year,"" he said.

Attacking the opposition, he said that rather than the so-called failure of this government to create jobs, ""I believe the shortcoming lies in the absence or lack of a streamlined database of jobs. Naturally, in the absence of information, our opponents will exploit this situation and blame us for not creating jobs"".

PM Modi also called the opposition's claim of rising unemployment a ""propaganda"".

""If you look at claims made by the state governments -- Bengal says it created 68 lakh jobs and the previous Karnataka government claimed it created 53 lakh jobs -- are we saying that all the country's jobs are being created in some states and that other states and the country as a whole are not creating jobs? This propaganda on jobs by the opposition is nothing but a political gimmick,"" he said.

PM Modi said that informal sector accounts for around 80 per cent of all jobs and creation of jobs in the formal sector has a spin-off effect on job creation in the informal sector.

""There are close to three lakh village-level entrepreneurs who run common service centres across the country and create employment. More than 12 crore loans have been given under MUDRA Scheme,"" he said.

PM Modi said that in the last four years, construction roads, railways and residential areas was undertaken and that led to generation of jobs.

""All reports, whether national or international, show that poverty in India is on the decline. Can we think of such a possibility without people having jobs?"" he asked.

Asserting that tourism provides maximum employment, PM Modi said that the country's tourism sector has been growing rapidly with foreign tourist arrivals in India in 2017 registering a growth of 14 per cent over 2016.

Unemployment In India To Increase Marginally In 2017-18: Report,"Highlights Job creation in India not expected to pick up in 2017, 2018, says report

Unemployment in India projected to rise marginally in 2017, 2018

India performed slightly well in job creation in 2016, UN report adds

United Nations: Unemployment in India is projected to witness marginal increase between 2017 and 2018, signalling stagnation in job creation in the country, according to a UN labour report.



The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) released its 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report yesterday, which finds economic growth trends lagging behind employment needs and predicts both rising unemployment and worsening social inequality throughout 2017.



Job creation in India is not expected to pick up pace in 2017 and 2018 as unemployment rises slightly, representing a near stagnation in percentage terms.



""Unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7 million last year to 17.8 million in 2017 and 18 million next year. In percentage terms, unemployment rate will remain at 3.4 per cent in 2017-18,"" the report added.



India had performed slightly well in terms of job creation in 2016, when a ""majority"" of the 13.4 million new employment created in Southern Asia happened in the country.



The report also acknowledged that India's 7.6 per cent growth in 2016 helped Southern Asia achieve 6.8 per cent growth that year.



""Manufacturing growth has underpinned India's recent economic performance, which may help buffer demand for the region's commodity exporters,"" it added.



The report added that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent (from 5.7 per cent in 2016) - representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017).



""We are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labour market entrants every year,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.



The increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries - as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017.





The number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 (during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016), it said.""Almost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,"" said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.That statistic is even worse for emerging countries.Those living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing the greatest risk. In contrast, unemployment is expected to fall in 2017 in developed countries (by 670,000), bringing the rate down to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2016.In Europe, notably Northern, Southern and Western Europe, unemployment levels and rates are both expected to continue to fall, but the pace of improvement will slow, and there are signs that structural unemployment is worsening.The ILO advocates policy approaches that address root causes of secular stagnation as well as structural impediments to growth.""Boosting economic growth in an equitable and inclusive manner requires a multi-faceted policy approach that addresses the underlying causes of secular stagnation, such as income inequality, while taking into account country specificities,"" said Tobin.Such progress, the ILO emphasised, is only possible through international cooperation. A coordinated effort to provide fiscal stimuli and public investments would go a long way to provide an immediate jump start to the global economy and could eliminate an anticipated rise in unemployment for two million people.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-in-india-to-increase-marginally-in-2017-18-report-1648457,
"More Workers, Fewer Jobs in World's Fastest Growing Economy","A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015

Highlights A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds

Job creation is a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old

It's been two years since India emerged as the world's fastest-growing major economy, but the rapid expansion has done little to improve the lot of Ashok Kumar.



Parked up and sitting on the kerb, the 25-year-old truck driver is going nowhere fast. He is the sole breadwinner for the 13 people in his extended family and his monthly salary is stuck at $150 (Rs 10,000).



With new, better-paid jobs hard to come by, Kumar lacks options. He fears becoming unemployed like his elder brother, who recently returned to their village in in Uttar Pradesh after months of searching in vain for work.



Data out on Wednesday showed India's economic growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in the quarter to June, a 15-month low. That is faster than other major economies, but not fast enough to create enough new jobs to absorb all the one million people who join the workforce every month.



A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015. Analysts at HDFC Bank estimate that for every percentage point the economy grows, employment now adds just 0.15 of a percentage point - down from 0.39 in 2000.



It's a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to create 25 crore jobs over the next decade.



""For one job, there are at least 20 candidates,"" said Kumar. ""If you want the job, you can't afford to bargain.""



Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old. This rising demographic ""bulge"" will create the largest working-age population in the world. At the same time China, which has long curbed family size, will age as a society.



Whether this so-called demographic dividend will translate into the kind of economic gains seen in Japan and Korea, or lead to upheavals, depends on India's ability to generate jobs.



Yet, despite average annual growth of 6.5 per cent between 1991 and 2013, India added less than half the jobs needed to absorb new job seekers.



MORE WORKERS, FEWER JOBS



Under PM Modi, India has opened up further to foreign investment, hoping to generate more manufacturing jobs. A loan scheme for small businesses has been set up and there are plans for a $1.5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore) fund for startups.

India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37 per cent in February from 5.97 per cent in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65 per cent from 9.70 per cent, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-news-february-jobless-rate-rises-to-7-78-highest-in-4-months-says-think-tank-cmie-2188403,
"Unemployment Rate At 9.3% In March Quarter, Lowest In 4 Years","The unemployment figures for the first quarter of this year are out and there is a slight reason for cheer for a government facing the biggest flak for not generating enough jobs.

The urban unemployment rate fell to 9.3 per cent between January and March this year, the lowest in at least four quarters. It stood at 9.9 per cent in the previous quarter, says a survey by the National Statistical Organisation. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available in the Periodic Labour Force Survey and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.

The estimates are worked out on what is called current weekly status method. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.

Joblessness among youth aged between 15 and 29 years was at 22.5 per cent during the January-March period this year, down from 23.7 per cent in the previous quarter. This segment accounts for over one third of India's 1.3 billion people.

The Narendra Modi government has been criticised for not regularly releasing comprehensive data on jobs. Figures had shown joblessness at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The labour force participation rate - the percentage of population that supplies labour force for all economic activity - was 36 per cent during the March quarter, the survey showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.

India's economic growth fell to an over four-year low of 5.8% in the January-March period. It fell further to 5 per cent in the following quarter.

The survey also showed that of the total workforce, 37.7 per cent were self-employed, 50 per cent were salaried or regular workers and 12.4 per cent were casual labourers.",https://www.ndtv.com/business/unemployment-rate-declines-to-9-3-per-cent-in-jan-mar-2019-2138260,
Urban Unemployment Rate Drops To Lowest In 4 Quarters: Government Data,"The NSO said urban unemployment rate was 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018

Amid criticism over high unemployment rate, a survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Saturday showed that urban unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in four quarters at 9.3 per cent during January-March 2019.

The quarterly bulletin of Periodic Labour Force Survey by the NSO, released on Saturday, does not contain comparable figure for January-March 2018.

The NSO, which is a wing of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, stated in the bulletin that the urban unemployment rate (UR) was 9.9 per cent in April-June 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018.

The first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ending December 2018 was brought out in May 2019. This bulletin for the March 2019 quarter is the second in the series. The data showed that UR in urban areas among males was at 8.7 per cent during January-March 2019.

This unemployment rate among male in urban areas was 9 per cent in April-June 2018, 8.9 per cent in July-September and 9.2 per cent in October-December last year. For women, the UR was at 11.6 per cent during January-March 2019.

While this rate for women during April-June 2018 was 12.8 per cent, in July-September was 12.7 per cent and in October-December last year was 12.3 per cent.

The government had been receiving criticism for high unemployment rates amid slowing economic growth. In May this year, government data had shown that unemployment rate in the country was 6.1 per cent of total labour force during 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The survey on Saturday pointed out that the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) was estimated as 36 per cent in the urban areas during January-March 2019, as compared to 35.6 per cent during April- June 2018. The LFPR was 36.1 per cent in July-September and 36.3 per cent in October-December last year.

The LFPR for men was estimated to be 56.2 per cent, while for women it was at 15 per cent in the urban areas during the January-March 2019 period.

The LFPR for men was 56 per cent in April-June, 56.3 in July September and 56.4 in October-December last year.

Similarly, the LFPR for women was 14.6 per cent in April-June and 15.3 in July-September and 15.4 per cent in October-December last year. This indicates that women participation in employment has improved slightly till October-December last year but deteriorated a little bit in January-March 2019.

Labour force refers to the part of the population which supplies or offers to supply labour for pursuing economic activities for the production of goods and services and, therefore, includes both ""employed"" and ""unemployed"" persons.

The LFPR is defined as the percentage of population in the labour-force. Labour-force according to current weekly status (CWS) is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of 7 days preceding the date of survey. In Statement 1, LFPR in CWS are presented.

"Unemployment Rate At 6.1%; Calling It 45-Year High Unfair, Says Centre","A report earlier said unemployment rate was the highest since 1972-73. (Representational)

The country's unemployment rate was at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the statistics ministry said on Friday, confirming the figure leaked to Business Standard newspaper in January, which said it was the highest since 1972-73. The data was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn-in for his second term. The BJP won a huge majority in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several years, and the government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate. ""It's a new design, new metric... It would be unfair to compare it with the past,"" chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters.

Business Standard, which first reported the figure in January, had said that it was based on an assessment carried out by the National Sample Survey Office between July 2017 and June 2018.

The unemployment rate was the highest since 1972-73, the newspaper reported without giving a figure for that fiscal year.

The statistics ministry also said that female labour participation rate in urban areas for the quarter ending December 2018 was 19.5 per cent, compared with 73.6 per cent for males.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8 per cent in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years.

Unemployment and the economy had been pitched as major issues by the Congress during the campaign for the national elections. However, the party faced a crushing defeat in the elections, winning just 52 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha.

"50 Lakh Lost Jobs Over 2 Years, Trend Began Just After Notes Ban: Report","A government report leaked earlier this year said unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

Highlights Azim Premji University in Bengaluru released a report on jobs

Job losses are higher when women are taken into account, report says

A government report said unemployment rate at 45-year high in 2017-18

Fifty lakh men lost their jobs in the past two years beginning November 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an overnight ban on high value currency, according to a new report. The timing of the start of the decline in jobs coincides with demonetisation but no ""causal link"" can be established based on the available data, says the ""State of Working India 2019"", released Tuesday by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.

The job losses are higher when women are taken into account.

""Whether or not this decline was caused by demonetisation, it is definitely a cause for concern and calls for urgent policy intervention,"" the report says.

It assesses that unemployment, in general, has risen steadily post 2011 and the higher educated and the young are vastly over-represented among the unemployed.

In addition to open employment among the educated, the less educated have seen job losses and reduced work opportunities over this time period. The numbers, says the report, clearly demonstrate why unemployment has emerged as the primary economic issue in the election.

A government report leaked earlier this year had said the country's unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

The National Sample Survey Office's Periodic Labour Force Survey, conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73. The report was withheld by the government but accessed by the Business Standard newspaper.

But NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said the report was ""not verified"" and the ""veracity of the data is not known"".

The latest report says the decline in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and workforce participation rate (WPR) has largely been driven by less-educated men in both urban and rural areas.

""Clearly, there is a large differential impact by level of education. This is consistent with the idea that the informal sector, where we can expect the share of less educated men to be higher, was hit hardest by demonetisation as well as the introduction of GST.""

The report says joblessness is not only a problem limited to the educated sections of the labour force. ""While open unemployment may still be low among the less educated, there has been a marked tendency to drop out of the labour force for this section, presumably due to loss of work opportunities,"" it says.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/50-lakh-lost-jobs-over-2-years-trend-began-just-after-notes-ban-report-2024268,
"""Jobs Dipping Amid 7.5% Growth?"": Arun Jaitley Junks ""Unverified"" Report","Arun Jaitley maintained that the NSSO report cannot be taken at face value.

Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday brushed aside a leaked report that suggested a four-decade high in unemployment rate under the Narendra Modi government, terming it as an ""unverified draft"" that cannot be taken at face value. ""I don't think that is a report. It's a draft that has not been approved,"" he said.

The Union Minister, who is currently hospitalised in the United States, put forth a few numbers to drive home his point. ""If 7.5% is the real growth in Gross Domestic Product, and inflation is at 3-4%, the nominal growth needs to be around 11-12%. It would be absurd to say that there are no jobs in such a scenario,"" he said, referring to the controversial National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) findings.

According to the NSSO report, India's unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18 -- the most since the early seventies. It also found that unemployment was higher in urban areas (7.8%) then rural zones (5.3%), and youth unemployment was at ""astronomically high"" levels of 13% to 27%. The report further claimed that more people were withdrawing from the workforce because the labour force participation rate is lower than in previous years.

Controversy arose after two non-independent members quit the data-collating body on Tuesday, alleging that the government was averse to releasing the report despite vetting by the National Statistical Commission in December. Congress president Rahul Gandhi used the issue to compare Prime Minister Narendra Modi to German dictator Adolf Hitler. ""NoMo Jobs! The Fuhrer promised us 2 Cr jobs a year. 5 years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a National Disaster. Unemployment is at its highest in 45 yrs. 6.5 Cr youth are jobless in 2017-18 alone. Time for NoMo2Go,"" he tweeted.

Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal linked it to the demonetisation initiative, calling it a ""mega scam"" orchestrated by the Union government.

Defending the government was planning body Niti Aayog, with its head -- Amitabh Kant -- asserting that the demand for jobs was being met. ""You can't be growing at 7.2 per cent and say no jobs are being created. To my mind, the major problem is the lack of quality jobs,"" he said.

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal also made a similar claim.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised two crore jobs every year in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

India Is The Nation Of The Most Unemployed In The World: Labour Bureau Statistics,"According to the Labour Bureau statistics, India has, today, become the nation of the most unemployed in the world; in the inclusive growth index we are at number sixty and in this case, we are far behind our neighbours.



On the economic development front, inequality and increasing unemployment is the biggest challenge for the fast emerging India. Self-employment opportunities are declining in the country and jobs are continuously decreasing.

But at the same time, another picture is that India is one of the fastest growing peak economies in the world. At some point in time, we have managed to climb up 30 places in the 'Business Accessibility Index'. So the question arises that what is the path of development that we are going to follow to ensure employment generation and equality for everyone?

Indeed, the pace of increasing inequality in India has reached historically high levels. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased alarmingly. This situation is the result of our unemployment growth and non-public spending on GDP growth path.

In the last few decades, most of the countries in the world have developed their economies, but due to privatisation, public capital, and resources have been reduced to the hands of selected few.

In India, economic reforms were implemented in the nineties. Since then, there has been an unprecedented creation of wealth in the country. According to the Credit Suisse Global, multinational financial services company, since 2000, there has been an increase in the value of 9.9 percent annually in India, while its global average has been only 6 percent.

But its benefits have not been found in the large population of the country. Despite India's share in global assets (sixth), the average assets of Indians are much lower than the global average.

In the meanwhile, the inequality has expanded in the distribution of public resources in the country and nearly one-third of the population is still forced to live below the poverty line. The condition is that India has slipped to the hundredth place in the Global Hunger Index of 2017, and in this case, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and many African countries have a better performance than India, while we were at 97th in 2016.

According to Oxfam, only one percent of the people on the global level have only 50 percent wealth. But this figure stands at 58 percent in India and 57 billionaires have assets equal to 70 percent of the country's population.

According to another report from Oxfam, 'The Widening Gaps: India Inequality Report 2018', economic inequality in India is increasing rapidly. In the country's GDP, 15 percent of the wealth has been made, while the share was 10 percent five years ago.

India is the second largest country in the world in terms of population. About 65 percent of the population in the country has an average age of less than 35 years. Such a large young population could be our strength, but due to lack of adequate employment in the country, a large number of youth is unemployed.

According to data from the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation, the number of young unemployed in the country is very high. This is causing the feeling of dissatisfaction in the society.

Similarly, in spite of all efforts, the participation of women in the total labor force of the country is only 27 percent (In the labor force, household work and care, such as unpaid work is not included). The latest estimates from the World Bank show that in the period from 2004-05 to 2011-12, 19.6 percent of the women moved out of labor force, which is a major drop.

The importance of women's involvement in the labour force can be understood in such a way that the International Monetary Fund estimates that if the presence of women in India's labor force becomes as much as that of men, then it will help in increasing our GDP by 27 percent.

In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a special emphasis in Goal 8 has been given to 'continuous inclusive and sustained economic development for all, to promote full and productive employment and better work' by 2030. Also mentioned in the same goal - 'By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training'.

India is also working towards fulfilling this goal and generating employment for all. Various schemes like Skill India, Make in India, Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMGEP), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana play an important role in this.

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship was formed in 2014 by the government. After which the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana was launched in 2015. Its aim was to develop the skill of the youth to make them self-employed. But there were many obstacles to the success of this scheme.

Before the scheme started, there was no pre-assessment done of the requirement of the industries and the kind of skills that were being provided to the youth, resulting in a total mismatch when the scheme was launched. The level of training being provided was also below standard and not of the highest quality.

Workers of India are passing through a kind of transition period. The agricultural sector's contribution to the GDP is around 13 percent, but still half of India's population depends on agriculture. On one hand, the agricultural sector is not able to bear this pressure; on the other hand, people here are not required to have the skills required for other jobs. Perhaps, that's why the cost of MNREGA increases.

MNREGA is the only law in our country that guarantees 100 days of employment to all in rural areas. Although there have been many questions arising out of this, due to being only rural centric, guaranteed for only 100 days, corruption and other problems related to implementation, the importance of MNREGA cannot be denied.

In the concept of inclusive development, the development of people of all sections of society, castes, and communities have been included. In this scale, aspects like living, health, education, and environmental status are judged. In the coming days, if we continue to follow this model of development while ignoring the inclusive growth, the inequities will get deeper.

Therefore, it is necessary to increase the public expenditure on basic services such as education and health, and pay special attention to employment generation.

''India far ahead of US, Europe in women''s tech equity''

Bengaluru, Nov 6 (IANS) Women''s employment in technical jobs is far ahead in India than the US and Europe, said a global professional women''s empowerment advocate on Wednesday.

""The US is actually behind India in tech equity ratio, it is about 25.5 per cent in the US and even lesser in Europe. We are proud of the progress women have made in India,"" Brenda Darden Wilkerson, Chief Executive and President, AnitaB.org, told IANS on the sidelines of the Grace Hopper Celebration India 19, a women''s tech conference.

According to Indian IT industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), women IT employees in India constitute 34 per cent of the total workforce of 4.1 million people.

""Approximately, one third of IT employees in India are women,"" NASSCOM Vice President K.S. Vishwanathan told IANS.

Bengaluru headquartered global software major Infosys had a women employee share of 37 per cent at the end Q2, 2019-20, translating to roughly 88,446 employees.

On choosing India to annually organise the Grace Hopper Celebration conference after the parent event in the US, Wilkerson hailed the country as an important contributor to the tech industry.

""The women here are educated in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and have great aspiration for technology,"" said Wilkerson.

At the conference, she sounded the bugle for attaining tech equity in the order of 50:50 ratio by 2025, a goal to ensure 50 per cent women employees in technical jobs at all levels.

According to Wilkerson, the recipe to achieve tech equity is to extensively collaborate with multinational companies and hit at the root of the issues stopping women from blossoming on the tech landscape.

""Networking, support, mentorship and sponsorship are very important for the success of all people, men included. So we want to be able to provide these steps to women,"" Wilkerson said.

About the rationale for not yet collaborating with the Indian government, Wilkerson said that corporates are major tech employers with whom AnitaB.org is heavily collaborating for the women''s cause.

The non-profit organisation creates communities for women involving corporates to build digital platforms to reach women in the hinterland as well.

Named after American computer scientist Anita Borg, the organisation aims to connect, inspire and guide women in computing and organisations, which view technology innovation as a strategic imperative.

Why Female Participation In Workforce Is On The Decline In India?,"Why is female participation in the workforce on the dec¬≠line in India? It is a conundrum that is flummoxing many. As against a 45.4 per cent med¬≠ian female share of the workforce in 144 countries, a study released by Pew Research Center in March 2017 had ranked India, with 25.9 per cent share, among the 10 lowest. The study was based on labour force data from 2010 to 2016. The latest National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data for 2017-18, yet to be officially released, shows female participation in the workforce has dec¬≠lined further to 23.3 per cent, as per NSSO data reported by Somesh Jha in a business daily.

The new data raises questions on why women are not participating in the workforce in greater numbers when in most examinations for higher studies or even competitive jobs they seem to outscore male counterparts. The latest NSSO data on youth (15-29 years) shows that their participation has dropped from 37.1 per cent in 2004-05 and 24.4 per cent in 2011-12 to just 16.4 per cent in 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe number of women applying for jobs is increasing, with more opting for higher education. But many opt not to take up a job if the job profile is not what they are seeking,‚Äù says R.P. Yadav, CMD Genius Consultant Ltd, a placement agency with over 50,000 employees on its rolls. Yadav feels that the new maternity leave provision of 26 weeks, as against the earlier provision of three months, has done much to put women candidates at a disadvantage when competing for a job against males. ‚ÄúThough the number of women in employment has risen, a rec¬≠ent trend is that a larger number don‚Äôt ret¬≠urn to work after taking maternity leave. Aro¬≠und 40 per cent opt to quit, bringing down their share,‚Äù opines Yadav.

While economists agree that longer maternity leave may have impacted chances of young women below 40 seeking jobs in the formal sector, they point out that this provision does not apply in the informal sector‚Äîemployer of a vast majority of women. Jayati Ghosh of JNU agrees that maternity leave has rocked the cradle to some extent as the burden has been kept only on the employer. ‚ÄúWhen you do that, employers would prefer not to employ women. There should be public provision for maternity benefit, which till now does not extend to the informal sector, tiny enterprises and self-employed,‚Äù says Prof Ghosh. She feels the government, through the National Food Security Act, should provide monetary help equivalent to three months of minimum wage.

Jayan Jose Thomas of IIT Delhi states that only social factors don‚Äôt contribute to the declining trend, as they were there earlier too. ‚ÄúPart of it, in the case of rural women, is due to withdrawal from agriculture due to mechanisation, fall in farm incomes, rapid urbanisation, etc. In 2004-05, we saw a rise in construction jobs, especially for males, which meant more income leading to migration from villages to towns.‚Äù

However, decline of women in the urban workforce should be of greater con¬≠¬≠cern. ‚ÄúThe period from 2004-05 to 2011-12 was one of the best in terms of economic growth when employment opp¬≠¬≠¬≠ortunities in industry and services sho¬≠uld have increased tremendously, with 15 million jobs being created every year. The actual increase in jobs was, how¬≠ever, only half the potential and women took the brunt of this. Things may have worsened post 2011-12,‚Äù says Thomas.

Bina Agarwal, professor of development economics and environment, University of Manchester, points out a striking statistic in the leaked NSSO employment report--the almost three-fold rise in unemployment rates for young rural women (15-29 yrs), from 4.8 per cent in 2011-12 to 13.6 per cent in 2017-18. The urban rate of 27.2 per cent is twice that. ‚ÄúThis reinforces what gender economists have long been saying--that women want to work, but lack jobs. The 2011-12 NSS found that 32 per cent of rural women engaged in domestic activities were willing to work, if they found suitable jobs. The much-discussed low labour force participation among Indian women is not due to cultural norms, dom¬≠estic work burdens and undercounting. It‚Äôs increasingly due to lack of jobs. Planning for female employment must also include safe transport and hostels near workplaces.‚Äù

Economists say that the way women‚Äôs work is defined in surveys is flawed. Sabina Dewan, president of JustJobs Network, states that while female participation in workforce has been sliding over last several years, the extent of the drop, whether female or male, actually depends on how each survey defines women‚Äôs work. ‚ÄúIf you look across surveys, the levels are not the same. So it is critical to have a standardisation of how we define women‚Äôs work,‚Äù Dewan states.

Renana Jhabvala, economist and social worker, points to a study conducted in Bihar four years back using NSSO yardstick that had revealed 56 per cent of women were engaged in gainful work, while the NSSO 2011-12 survey had determined 11 per cent women as working. ‚ÄúThe difference came up because of our deeper probe. Similar intensive studies in different states have come up with huge difference in data on women in workforce. Which bring us to the question: are we collecting the right data? Is the NSSO missing out a whole lot of women engaged in gainful activity?‚Äù asks Jhabvala.

Jhabvala, long associated with the Self-Employed Women‚Äôs Association (SEWA), says there is no dearth of women seeking gainful employment. Of the many reasons why numbers of working women are declining, she says, one is that many are opting to continue their education. There is also a push towards mechanisation, including in agriculture and changing family structures, from joint families to nuclear families. ‚ÄúAll these factors are leading to the drop. But more problematic is that when women enter the workforce they don‚Äôt necessarily find the jobs they are seeking, they are not allowed to progress same as men, they most often don‚Äôt even have parity in pay. There is persistent gender inequality in the labour market and women are often relegated to poor value add work,‚Äù states Jhabvala.

While more women opt to continue education, many are deterred by unsuitable jobs, bias in pay and work conditions vis-a-vis male workers.

Studies have also revealed that many women avail of the option not to work, or tend not to work. This worldwide trend is more pronounced in slightly better-off families. The better off you are, the better are the chances of giving up a middling or poor quality job or of quitting for family responsibilities, as a NSSO survey showed.

Indeed, once women take up jobs, factors like work atmosphere, safety, family support etc influence their duration in the workforce. Also, re-entry into the wor¬≠kforce after a break is often difficult, which partly explains the drop in par¬≠¬≠tici¬≠pation. From lack of family support to the easy availability of labour for low value-¬≠added jobs‚Äîmany are the factors that impede a return to work. In purely economic terms, if more women work, the more they have to spend, giving the economy a fillip. More needs to be done to arrest their decline in the workforce.

Absolute decline in India's employment post 2013: Report,"New Delhi, Sep 25 (IANS) Indias structural transformation has been slower than desired resulting in a situation that there has been an absolute decline in employment post 2013, with the rate of unemployment among the youth now at 16 per cent, says a report by one of the country's noted private universities released on Tuesday.

The State of Working India (SWI) report by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University said there is an urgent need to think comprehensively about employment and for the government to formulate a focused National Employment Policy.

""Even as GDP growth rates have risen, the relationship between growth and employment generation has become weaker over time. Growth creates fewer jobs than it used to. A 10 per cent increase in GDP now results in less than 1 per cent increase in employment,"" the SWI report said.

""Between 2013 and 2015, total employment actually shrank by seven million. More recent data from private sources show that the absolute decline has continued past 2015,"" it said.

""A recent study claims, to the contrary, that the economy generated 13 million new jobs in 2017. Unfortunately, this optimistic conclusion depends on selective use of data and unjustified assumptions. As a result, the rate of unemployment among the youth and higher educated has reached 16 per cent.""

India's new payroll data prepared by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) shows that around 9.5 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector in July, as against the requirement of more than a million joining the workforce each month.

The SWI report conceives of India's ongoing structural transformation as composed of two processes -- movement of workers from agriculture to non-farm occupations and from informal to formal activities -- while it adds crucial considerations of social equity and ecological sustainability to this framework.

India's problem has traditionally been known as not one of unemployment but underemployment and low wages, according to the report.

""But a new feature of the economy is a high rate of open unemployment, which is now over 5 per cent overall, and a much higher 16 per cent for youth and the higher educated,"" it said.

""The increase in unemployment is clearly visible all across India, but is particularly severe in the northern states.""

According to SWI, adjusted for inflation, wage rates have grown in most sectors at 3 per cent per annum or more.

""But 82 per cent of male and 92 per cent of female workers earn less than Rs 10,000 a month,"" it said.

In this regard, the minimum salary recommended by the Seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC) is Rs 18,000 per month.

""Even in the organised manufacturing sector 90 per cent of the industries pay wages below the CPC minimum. The situation is worse in the unorganised sector,"" the report said.

Last but not least, gender disparities are still high but are reducing in some cases, according to the SWI.

Women are 16 per cent of all service sector workers but 60 per cent of domestic workers, while overall women earn 65 per cent of men's earnings.

""The Indian economy remains heavily gender segregated. Occupationally, women are under-represented among senior officers, legislators and managers. The situation has worsened with the proportion falling from 13 per cent in 2011 to 7 per cent in 2015,"" the report said.

The ratio of male to female labour force participation rate varies from less than 0.2 in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to 0.5 in Tamil Nadu as well as Andhra Pradesh, and to above 0.7 in Mizoram and Nagaland, it added.

ILO meet on employment growth in India,"New Delhi, May 20 The International Labour Organization (ILO) will hold high level discussions to prepare a roadmap for India which needs to achieve 3.9 per cent employment growth per annum for meeting the target of employment for all by 2012.



The UN agency dealing with work and workplace issues has organised a two-day National Technical Consultation on Employment Policy for India here from tomorrow jointly with the Union Labour Ministry to evolve a new national employment strategy for the country.



A background report prepared for the meeting said employment-intensive growth did not necessarily require labour-intensive technologies to be used as growth could be promoted in sectors that are by their nature labour intensive.



The report said the strategies developed need to reflect the enormous economic contribution of women.



The meeting will take a diagnostic approach, said Leyla Tegmo-Reddy, ILO Sub-Regional Director for South Asia.



India has enjoyed impressive economic growth for more than a decade....We need to understand why employment is growing so slowly, particularly in the organized sector, and why employment in the informal sectors remains low quality, she said.



The meet will be attended by Mr Jose-Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, Executive Director of the ILO and Abhijit Sen, Member, Planning Commission, among others.



Noting that the 11th Plan aimed at ensuring faster growth, Salazar-Xirinachs said this is in line with the ILOs mandated goal of promoting decent work for all.

An ILO spokesperson said discussions at the meeting would cover possible policy responses in a number of areas. These include economic policies relating to macro-economics and specific sectors, labour market policies, skills development, and enterprise development, in particular in relation to micro and small enterprises.



Representatives of workers and employers, academics, central and state government officials, Planning Commission members and policy makers will also attend the meeting. PTI",https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/ilo-meet-on-employment-growth-in-india/6789,
"Absolute decline in jobs, says new EPW study, drop sharpest in last three years","There has been an absolute decline in employment ‚Äì number of people with jobs ‚Äì between 2013-14 and 2015-16, possibly for the first time since independence, a new study published in the EPW journal says. Three critical sources of jobs ‚Äì construction, manufacturing and IT services ‚Äì performed the worst, the paper by Vinoj Abraham of the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, said. The construction sector is India‚Äôs largest informal sector employer.

The author combined data sources from three flagship labour market surveys‚Äì The Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Surveys (LB-EUS) the Quarterly Quick Employment Surveys (QES) and the Revised QES‚Äì for recent periods to show that while there has been an absolute drop in the unorganized sector, in the organized sector, the rate of growth of employment has tanked.

In a novel technique, the author uses both Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Household Surveys and the Quarterly Employment Surveys of Enterprises to get ‚Äúevidence‚Äù from both ‚Äúsupply and demand side‚Äù. While ‚Äúdemand side‚Äù is a term economist use to denote employers, supply side refers to job-seekers.

According to the Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Surveys, total employment in the country shrank by about 0.4 per cent annually between 2013-14 and 2015-16 (going by the usual principal status criterion for those 15 years and above), a number which corresponds to 37.4 lakh people being unemployed. Usual principal status denotes a person who has been unemployed relatively for a longer period of time.

The study quotes the QES survey to state a ‚Äúdismal picture of employment creation in India‚Äù. After the October quarter in 2011, in no quarter were more than 2 lakh people employed. According to labour ministry data, nearly 12 million Indians enter the workforce in India every year. In three of the 12 quarters during 2014 and 2016, the situation worsened due to an ‚Äúabsolute decline in employment‚Äù.

The study states that the decline in job creation has been worst in the past three years. In the two years between March 2010 and March 2012, employment in the select sectors rose by 18.15 lakh, while in the next two years between March 2012 to March 2014, employment creation slowed down to just 6.2 lakh. In the following 19 months from March 2014 to December 2015, employment creation further slowed down to 5.92 lakh.

Between March 2014 and December 2015, average monthly employment creation declined to 30,000 jobs. And between March‚ÄìDecember 2015, the average employment creation fell to its worst levels: 8,000 jobs per month.

‚ÄúPerhaps this is for the first time in independent India that we have an absolute decline in employment,‚Äù Abraham writes.

Abraham also takes into account the organised and unorganized sectors. He says that the picture which emerges is one ‚Äúof an absolute decline of employment in India, with much of it probably in the unorganised sector, while the organised sector is seeing a sharp decline in the growth of employment.‚Äù

Abraham says India‚Äôs labour market is facing a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù with the employment rate stagnating across almost all sectors. Indicators have worsened since mid-2014 and the ‚Äúweakest among the working class are bearing the brunt of the employment decline,‚Äù the study said.",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/absolute-decline-in-jobs-says-new-epw-study-drop-sharpest-in-last-three-years/302513,
Amazon launches Military Veterans Employment programme in India,"New Delhi, Aug 26 (PTI) E-commerce major Amazon India on Monday said it has launched a Military Veterans Employment programme in the country that will create employment opportunities for military veterans and their spouses across the company''s fulfilment centres, sort centres and delivery centres in India.

"Modi Govt Causing 'Extreme Labour Exploitation, Harassment', Says RSS-Backed Trade Union","RSS-affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) will launch a nationwide agitation on September 6 against the Modi government's reforms that it says have led to ""extreme exploitation and harassment"" of the labour sector and led to increasing unemployment in the country.

CK Saji Narayanan, chief of one of the largest trade unions in the country, told IANS that they would stage protests in all the districts demanding among other things, scrapping of ""fixed-term employment"", which he said was ""destroying"" the labour sector.

""Because of these so-called reforms, contract labour has now become the default model of employment in India. Today 67% of the organised sector workers belong to this category. The trend of contract labour system has increased with the elimination of permanent posts in private and public entities as well as government departments,"" Narayanan said.

He said contract labour system had expanded rapidly creating shortage of permanent employees and making it a means of enhancing profit in the public sector.

""We tried reasoning with the Labour Ministry several times but to no avail. The fixed-term employment is not just leading to rapid expansion of contract labour but also resulting in increasing the number of new unemployed youth.

""Therefore, we have to stand up to face the Himalayan challenge to make contract labour exploitation free,"" said Narayanan, adding that the Sep 6 nationwide agitation was only the beginning of a long haul fight to address the issue of rampant labour exploitation in the country.

The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government had first allowed hiring fixed-term workers in 2003. This was scrapped in 2007 by the Congress-led UPA in 2007 following intense protests by trade unions.

After coming to power, the Modi government in April 2015 again mooted the concept by issuing draft rules for amending the Industrial Establishment (Standing Order). But the move was deferred following opposition from trade unions.

Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech this year announced extending the facility of fixed term employment applicable only in the apparel manufacturing sector to all sectors.

Subsequently the Central government in March notified amending the Industrial Establishment (Standing Order) 1946 to extend the facility of hiring workers on fixed-term employment to all sectors.

Under the rules, a ""fixed-term employment"" workman is one who has been engaged on the basis of a written contract of employment for a fixed period.

The new rules, which provide that a temporary workman can be terminated without being given any notice of termination, has been widely condemned by all trade unions and they have been demanding its rollback.

The BMS has been vociferous in deriding the government's labour and economic policies and stridently opposed many of the labour reforms which it says has led to ""continuous unrest among contract workers and increase in breakdown of industrial peace"".

Apprehensive that the prevailing situation may lead to creation of ""new conditions of bonded labour"", the BMS, at its recently concluded National Executive Committee Meeting, adopted a resolution seeking immediate steps from the Centre to prevent open violations of labour laws.

""Incidents in Maruti Udyog at Manesar, Hyundai and Honda industries are vivid examples of the intense labour unrest. There is huge resentment among the entire labour sector. Unless steps are taken to resolve the issues, the situation will only worsen,"" warned Narayanan.

Highlighting the plight of contract labour, the BMS said these workers were denied any social security, pension, medical benefits, gratuity and leave. Besides being paid one-fourth of a permanent worker's wage, they were even denied minimum wages especially in the non-scheduled employment.

The BMS wants regularization of contract labour, amendment of relevant laws to secure ""equal pay for similar work"" and ensuring that contract workers were paid perks that permanent employees get.

CCU to hire 2000 employees in India and overseas,"New Delhi [India], Jan 30 (ANI): In a move to provide additional avenues for employment, Critical Care Unified (CCU), a home health care start-up providing comprehensive services for critical care at home, is coming up with an employment drive. The company is gearing up to cross revenues of Rs five crores in 2018, while seeking funding up-to Rs. 40 crores in this quarter.

The organization plans to hire 2000 employees to supplement the expansion plans in India and overseas, thereby creating an upsurge of interest in the home-care sector.

Critical Care Unified has an aggressive-yet-stregically-sorted plan of expansion, infiltrating into about 10 cities in India. International plans are also strengthening as an aim to expand to four territories.

""Our emphasis on customer satisfaction and quality service, embodied in the mantra, 'Compassion with a Passion' is paying rich dividends, as we are running our business with positive growth in revenue, along with profitability, from the very first month. This expansion will create larger opportunities for patients to acquire affordable and rapid services at the comfort of their home,"" said founder, Critical Care Unified, Rajiv Mathur.

RSS Trade Union Slams Govt Notification That Will End Permanent Employment In All Sectors,"RSS trade union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has called for an immediate withdrawal of central government‚Äôs new notification allowing fixed term employment, which will make ‚Äúhire and fire‚Äù legal in the labour sector.

In a press statement , BMS President, Saji Narayanan C.K, also accused that none of the objections raised by BMS was accepted by the Government.

As per the new notification issued by the labour ministry, the government had extended the facility of hiring workers on fixed term employment to all sectors. In his Budget speech earlier last month, Finance Ministry Arun Jaitley had said, ""the facility of fixed term employment will be extended to all sectors"".

Narayanan said, ‚ÄúIn 2003 the Vajpeyee Government brought fixed term employment. But the UPA government on seeing protests by Trade Unions, withdrew the controversial amendment. But again the present Government has brought it to made-up sectors, apparel and food processing. Now it is extended to all sectors.‚Äù

Taking on the government, the BMS said, ‚ÄúBy this notification, permanent employment will vanish from the industrial sector and all jobs will be converted into temporary contract works for a fixed period only,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIt is also highly objectionable that, a fixed term contract can be even cancelled by the employer unilaterally by giving only two weeks‚Äô notice.‚Äù

The BMS demanded that instead of bringing this notification thegovernment should stop the increasing contractualisation in permanent jobs in the country. It also accused that the Finance Minister has violated the ILO convention 144 on Trade Union Consultation which was ratified by the Indian Parliament, when he unilaterally declared that the fixed term employment will be implemented.

It said the Government did not properly conduct several rounds of consultation with Trade Unions. The amendment is brought in a hasty way.

‚ÄúThis is a backdoor method of Bureaucrats taking up the legislative power enjoyed by the parliament on matters of National importance. The amendment is brought about under pressure from a powerful Industrial lobby,‚Äù said Narayanan.",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/rss-trade-union-slams-govt-notification-that-will-end-permanent-employment-in-al/309782,
''Women entrepreneurship can create 150-170 mn jobs in India'',"''Women entrepreneurship can create 150-170 mn jobs in India''

New Delhi, Feb 18 (IANS) Women in entrepreneurship can generate transformational employment in India and generate 150-170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population by 2030, a new report said on Tuesday.

A joint report by Bain & Company and Google titled ""Women Entrepreneurship in India - Powering the economy with her"", underlines the need to accelerate efforts to grow women entrepreneurs in India in both quantity and quality to solve employment challenges in the country.

""In spite of India''s economic progress in the last decade, women''s participation in the labour force has declined and is expected to be under pressure due to labour trends, technological disruption and constraining social barriers,"" said lead author Megha Chawla, Partner, Bain & Company.

""Unlocking entrepreneurship amongst women in India is a complex effort, but it provides an unprecedented opportunity to change the economic and social trajectory of India and its women for generations to come,"" Chawla added.

""This will drive tremendous job creation and also deliver transformational social and personal outcomes for women,"" she added.

The report identified six dominant segments of women entrepreneurs and estimates India to have 13.5-15.7 million women-owned enterprises, representing approximately 20 per cent of all enterprises today.

In many cases, women are named as owners for financial and administrative reasons with no active role to play, which overstates true entrepreneurship amongst women.

Of all women-owned enterprises, a majority are single person enterprises, with the largest group represented by rural non-farm home-based business owners at 38 per cent, followed by urban self-employed women solopreneurs at 31 per cent, who usually work from home.

According to the study, the other dominant segments include rural agripreneurs who are farm-based business owners at 18 per cent and small business owners at 14 per cent - split across urban (6 per cent) and rural (8 per cent) - employing less than 10 employees and contributing most to employment generation.

Finally, there are the scalers, who employ more than 10 people and account for less than one per cent.

In total, these women entrepreneurs provide direct employment to an estimated 22 to 27 million people today.

The report projects an opportunity to accelerate both quantity and quality of entrepreneurship to create over 30 million women-owned enterprises out of which 12 million can generate employment.

""At Google we have been investing in scaled skilling efforts across SMBs, Startups and overcoming the digital gender gap in the country through the Internet Saathi program. Across all our programs, we have seen that women are hungry for opportunities to grow their household incomes,"" said Sapna Chadha, Senior Country Marketing Director, Google India and Southeast Asia.

""Hundreds of women in rural India want to learn more about doing business and many have already made the start to enhance their livelihoods. We are already running a pilot accelerator program for rural entrepreneurs from our Internet Saathi network,"" Chadha added.

According to Chadha, this joint effort report with Bain is a start to better understand the barriers facing the various types of women entrepreneurs across India and find synergies with like-minded companies and the government to accelerate women entrepreneurship in the country.

HC raps US citizen for overstaying in India,"Mumbai, Aug 26 (PTI) Reprimanding a US citizen who has challenged his deportation from India, the Bombay High Court said on Monday the petitioner could not claim an entitlement to stay in the country just because he is from the United States.

""You accept there was a breach of your visa terms, then how can you claim an entitlement to stay in India?"" the high court asked.

""What is so special about an American coming to India? Just because you are a US citizen, do you think you can come and do any jugaad (a flexible or innovative approach to problem solving) in this country?"" it said.

""India is a great country for condoning. Everyone has a right here but no one has any responsibility,"" the HC remarked.

The observations came from a bench of justices S C Dharmadhikari and G S Patel while hearing a petition filed by 29-year-old Joshua Sadagursky.

Sadagursky was deported from the Mumbai airport in May 2018 after the authorities realised that he had breached his previous visa terms by overstaying in India and by taking up an employment in the country though his visa did not grant such a permission.

During his last visit to India between 2017 and 2018, he had overstayed and delayed approaching the Foreigner Regional Registration Offices concerned after his visa expired.

Sadagursky, who is now in the US and has not returned to India since, filed a plea in the high court challenging his deportation.

In his plea filed through his counsel Birendra Saraf, he argued that his deportation was ""arbitrary"" and he wasn''t granted a fair hearing.

The petitioner also argued that he merely worked for an NGO in India and taught underprivileged children here, and therefore, such an engagement could not be considered as employment.

The court, however, remained unimpressed with the argument.

Referring to his working with the NGO, the court said, ""So what? You are not doing any great service to India. You were in breach of your visa regulations.""

The bench noted that Sadagursky had also overstayed in India on a previous occasion in 2012.

""Can anyone do this in America? You try going to JFK after overstaying and seek a hearing. They will immediately put you on a plane and send you back to your country,"" the high court said.

The court has reserved its verdict on Sadagursky''s plea and will pass its orders in the coming weeks. PTI AYA GK IJT

Driving employment in real estate: Square Yards ramps up its workforce to over 2000,"New Delhi [India], Aug 9 (ANI): At a time when the employment scenario in the start-up eco-system and the realm of real estate is slowing down, Square Yards, the leading tech-backed transaction and aggregation platform for global real estate has succeeded in expanding its workforce at a phenomenal pace.

It has recently crossed 2,000 employees headcount, out of which around 85 percent are direct sales workforce, placing its real estate sales headcount over the largest of real estate developers, online and offline aggregators in India.

Moreover, around 10 percent of these employees are based in International locations, giving the company an unparalleled last mile International distribution reach.

Buoyed by its impressive country-wide and global expansion, Square Yards is enhancing its employee base by 10 percent month-on-month. It now has presence in over 40 Indian cities, across metros and tier II geographies as well as nine other countries besides India.

This rapid expansion spree along with the attractive career acceleration opportunities it offers to its employees has fuelled its growth tremendously as a company.

""Real estate is still not considered as the top choice for ambitious sales professionals in the Indian eco-system. However, at Square Yards we have been able to disrupt this scheme of things to a large extent. Today, we are able to attract and retain top talent from not only real estate but diversified industry verticals such as insurance, telecom and retail. A blend of superlative incentive structures and international opportunities is what has helped us making real estate sales job attractive, lucrative and fulfilling and is sure to propel us on an evolved growth trajectory,"" said founder and CEO Square Yards, Tanuj Shori.

Besides on the business side, Square Yards has managed to beat the overall industry average as well. It clocks 1,000+ real estate transactions and another 600+ of loan transactions each month and its annual revenue run rate stands at an impressive USD 30 million.

It dominates most of the Indian markets it operates in while it has already gained a virtual monopoly in major NRI markets across the world. Through its scale, Square Yards has created a platform that not only attracts customers, but also developers, real estate professionals, independent financial agents, business professionals, freelancers and financial institutions.

Square Yards has pioneered a unique online-to- offline (O2O) approach for customer acquisition and service delivery in real estate and it offers a perfect blend of advantages of both channels - the convenience of online-based rich research and data-driven insights and the assurance of a designated salesperson who assists the customer in property research, coordinates site visits, and helps in closing the deal with the developer.

Its sales advisors are able to convince the clients by virtue of their market knowledge, ability to do need based evaluation and many other ways in which they can connect the various dots along the bridge between developers and buyers. (ANI)

"Modi Government First In India's History To Manipulate Data, Says Yashwant Sinha After NSSO Report","Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Thursday hit out at the Modi government over non-disclosure of the the National Statistical Commission (NSC) report that claimed that the unemployment rate was at the highest in last 45 years and said that it was a ""very serious"" issue as it was for the first time in the country's history that a government ""is interfering and manipulating data"".

He said with resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), the body has become defunct because it has only two official members and ex-officials have left.

""This (non-disclosure of the report) is a very serious issue for at least those who understand that this is the first time in our history that a government is interfering with and manipulating data. And the latest is the most shoddy example of this,"" he told IANS in an interview.

His remarks came after the report, which the government had withheld from being released and accessed by Business Standard newspaper, said the unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, post-demonetisation, and was at its highest level since 1972-73 -- the period since when the jobs data is comparable.

NSC acting chief P.C. Mohanan and his colleague J. Meenakshi, who were unhappy over the non-publication of the job data that had been due for release in December last year, resigned in protest on Tuesday.

Sinha said even before this NSC controversy, the country saw the ""spectacle"" of the back series growth rates where the government appointed the Committee under Sudipto Mondal who is an expert to work out the back series.

""And when they worked out the GDP growth series, which showed that UPA had done better than the present regime, then it was withdrawn. And the NITI Aayog, which has nothing to do with data and statistics, was asked to study those figures.

He alleged that the NITI Aayog then ""revised these figures, manipulated those figures and came out with other set of figures which showed that starting with the (former Prime Minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee years and under this government India has recorded highest growth rate in the five years of this government"". They did not beleive it,"" he said.

Referring to the unemployement issue, he said first it was demonetisation followed by a ""flawed"" goods and services tax that had a ""tremendous impact"" on the economy especially on the agriculture, the informal sector like construction and the MSME sectors. ""These three sectors were very badly hit, not so much like the corporate organised sector.""

He said specialised centres of production such as Noida, Tirupur, Agra and many such centres spread across the country had to retrench labour because it was not worthwhile for them to carry out business they were doing and many of these people who were employed went home.

""We had an anecdotal evidence but there were no hard evidence which would have been collected to prove the point. So, the government kept on challenging us and saying that it is not true,"" he said.

Sinha said that other anecdotal evidence which was available was the budgetary allocation for MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act).

""The budgetary allocation went up from Rs 55,000 crore to almost Rs 65,000 crore and even that was inadequate to meet the demands. So why did the demand under MGNREGA suddenly go up? Because people went back home and were prepared to work as manual labourers and earn something,"" he said.

Sinha said all their arguments were rejected by the government. ""They kept telling people that everything was fine until this data came. Now, quite clearly, this has demolished the government's case of employment generation and presented a very, very dismal picture.""

Referring to the leaked report of NSC, he said that despite labour participation in the market delcining over the years, ""even then we have a picture where it has gone up to 6.1 per cent joblessness"" and it ""confirms the story that this Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy had come out with a report saying that there was a loss of 11 million jobs in 2018 alone.

""This is the reason why the government did not allow this data to come out, which led to the resignation of the only two official members in the Statistical Commission.""

Sinha said the NSC was set up during ther early UPA (United Progressive Alliance)-I years.

""When I was the Finance Minister I was not satisfied with the way data was collected. We appointed an expert Committee under Rangarajan to study the whole system of data collection, storage, dissemination in our country and suggest the steps to suit the whole system. He gave his report, then this report was studied by the government and finally this NSC was set up, from where these two members have resigned.

He also said that the Labour Bureau, which publishes quarterly data of employment generation, was stopped from doing that work.

Sinha also said that the Standing Committee of Finance had asked for a report from Ministry of Agriculture on impact of demonetisation on agriculture.

Women entrepreneurs can generate 150-170 mn jobs in India: Report,"New Delhi, Feb 18 (PTI) Women in entrepreneurship can generate transformational employment in India and generate 150‚Äì170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population by 2030, a joint report by Bain & Company and Google said on Tuesday.

India has 13.5‚Äì15.7 million women-owned enterprises, representing 20 per cent of all enterprises in the country, the report titled ''Women Entrepreneurship in India ‚Äì Powering the economy with her'' said.

The report said a number of enterprises reported as women-owned are not in fact controlled or run by women and a combination of financial and administrative reasons lead to women being ""on paper"" owners with little role to play.

Accelerating quantity and quality of entrepreneurship towards benchmarks from high-performing countries and Indian states can create over 30 million women-owned enterprises, of which 40 per cent (12 million) can generate employment, the report said.

""This can generate potentially transformational employment in India, of 150‚Äì170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population, from now until 2030,"" it added.

Of all women-owned enterprises, a majority are single-person enterprises with the largest group represented by rural non-farm home-based business owners at 38 per cent, followed by urban self-employed women ""solo-preneurs"" at 31 per cent who usually work from home.

The other dominant segments include rural ""agri-preneurs"" who are farm-based business owners (18 per cent) and small business owners at 14 per cent ‚Äî split across urban (6 per cent) and rural (8 per cent).

In total, these women entrepreneurs provide direct employment to an estimated 22 to 27 million people currently, the report said.

In spite of India''s economic progress in the last decade, women''s participation in the labour force has declined and is expected to be under pressure due to labour trends, technological disruption and constraining social barriers, Megha Chawla, Partner at Bain & Company, and the lead author of the report, said.

""Unlocking entrepreneurship among women in India is a complex effort but it provides an unprecedented opportunity to change the economic and social trajectory of India and its women for generations to come,"" she added.

This will drive tremendous job creation and also deliver transformational social and personal outcomes for women, Chawla said.

Google India and Southeast Asia Senior Country Marketing Director Sapna Chadha said the company has been investing in skilling efforts across small and medium businesses, start-ups and overcoming digital gender gap in the country through its Internet Saathi programme.

""Across all our programmes, we have seen that women are hungry for opportunities to grow their household incomes. Hundreds of women in rural India want to learn more about doing business and many have already made the start to enhance their livelihoods,"" she said.

The report outlined opportunity areas to unlock women entrepreneurship in India. It suggested that level-playing field for high-impact, employment-creating entrepreneurs be provided and expanding the funnel to get more women to start enterprises.

It also recommended that steps be taken to build, strengthen and scale productive rural ""agri-preneurs"".

""Implementing these interventions to accelerate prospective and current women entrepreneurs will need a deep recognition of the urgency, and a multi-year coordinated scaled effort between various ecosystem participants,"" Sri Rajan, partner at Bain & Company, and co-author of the report, said.

These participants include national and state governments, grassroot organisations, investment and banking communities, other private enterprises, educational institutions and media.

The report said that of the about 432 million working-age women in India, about 343 million are not in paid formal work.

An estimated 324 million of these women are not in the labour force and another 19 million are in the labour force but not employed, it said.

By 2030, India''s working-age population will surpass an unprecedented 1 billion, and up to 400 million women''s economic potential may be left unaddressed, it added.

""India needs to take a non-traditional approach. In addition to job creation by private and government sectors, entrepreneurship is a powerful, and largely untapped, opportunity for working-age women in India,"" the report said.

By creating jobs, fuelling innovation and furthering investment in health and education, entrepreneurship among women could transform of India''s economy and society, it said. PTI SR HRS

Unprecedented employment opportunities in India today: Modi,"Surat (Gujrat), Oct 25 (PTI) Citing disbursal of loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna (PMMY), Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday said ""unprecedented"" employment and entrepreneurial opportunities exist in the country today.

Modi addressed the employees of Hari Krishna Exports, a prominent Suarat-based diamond processing-exporting firm, through video conference from Delhi.

The company, led by Savji Dholakia, gifted 600 cars to its employees Thursday as Diwali bonus at an event named as 'Hari Krishna Skill India Incentive Ceremony'.

""Around 14 crore loans were disbursed across the country under this (Mudra) scheme. Out of these, 40 lakh loans were given to the youth of Gujarat. In the last four years, loans worth Rs 7 lakh crore were disbursed under this scheme,"" Modi said in his speech.

""Out of all those who took loans under Mudra, over 3.5 crore youth were first-time entrepreneurs, as they have chosen the path of self-employment for the first time. Today, there exist unprecedented employment as well as entrepreneurial opportunities in the country,"" the prime minister said.

Two women, one of them a disabled person, and two male employees of the firm received keys of their cars from Modi himself in Delhi.

The prime minister said his government has been taking many steps to strengthen the gems and jewellery sector, as it is a significant generator of employment and a key contributor to the exports.

Referring to the ""Main Nahin Hum"" portal and app launched yesterday, Modi urged the company and its employees to dedicate some time for social causes.

He appealed Dholakia and his company to set themselves a target of making at least 100 villages ""digital"" by 2022.

He would be visiting Gujarat on October 31 to dedicate the Statue of Unity of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Modi said.

""The biggest Diwali for Gujarat will be on October 31, when the Statue of Unity will be dedicated to the nation,"" he said. PTI CORR PJT PD KRK MKJ

Benefits of AI on employment outweigh concerns: Report,"New Delhi, Feb 15 (PTI) The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment is expected to be severe, but the benefits outweigh its concerns as it would lead to improved efficiency and cost saving, says a PwC India report.

According to the report titled ""Artificial Intelligence- Hype or Reality"", about 68 per cent of Indian business decision-makers believe AI will help their business in various ways such as boosting productivity, generating growth and addressing societal issues.

""While 65 per cent of participants agreed that AI is likely to have a severe impact on employment in India, a majority believed the benefits outweigh any employment concerns as AI will open up opportunities for people to do more value-added work, apart from allowing for greater flexibility and work-life balance,"" the report said.

Given that AI integration requires significant time and investment, the report also suggests that organisations would do well to prioritise those areas that could be automated with relative ease and with ready availability of data.

Moreover, companies should also focus those areas which would provide the most tangible and immediate returns in terms of improved efficiency, cost savings and customer reach.

""While AI holds the potential to truly transform our lives as individuals and enterprises, its growth and adoption are wholly dependent on overcoming challenges related to reducing costs, securing the right talent and data, and addressing concerns around privacy and trust,"" said Sudipta Ghosh, Partner and Leader, Data & Analytics, PwC India.

Ghosh further said ""the market reality we exist in today demands that we not only work towards upskilling our people, but also produce the smartest machines that can work with us"".

"Modi's Make In India, Other Schemes Mere 'Jumla': Sitaram Yechury","CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Monday alleged investments and exports in the manufacturing sector have dropped sharply in the past five years, terming the government's flagship 'Make in India' programme a ""Jumla"" (rhetoric).

The 'Make in India' programme was also criticised by political leaders after the Vande Bharat Express, India's first semi high-speed train, broke down on Saturday while returning to the capital from Varanasi, a day after it was launched.

The locomotive-less train, previously known as Train18, was manufactured under the ambitious scheme by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai.

""Modi's 'Make in India', like all his other schemes, has turned out to be a jumla and PR. Investment, employment, and exports in India's manufacturing sector have all declined sharply in the past five years,"" Yechury said on Twitter.

He said agricultural, manufacturing, employment and income growth are at a low under this government.

""Agricultural growth low, manufacturing growth low, employment growth low, income growth low... all things that matter to Indians are going lower under Modi. The only thing going up is the PR budget of Modi and jumlas from his speeches, as his cronies loot the banks,"" he said.

He alleged that the top ""12 crony businessmen friends of this govt owe public money which is TWICE the entire farm loan waiver!""

""Yet, Modi govt has been happy to waive off over 3 lakh crore of unpaid loans of friends and allowed looters to scoot. Nothing for farmers facing an unprecedented crisis,"" the CPI(M) general secretary further said.

""A political ideology which divides Indians and pitches one Indian against another is truly 'anti-national'. We all know who the proponents and leaders of that political ideology are, in our country,"" he alleged.

93% of H-4 approved work authorisation from India: US report,"By Lalit K Jha

Washington, May 11 (PTI) A staggering 93 per cent of the total H-4 visa holders in the US having work authorisation are from India, a latest Congressional report on the spouse visa has said.

Over one-fifth of the H-4 visa holders with work authorisation live in California, it said.

Ninety-three per cent of granted applications for employment authorisation were issued to women; seven per cent to men, according to the report on H-4 visas by the independent Congressional Research Service of the US Congress, which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest to US lawmakers.

""Ninety-three per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and five per cent were issued to individuals born in China. Individuals born in all other countries combined make up the remaining two per cent of approved applications,"" CRS said in its nine-page report.

As of December 25, 2017, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had approved 126,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders. These count all approvals since May 2015 when the rule was implemented.

This number includes 90,946 initial approvals, 35,219 renewals, and 688 replacements for lost cards.

H-4 visa holders are not geographically constrained by law, and approvals for employment authorisation documents have been issued to H-4 non-immigrants living in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories.

California accounts for more than one-fifth (28,033), and Texas and New Jersey together account for another 20 per cent.

Before 2015, H-4 visa holders were not eligible for work authorisation.

As the visa queue increased for individuals in particular those from India and China awaiting employment-based legal permanent resident (LPR) status, policymakers and others raised concerns about the lack of employment authorisation for spouses hindering the US' ability to attract and retain highly educated workers.

In 2015 Federal Register issued a notice establishing work authorisation for certain H-4 spouses referred to three anticipated benefits: reducing personal and financial burdens on H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants, reducing disruption to the US businesses and attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers.

The previous Obama administration argued that allowing H-4 spouses to work would support the US economy because H-1B non-immigrants and their spouses have historically made significant contributions to entrepreneurship and research and development.

Finally, this rule may facilitate attracting and retaining highly skilled workers by bringing US immigration policies more in line with those of other countries that compete for similarly skilled workers, it said.

Unlike work authorisation for H-1B visa holders, employment authorisation that is granted based on H-4 status is not restricted to a specific employer and does not require the employer to get approval from the Department of Labour.

H-4 work authorisation also does not prohibit self-employment, starting a business, or hiring employees.

However, under its America First Policy, the Trump administration is proposing to remove from regulation H-4 spouses of H-1B non-immigrants as a class of foreign nationals eligible for employment authorisation.

The result would be that H-4 visa holders would not have authorisation to work in the US.

The administration anticipates publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register in June 2018, which would be followed by a public comment period before a final rule would be published, CRS said.

While H-4 EADs have been issued to residents of almost 4,000 cities across the US, CRS said the cities with the highest numbers are around large ""tech hubs"" such as the Silicon Valley, northern New Jersey, Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, the Washington, DC, region and Atlanta.

CRS said Congress has considered several related pieces of legislation.

The Immigration Innovation Act of 2018 (S.2344), as introduced in the 115th Congress, would codify the current regulation providing work authorisation to H-4 spouses of certain H-1B non-immigrants and would require the employer of the H-4 spouse to attest that they will pay her or him the greater of the prevailing wage for that occupation in the area of employment or the actual wage paid to other workers in the same job with similar qualifications (i.E., applying the same pay standard to the hiring of H-4 visa holders as is applied to their H-1B spouses).

Previous versions of this bill (S.153, as introduced in the 114th Congress, and S.169, as introduced in the 113th Congress) would have provided employment authorisation to the spouse of any H-1B or L (intra-company transferee) non-immigrant, regardless of whether the H-1B or L non-immigrant had begun the process of obtaining LPR status.

These bills would not have required labour attestation.

Likewise, immigration reform bills in the 113th Congress (S.744, as passed by the Senate, and HR 15, as introduced) would have provided employment authorisation to the spouse of any H1B or L non-immigrant, regardless of whether the H-1B or L non-immigrant had begun the process of obtaining LPR status.

"Swedish biz delegation to focus on investment, employment opportunities during India visit","New Delhi, Dec 1 (PTI) A high-level delegation comprising of over 100 business leaders from Swedish companies like ABB, Ikea, Ericsson and Volvo is accompanying the King and Queen of Sweden during their six-day official visit to India beginning Sunday.

Giving details about the visit, Anders Wickberg, Swedish Trade Commissioner to India, said the delegation will hold meetings with Indian industry leaders in Delhi as well as Mumbai.

He said the visit is likely to generate high quality investments in the country which in turn will create technology transfer and employment opportunities.

Currently, over 200 Swedish companies are operating in India, employing over 2 lakh people.

In the last two years, employment through Swedish companies and investment have grown at over 20 per cent, Wickberg said.

The business delegation will be in India in conjunction with the state visit of Sweden''s King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, he said.

India is Sweden''s third largest trade partner in Asia, after China and Japan. Mutual economic interests in areas including manufacturing, cleantech, and healthcare, among others, are driving trade relations between both the countries, he said.

Moreover, there has been an influx of Swedish retail companies, with Ikea and H&M pursuing rapid expansion both online and offline, Wickberg said, adding that media services provider Spotify too recently established its presence in India.

Ikea, which has a store in Hyderabad, plans to open 20-25 more stores in the country, he added.

During Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s visit to Stockholm in 2018, a Joint Action Plan as well as a Joint Declaration on Sweden-India Innovation Partnership for a sustainable future were signed.

This, Wickberg said, is set to deepen bilateral ties in the field of innovation, underpinning a mutual commitment to drive prosperity and address global challenges such as climate change and sustainable development through innovation.

""With this commitment, we work to increase our bilateral impact, and strive to build on joint solutions,"" he added.

With this visit of high-level business delegation, both the countries hope to strengthen their ties and focus on furthering the partnership, specifically in the areas of collaboration and co-creation such as innovation and sustainability, he said.

The delegation''s programme includes a number of networking sessions, panel discussions and roundtable meetings that will facilitate knowledge transfer and experience sharing, Wickberg said. PTI NKD CS RR RVK

ISF organizes conference on future of employment to re-engineer employment ecosystem,"New Delhi [India], June 14 (ANI): Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), an apex body of flexi staffing industry in India, today organizes 11th National Employment Conference themed 'Future of Employment'.

Experts from the government, employment industry, education fraternity and corporates participated in this event. They discussed the present employment ecosystem, mapped it against the future trends, identified future jobs and skill requirements and proposed a way to re-engineer the ecosystem. With the current fall in jobs between April and December 2016 where India just created 2.31 lakhs jobs (according to government's labor survey) these initiatives are most welcomed to streamline the roadmap for skilling and creating more employment opportunities.

Today's job market is witnessing changes at a rapid pace than earlier as the trends of digitalization and automation are affecting the core functioning of organizations. As per the recent report by Indian Staffing Federation only 15 major sectors drove the entire jobs market growth only in 11 states which is comparatively less in a country like India.

Every year 12 million workforce are added and five million people look out of agriculture for new job opportunities which means we need to have 70 to 80 million jobs per year. Thus, the need of the hour is to welcome other forms of employment which will help make people employable. Flexi staffing is integral hence. In the IT industry itself, despite lay-offs on the surge, flexi hiring is likely to grow 53 percent in IT sector by 2018 as staffing players know inside out and can help meet the existing skill gap of the IT industry.

""While further discussing on the future trends of employment, Rituparna Chakraborty, President, Indian Staffing Federation, said, ""The Future of employment is not jobs but creating an ecosystem which enables our youth to create their own work. In the long run the narrative shall shift away from permanent jobs vs temporary jobs, formal jobs vs informal jobs to a job of dignity irrespective of the form of employment,"" said president Indian Staffing Federation, Rituparna Chakraborty.

""Today, we are entering into a new era where shapes of enterprises and livelihoods are undergoing massive transformation which makes embracing lifelong learning an imperative towards ensuring sustainability. Despite the current layoffs and negativity in certain sectors, Indian jobs market seems to look positive in sectors like IT, Startups, Telecom and BPO and blue collar roles will gain prominence in these. It's important for businesses and industries not to find themselves blindfolded and hence we need to show up prepared to be ahead of the employment renaissance,"" added Chakraborty.

On the side lines of the conference, ISF also spearheads first-of-its-kind initiative called Staffing Mentorship Programme for the larger interest of the staffing industry. Twelve top staffing companies in India engage in one-on-one sessions with interested participants on their respective domains of interest and discuss the challenges of staffing business while identifying new growth areas.

62% Indians more satisfied with work conditions: survey,"Mumbai, Apr 19 (PTI) Employees in India, 62 per cent, are far more satisfied with their work conditions compared to those in Asia Pacific, as per a survey.

The 'Michael Page's 'Job Confidence Index Q1 2017' (January-March period), revealed that 62 per cent Indian employees are 'satisfied or very satisfied' with their working conditions compared to 53 per cent of employees in Asia Pacific.

However, in a city to city comparison in India, a number of major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai, slipped in their work satisfaction rating during the first quarter this year compared to the last quarter of 2016, it said.

The Job Confidence Index Q1 2017, analysed the responses of 650 professionals in India and 4,700 across Asia Pacific.

It revealed that the three chief objectives for seeking employment in India remained unchanged, where 48 per cent of individuals aspire to acquire new skills, 39 per cent yearn for better work-life balance and 34 per cent consider income a significant factor.

Employees in India were more positive about work-life balance in the next 12 months (56 per cent compared to 55 per cent in Q4 2016) and development of new skills (85 per cent compared to 81 per cent in Q4 2016), it said.

While job hunting in India, better work-life balance (39 per cent) has surpassed salary (34 per cent) as the second most important factor.

""The Indian government has taken numerous initiatives to accelerate the economy through various sector focused initiatives. A robust demand for qualified professionals in a competitive market has resulted in the importance of skill enhancement among millennials,"" Michael Page India Managing Director Nicolas Dumoulin said.

India sees rise in solar photovoltaic jobs: IRENA,"New Delhi, June 13 (IANS) India saw expand in solar photovoltaic employment in 2018, while China, the US, Japan and the European Union lost jobs, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said on Thursday.

In total, 11 million people were employed in renewable energy worldwide in 2018, up from 10.3 million in 2017.

As more and more countries manufacture, trade and install renewable energy technologies, IRENA's latest 'Renewable Energy and Jobs -- Annual Review' finds renewables jobs grew to their highest level despite slower growth in key renewable energy markets, including China.

The diversification of the renewable energy supply chain is changing the sector's geographic footprint.

Until now, renewable energy industries have remained relatively concentrated in a handful of major markets, such as China, the US and the European Union.

Increasingly, however, East and Southeast Asian countries have emerged alongside China as key exporters of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels.

Countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, were responsible for a greater share of growth in renewables jobs last year, which allowed Asia to maintain a 60 per cent share of renewable energy jobs worldwide.

""Beyond climate goals, governments are prioritising renewables as a driver of low-carbon economic growth in recognition of the numerous employment opportunities created by the transition to renewables,"" said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

""Renewables deliver on all main pillars of sustainable development -- environmental, economic and social. As the global energy transformation gains momentum, this employment dimension reinforces the social aspect of sustainable development and provides yet another reason for countries to commit to renewables.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind remain the most dynamic of all renewable energy industries.

Accounting for one-third of the total renewable energy workflow, solar PV retains the top spot in 2018, ahead of liquid biofuels, hydropower and wind power.

Geographically, Asia hosts over three million PV jobs, nearly nine-tenths of the global total.

Most of the wind industry's activity still occurs on land and is responsible for the bulk of the sector's 1.2 million jobs.

China alone accounts for 44 per cent of global wind employment, followed by Germany and the US.

Offshore wind could be an especially attractive option for leveraging domestic capacity and exploiting synergies with the oil and gas industry.

The solar PV industry retains the top spot, with a third of the total renewable energy workforce.

Besides India, PV employment expanded in Southeast Asia and Brazil, while China, the US, Japan and the European Union lost jobs.

Rising output pushed biofuel jobs up six per cent to 2.1 million.

Brazil, Colombia, and Southeast Asia have labour-intensive supply chains where informal work is prominent, whereas operations in the US and the European Union are far more mechanised.

Employment in wind power supports 1.2 million jobs.

Onshore projects predominate, but the offshore segment is gaining traction and could build on expertise and infrastructure in the offshore oil and gas sector.

Hydropower has the largest installed capacity of all renewables but is now expanding slowly.

The sector employs 2.1 million people directly, three quarters of whom are in operations and maintenance.

"Capgemini to hire up to 30,000 employees in India this year","Capgemini to hire up to 30,000 employees in India this year

Mumbai, Mar 1 (PTI) French tech major Capgemini, which employs close to 1.15 lakh people in India, is looking to hire up to 30,000 employees in the country this year, as it seeks to derive more value from its presence here.

The hiring will be evenly split between freshers and experienced professionals, or laterals, its country chief executive Ashwin Yardi told PTI.

The Indian workforce constitutes for over half of its global employees base.

""India forms a very important part of our business and we will hire 25,000-30,000 people here this year on a gross basis,"" Yardi said.

At present, it is focusing efforts on re-skilling employees for the technologies of the future, he said, adding that this has now become a continuous process.

It has been found that youngsters under 30, who make up for over 65 per cent of its workforce, show a keenness to learn, he said, adding that it is conducting special programmes for the mid-level managers having 10-15 years of experience who would be placed as project managers or architects.

Yardi said there has not been any ""restructuring or involuntary attrition"" beyond the normal course of exits due to performance-related issues.

Clients have become more demanding, wherein employees have to be moved into a project on an immediate basis, Yardi said, adding that the utilisation levels have not been because the training and skilling activities take place along side project work for an employee.

He said there is sufficient space at Airoli (near Mumbai), its biggest development centre, and also added that it has created capacity at other centres over the last two years which can accommodate the new joinees.

At a time when some of its peers are laying a lot of stress on research and development activities and are filing for patents, the company has taken a call not to do ''blue sky thinking'' and adopt the ""applied innovation"" concept to come up with client specific improvements, he said.

The company is also not keen to play on the products front and is happy being a services company, he said. It can be noted that many IT companies are focusing on products, and claim that it helps them maintain or widen profit margins.

The French company is also not investing in startups unlike some peers, but working jointly with over 150 of them on critical technologies, Yardi said.

He said the company believes in offering an entire bouquet of services to a client to meet the entire spectrum of needs, and discloses the work done by a startup to the client.

It has also hired a chief innovation officer from a startup recently, he said. PTI AA DRR

US based ITBD commits employment of 200 Indian IT professionals,"New Delhi [India], Sept 5 (ANI): A US based global IT infrastructure support ITBD has expanded its operations in India, post Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States in June, providing employment opportunities to more than 200 skilled IT professionals.

Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Minister of State (MoS) in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, on Monday inaugurated the new office of ITBD in Noida.

""Prime Minister Modi is a great visionary who started various programmes and schemes to make India the most favourable nation for global businesses and investors. India's efforts in reforming the taxation and licensing policies are well appreciated by economists all over the world, and we are keen to pursue our commitments,"" Rathore asserted.

Delighted to see the overwhelming audience at the inauguration ceremony, CEO ITBD, Sunny Kaila said that ITBD's expansion in India reaffirms the commitment to grow with India, and choose it as a top ITBD FDI strategy, even during the harsh political climate created under the Trump Administration.

The company has invested two million US dollars. The Noida expansion assures immediate hiring of more than 200 IT professionals, including infrastructure engineers, network engineers, Wintel engineers and technical help-desk support engineers.

The company also announced the launch of their IT Skills Development Program that will be providing IT students with 500 paid internships over the next two years. An additional 100 scholarships will also be given to underprivileged students to complete their degrees. (ANI)

Walmart lays off 56 employees in India; denies 2nd round of downsizing in Apr,"New Delhi, Jan 13 (PTI) Walmart India on Monday said it is letting go 56 of its employees, including eight from senior management level, as part of restructuring exercise.

The company, which operates 28 cash-and-carry stores in the country, said it is looking at ways to operate more efficiently.

""We are also looking for ways to operate more efficiently, which requires us to review our corporate structure to ensure that we are organized in the right way. As part of this review, we have let go 56 of our associates across levels at the corporate office,"" Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said in a statement.

All of the 56 impacted associates, eight in the senior management and 48 in the middle as well as lower management, have been offered enhanced severance benefits and out placement services to support their transition, he added.

Iyer, however, ruled out a second round of layoffs in April, terming the speculation as baseless and incorrect.

He said the company remains committed to growing its B2B cash and carry business in India.

Walmart opened six new best price modern wholesale stores, one fulfilment centre and the company''s sales grew 22 per cent in 2019, he added.

""We have recently made significant investments to serve our members better and will continue to do so. This includes investments in our brick and mortar stores as well as e-commerce.

""Our members are increasingly becoming omni-channel shoppers. We are thus investing heavily in technology and have a healthy pipeline of best price stores. This will provide our members a true omni-channel and convenient shopping experience in the future,"" Iyer noted.

Layoffs at Walmart''s brick and mortar business began after it bought a majority stake in e-commerce retailer Flipkart in an around USD 16 billion deal in 2018.

Walmart, as per its strategy to strengthen presence in the Indian market and also compete head-on with global rival Amazon, had announced a mega deal to pick up 77 per cent stake in Flipkart.

Walmart had started B2B e-commerce in July 2014 from its Lucknow and Hyderabad ''Best Price Store'' and was later extended to other stores.

It was among one of the first companies in India, which had adopted the omni-channel retail system by integrating online and offline formats here. PTI MSS MR BAL

"Adapt Or Perish! As Old Jobs Shrink, Are You Prepared For Jobs Of Future?","Are you a welder or a sold¬≠ering machine operator in a power plant? Chances are, you‚Äôre not. A medical trans¬≠criptionist? Data entry operator? Machi¬≠nist? A teller at a bank? Perhaps, or some¬≠one you know is. Or was‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs common to all of them? They all sound slightly, er, 20th century, don‚Äôt they? This is a small sample-set of a certain kind of job not as universally to be found as before. Many of them did indeed require skills, patience and unceasing hard work, but some¬≠where, tragically but unrelentingly, they have been‚Äîor are in the process of being‚Äîoutstripped by the pace of technological obsolescence. Yes, there are still thousands of welders and machinists, perhaps more than before: it‚Äôs the ratio that‚Äôs changing. It‚Äôs the shrinking proportion of such jobs, in relation to the total, that tells us of a sea-change. And yes, job security. Once you could spend decades in a job, even in the private sector. Now, when even government is downsizing, you could be looking at five years max, if you‚Äôre lucky.

Say you‚Äôre 19, just a year or so short of entering the job market. You‚Äôd be too young to remember a time when learning typing and shorthand was a sureshot way to land a job. Would you do that now? Not such a smart idea, right? So what do you do? First off, you must understand what‚Äôs happening.

We live in a disquieting era. We have the highest recorded unemployment in decades, but it‚Äôs not just about the sheer numbers. Built into that, and feeding those numbers, is a process. It‚Äôs also a qualitative thing: we have a fast-changing job landscape, and not enough of the new skills to grab what vacancies there are. This implies that we could well be without a job when the economy revs up. Yes, they want software developers, systems analysts, business operations specialists and such like. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily or exclusively mean only high-tech skill sets will be called for. Certain sectors will inevitably expand along with a growing population, and old-school human skills will never go out of fashion. Think of the medical sector, for example: we‚Äôll need more nurses, child/geriatric care-givers, physio¬≠therapists. Customer service represen¬≠tatives are here for good too, but they‚Äôll have to become software-oriented. Good-old engineers are in that flux too. The virtuous cycle will be complete when technology comes to the aid of maids and cleaners. The trick is in attuning to the way society and economy are panning out. And in expanding your repertoire of skills that way. What used to be a 30-year assured work cycle or career 50 years ago, shrunk to a 10-year one around a decade back, and now one needs a thorough upgradation every five years to stay relevant.

Terra Infirma Jobs in mining will also radically change in nature.

The trick is in attuning to the way society and economy are panning out. And in expanding your reportoire of skills that way.

Rajeev Kumar (name changed), a 30-year-old from Faridabad, is depre¬≠ssed these days. Four years into working after a BTech in textiles from Punjab, the going was good: he was an assistant merchandiser in a leading garment export house. But the last six months were a nightmare. ‚ÄúI got an offer from another company, and I switched as they were offering an increment of Rs 5,000 per month.‚Äù Too good to be true, of course. Inside of two months, he was told business was down and he should look for a new job. ‚ÄúI joined another company, where too I was handed a pink slip within three months,‚Äù he says. Nothing wrong with how he worked. It‚Äôs just been the worst time for India‚Äôs garment and textile industry, with robust competition from other South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia leading to a drastic fall in orders‚Ä¶and massive job losses.

Where does that leave those like Rajeev? Well, he has to chart the inevitable path of skill upgradation. The family situation had kept him from doing a PG, but now he‚Äôs looking to do one in business management or further specialisation‚Äîperhaps a stint at a foreign university for an MTech in non-woven and nano-materials textiles. That‚Äôs where the future lies.

In the first 12 years of this century, India went through a paradoxical period of jobless growth. Things worsened in the past seven years, with armies of sullen and traumatised job-seekers on a march to nowhere. Their ranks swelled as new columns of the freshly retrenched joined them. Right now, there are more and more people looking for jobs that number lesser and lesser. Most of us haven‚Äôt realised that the job market has changed, not just in India, but globally. The stories are legion. Zomato recently fired 540 people, 10 per cent of its staff. You may have heard the numbers. But did you know why? They were all customer support people, and a chatbot-based app came along that could handle customer queries. The firm wanted chatbot managers now. Technology simply erased the old jobs, and created a demand for new ones. Roshini Malik, 27, lost her job after three years as a data-entry operator in an accountancy firm. Reason: her skills were outdated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd promised myself I would upgrade my skills. I failed because I thought on-job training would be enough.‚Äù Most of us think that, but it was true only of that largely static world of the past. With the planet spinning faster and faster on its axis, you need way more skills, and must regularly add to them, just to stay where you are. Does that leave you in fear and despair? It need not. There are places, both online and physical, where you can study how to enter the future (see graphic).

The digital waves will wash away old sand sculptures, but create new shapes too. Take retail, for instance. With e-commerce swamping the space, cuts in employment are going to be inevitable. But there will be newer roles‚Äîthey will need professionals literate in digital technology and data sciences: retail data analytics, supply chain analytics, digital marketing, customer experience, fraud analytics professional. You get the drift.

Meanwhile, old jobs shrink. The whole world is feeling the pain, and that‚Äôs expressing itself as economic nationalism (think America First, Brexit). So India will ache on account of that too. The first trend, according to an EY report, will be a slowdown of offshore IT work in India, even as overseas jobs for Indians dry up too. A certain ‚Äúsophistication in demand‚Äù will creep up. If the youth stick to traditional skills, and don‚Äôt acquire higher ones, they will be irreparably squeezed by the ‚Äúhourglass effect‚Äù.

The Hourglass Cometh

As old jobs shrink, the world feels the pain. But the digital waves washing away old sand ¬≠sculptures will create new shapes too.

In the near future, as has happened in the West, the job hierarchy will not look like a pyramid, but a skewed hourglass. The so-called middle jobs that require average skills will constrict; the bulk will slip down to a wide bottom, only a minority will upgrade to that slender top. Say there are hundred employees in the world. The top 20 per cent will earn 80 per cent of the annual incomes. The remaining 20 per cent booty will be split between the dozen or more clinging on to the middle and the vast underclass numbering 60-70. For example, in the world of digital apps, the top floor will be taken up by app designers, and a large number of those who will take instructions from the apps, like cabbies and delivery boys, will crowd the base. ‚ÄúPeople will be expected to be smarter, and be able to work with machines. The need for new skills and change around existing skills has accelerated,‚Äù explains Irwin Anand, MD, India, Udemy, a global online learning platform.

Experts say almost half of present jobs‚Äî47 per cent to be precise‚Äîhave a 70 per cent likelihood of being displaced in a decade. The future will create radically new jobs. According to the EY study, by 2022, as much as 9 per cent of India‚Äôs job market will be constituted by work that doesn‚Äôt exist now, and another 34 per cent by jobs that call for radically changed skills. The trend will be sharper, covering 50-60 per cent of jobs, in sectors such as IT and auto. Almost up to a quarter of existing work will be under threat‚Äînaturally, the highest in IT (20-35%) and financial services (20-25%). A Udemy-Deloitte research found that the half-life of skills in traditional sectors is five years, and a much lower 12-18 months in engineering and technology.

Globally, 21 per cent of existing positions will become redundant, and 27 per cent will comprise entirely new work by 2022, according to the World Economic Forum. The nature of the workplace too will change because of new business models. The gig economy will create new, if highly mobile white-collar jobs. The ‚ÄòUber model‚Äô will take over sectors such as healthcare, maintenance and home services. There will be few jobs that don‚Äôt require any digital skills. A McKinsey study shows that, globally, the demand for digitally literate personnel will grow 55 per cent by 2030, and represent 17 per cent of total manhours, up from 11 per cent in 2016. In India, that spike may be much sharper because it‚Äôs at an earlier phase of technology adoption. Again, this doesn‚Äôt call for mere garden-variety IT literacy, but a highly adaptable, constantly evolving brain‚Äîeven within technology sectors. No course will grant you such a brain. Think of the future employee as a self-learning machine.

The so-called middle jobs that require average skills will constrict; the bulk will slip down to a wide bottom.

‚ÄúThe five sectors with the greatest potential are transport and logistics, retail, food processing, construction, tourism, and hospitality. But employers will seek people with digital acumen, and ability to comprehend data,‚Äù says Ashok Varma, Leader (Social Sector), PwC India. A Brookings Institution study shows that, already between 2002 and 2016, the share of jobs with low digital skill requirements fell from 56 per cent to 30 per cent in the US, while the other side zoomed from 5 per cent to 23 per cent. Expect that to curve further.

A mere engineering degree, once a sureshot passport to attractive designations and lucrative salaries, won‚Äôt suffice. A LinkedIn global survey found engineering and technician roles have diminished in the infrastructure and energy sectors. In IT, system administrators began to give way to those who could do experience design and marketing. Adapt and augment, or perish. Indian students seem to have realised this to an extent, by the way. The official AISHE report says admission to professional courses was at a four-year low in 2018-19. In the past five years, enrolments in BTech and MTech fell by 50 per cent! However, the craze for MBA remains: admissions went up by almost 13 per cent during the same period.

Digital Anganwadi

Sectors hitherto considered low-tech ones have witnessed a transformation too. Digital skills are paramount now in state-sponsored infrastructure and welfare schemes. Anganwadi women workers and ASHAs now have to use mobile apps and digital tools in the Swachh Bharat Mission and POSHAN Abhiyaan: recording data. State officials have to handle that data to monitor these projects. E-governance is filtering down. At the same time, the need for human skills and empathetic engagement will increase too in a variety of social sectors, says McKinsey.

Adapt or perish. Even in state-sponsored ¬≠infrastructure and welfare schemes, ¬≠digital skills have become paramount.

The services sector will emerge as the ‚Äúlargest generator of employment‚Äù in the country, says Kamlesh Vyas, partner, Deloitte India. And here, as elsewhere, ‚Äúself-employment will account for over 50 per cent of (future) jobs,‚Äù he adds. Clearly, entrepre¬≠neurship and start-ups will play a critical role. This, of course, redefines the traditional idea of a ‚Äòjob‚Äô in challenging ways. And the challenge is not just to innovate, but to take these innovations to the market, says Sarit K. Das, director, IIT (Ropar). He sees the ‚Äúbusiness angle‚Äù‚Äîthe ability to fructify ideas in a viable way and monetise them‚Äîas the missing link. Social, emotional and leadership skills are key if a young, imaginative person seeks out schemes like Start-Up India, MUDRA and others.

Higher cognitive skills‚Äîadvanced literacy, quantitative and statistical, critical thinking, information processing, interpretation‚Äîis where the game will be. Jobs that require basic cognitive skills‚Äîdata entry, data processing, cashiers, consumer service‚Äîare what‚Äôs declining. Maybe there will be a time differential between how it unfolds in the West and here, but if you‚Äôre smart, don‚Äôt focus only on competences that will take you to the base of the hourglass. Two reasons. First, it‚Äôs a crowded place with intense competition. That, in turn, will depress wages. The trick is to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.

Companies need to look at reskilling not as additional cost points, but as the nucleus for future growth.

That‚Äôs why online training has become a new hub for the skill development wheel. Millions of young Indians are gravitating to short-term online courses, such as on the AUS-based platform, Coursera. Of its 43 million learners globally, India has emerged as the second-largest market, after the US. In 2018, it added over a million new learners, an average of 95,000 a month. Over 64 per cent of them are in it for computer/data sciences and business. ‚ÄúMost of them hail from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi-NCR, Tamil Nadu and UP,‚Äù says Raghav Gupta, MD (India and APAC), Coursera. And, while nearly three quarters of them are in the 18-29 age bracket, those between 30-39 account for 20 per cent too. A new, vital break in that old, static paradigm where people are usually able to acquire only 20 per cent of the skills they need, as Sumit Kumar, founder of HR solution provider HeadsUp, points out.

It‚Äôs not just people who need to be creative, of course. An enabling atmosphere for job creation calls for sustainable double-digit GDP growth. EY speaks of a ‚Äúdecoupling effect‚Äù that has delinked growth from new incremental jobs. Couple that with a halving of ‚Äúemployment elasticity‚Äù‚Äîthat is, earlier a 10 per cent GDP growth ensured a 4 per cent growth in new jobs; now it‚Äôs 2 per cent. Industry and government have to put their heads together. Companies must look at reskilling not as additional cost points, but as the nucleus for future growth. The government has to extend its present initiatives‚Äîthe ITIs, poly¬≠technics and other skill develop¬≠ment institutes‚Äîin the light of the future transformation. It must not only impart skills for existing jobs, but to prime the youth for future jobs. No point spending huge efforts and money to teach a skill that will become redundant in a few years. And maybe, if enough people upgrade themselves creatively, that hourglass itself can be shattered.

Scared Of IT? What You Can Do

It is a myth that to become a data scientist you need a PhD. A professional ¬≠certificate is suitable for anyone with some computer skills and a passion for self-learning. No prior computer science or programming knowledge is necessary.

Even those who have studied up to just Class XII can do the Google IT Support Gateway certificate. All it costs is Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000. This five-course certificate, developed by Google, prepares a person for an ¬≠entry-level role in IT support. A job in IT can mean in-person or remote help desk work in a small business or at a global company like Google. The course is recognised by several ¬≠national and global IT firms. It equips you to dev¬≠e¬≠lop your skills further in this direction.

Another pretty useful course is What is Data Science? by IBM, which costs Rs 2,700 per month. This ¬≠program comprises nine courses that provide you with the latest job-ready skills and techniques covering a wide array of data science topics, including open source tools and libraries, ¬≠methodologies, Python, databases, SQL, data visualisation, data analysis and machine learning. You will be practising hands-on in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and ¬≠real-world data sets.

Besides, anyone can opt for short-term online courses on AUS-based platform, Coursera. Of the 43 million learners globally, over 64 per cent study computer and data sciences. India is Coursera‚Äôs second-largest market, after the US.

Just 19 pc employers in India bullish on hiring in Oct-Dec qtr: Survey,"New Delhi, Sep 10 (PTI) Only 19 per cent of employers in the country have bullish hiring plans for the next three months, while 52 per cent expect no change in their payrolls, says a global survey which predict softer employment outlook in many markets for the October-December quarter.

According to the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook survey released on Tuesday, that covered 5,131 employers across India, a net 19 per cent of employers are anticipating an actual rise in their staffing numbers, while 52 per cent expect no change and 28 per cent are not sure about adding to their existing staff strength.

Despite the modest number, India is the fourth most optimistic nation about hiring plans for the next three months globally.

The strongest hiring sentiment was reported in Japan where 26 per cent of employers were bullish about their hiring plans for the October-December quarter, followed by Taiwan (21 per cent) and US (20 per cent) in the second and third positions, respectively.

""Hiring plans for the next three months vary significantly globally with robust outlooks reported in many large markets while the uncertainty of Brexit and the impact of tariffs contribute to evidence of softer hiring intentions elsewhere,"" said Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chairman and CEO.

Globally, ManpowerGroup interviewed over 59,000 employers in 44 countries and territories. The survey noted that employers expect workforce gains in 43 of 44 countries and territories surveyed in the coming three months.

When compared with the previous quarter, employers in 15 out of 44 countries and territories report stronger hiring prospects, while employers in 23 countries report weaker hiring plans which also includes six who anticipate ""no change"".

The weakest hiring activity was reported in Spain (0 per cent), the Czech Republic (2 per cent), Argentina (3 per cent), Costa Rica (3 per cent), and Switzerland (3 per cent).

Chinese employers reported a cautious hiring climate in the coming quarter, as a net four per cent employers anticipate a rise in their staff numbers -- their weakest outlook in two years.

""Having a workforce strategy that attracts and retains critical talent and develops new skills will be a key priority across all organisations as industries continue to transform in the months and years ahead,"" Prising said.

The survey further noted that in India, a sectoral analysis shows, public administration and education employers reported the strongest hiring intentions with a net employment outlook of 27 per cent. While, respectable payroll gains were also forecast in wholesale and retail trade sector (25 per cent) and services sector (22 per cent).

Positive hiring opportunities are expected in manufacturing sector and the mining and construction sector, where outlooks stood at 16 per cent and 13 per cent, and in the transportation and utilities sector at 11 per cent.

Employers in all four regions expect to add to payrolls during the forthcoming quarter. The strongest labour market is expected in the east, where net employment outlook stood at 38 per cent.

Steady workforce gains were also forecast in all the other three regions, south, west and north with outlooks of 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.

The ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey is conducted quarterly to measure employers‚Äô intentions to increase or decrease the number of employees in their workforces during the next quarter. PTI DRR ANS ANS

Sodexo Multi-Benefit Pass In India Is Making Employees‚Äô Lives Easier,"Do the innumerable number of cards in your wallet cause you a nightmare? Employee benefit firm Sodexo has launched Multi-Benefit Pass, in order to enhance the employee experience. This is a solution that does not confine its usage to getting meal benefits but also for fuel or other purchases.

Amruta Dhaktode, 30, a software professional in Pune, is quite elated about the launch of multi-benefit pass and said, ‚ÄúI have always found the concept of e-wallet highly intriguing. As Sodexo helped me in ordering in my office premises, this step is going to benefit me for sure but will impact environment too. As this departure from paper coupons will give more impetus to environment friendly digital shopping. How will it help?

The Sodexo multi-benefit pass is a unique solution where a magnetic strip can be used to avail meal benefits across their 100,000+ strong merchant network and can be used across Rupay‚Äôs network of 36 lakh + outlets pan India. It brings many employee benefits like fuel, gift, meal, uniform and books on one card. The company said this is the first such two-in-one card in India and is going to make life of users far more comfortable by ridding of the daily problems.

Rohit Tripathi, 32, a software professional, said, ‚ÄúThis is a great Go-Green Initiative by Sodexo. With single card we can pay for both meal and non-meal expenses. In addition mobile app gives full control on the vouchers and gives me complete statement of purchases and balance. And now I am excited to use 2-in-1 card for multiple purpose.‚Äù

How does it eliminate hassles?

Sodexo multi-benefit Pass eliminates the hassles of managing paper-based claims, eventually increasing work efficiency and is a 100% tax compliant solution. The fully digital nature of the solution is tailor- made according to employee and company needs. In fact it comes with a mobile app where employees don‚Äôt need to carry their card and can use the mobile app to view transaction history. Also this app helps in locating nearest food outlet, lucrative deals and discounts.

Other Benefits

Apart from all other benefits, it will be beneficial in many other ways. If companies want to offer digital gifting options to employee, the virtual wallet can be recharged for the particular amount during festivals like Diwali or Christmas.

So, this decision is coming at a time when digitisation is on an upward spiral and also the government is actively taking this forward.

"Layoffs still commonplace in India, IT sector worst-hit:Report","Mumbai, Apr 13 (PTI) Even as the economy grows, job layoffs continue to remain a ""commonplace"" with the automation prone information technology industry employees experiencing more pain than the others, a report said today.

The report comes amid fears of 'jobless growth' being witnessed in the country at present.

""Even as the economy improves, layoffs - due to cost cutting, reducing redundancies after a merger or acquisition, and restructuring events due to changes in the industry - remain commonplace,"" career transition company Risesmart said in a report after interviewing 1,000 executives.

""The survey concluded that employees in the IT sector experienced more layoffs in comparison to employees in other industries,"" a statement issued here said.

It, however, did not elaborate by quantifying the responses across sectors.

In May last year, the then Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya had confirmed fears of the 'jobless growth' by stating that the economic growth was not translating into rise in employment opportunities.

""The current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it... Growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,"" he had said.

The government and the ruling party had later explained that jobs created in sectors such as tourism and aviation were not counted for the purpose.

In the statement, Risesmart said India has been one of the biggest employment creators globally but hiring has ""plummeted"" recently and the spectre of job layoffs is hitting both big and small companies.

"China Gives Employment To 50k Youth In 24 Hour Whereas, #Modi Gives Employment To 450 People In 24 Hours: Rahul Gandhi","Despite Launching Schemes Like Make In India, Modi Has Created Just 450 Jobs: Rahul Gandhi

The big problem facing India now is creating jobs for the youth, said Congress party President Rahul Gandhi. ""When China is creating 50,000 jobs every 24 hours, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite launching 'Make in India', Start up India' and 'Digital India', has only created 450 to 500 jobs in the country, "" Gandhi told a public rally in Raichur town, as part of his three-day North Karnataka tour.

Gandhi was addressing a rally here, as part of the campaign for Karnataka Assembly election.

The Congress chief has frequently took on the Prime Minister over the state of employment in the country.

India Likely to Weather Recession Better Than Most: ILO,"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) believes India is likely to weather the latest global slowdown better than most countries, provided it ensures rising income levels for the working class and enough jobs for a growing working-age population.According to the annual report on global employment by the ILO, ""The main challenge is not unemployment, but rather the high degree of informality that persists despite strong growth.""""The robust growth witnessed in the South Asian region was driven largely by India and was largely due to the rapid rise in labour productivity, rather than an expansion in employment,"" the report, titled, 'Global Employment Trends 2012: Preventing a Deeper Jobs Crisis', said.This situation is prominent in India, which accounts for 74 per cent of the South Asia region's labour force.In India, total employment grew by only 0.1 per cent over the five years to 2009-10 -- from 457.9 million in 2004-05 to 458.4 million in 2009/10 -- while labour productivity grew by more than 34 per cent over this period.Labour productivity is the amount of goods and services that a worker produces in a given amount of time.A major reason for the slow growth in employment in recent years is the fall in female participation in the labour force. This has been most pronounced in India, where participation of women in labour activities fell from 49.4 per cent in 2004-05 to 37.8 per cent in 2009-10 for rural females and from 24.4 per cent to 19.4 per cent for urban females.This drop in participation can only partly be explained by the strong increase in enrollment in education, because it has been evident across all age groups, the report added.The main labour market challenges in South Asia, including India, are two-fold and consist of achieving the twin goals of increasing labour productivity, to ensure incomes are rising and poverty is falling, and creation of enough jobs for a growing working-age population, which is expanding by around 2 per cent each year, the ILO said.With almost 60 per cent of the population in South Asia under the age of 30, governments should take advantage of this demographic dividend, the report said.The global uncertainty stemming from the euro area sovereign debt crisis and continuing weakness of the United States' economy has negative implications for all countries, including those in the South Asia region.""Overall, the worsening economic conditions will make it more challenging for the South Asia region to promote the creation of productive jobs in the non-farm sector and continue the battle against the persistence of informality, vulnerable employment and specific barriers for women and youth in the labour market,"" the report said.",https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/india-likely-to-weather-recession-better-than-most-ilo/748837,
"Unemployment, Agrarian Distress Will Be Key Issues In Congress Campaign: Sam Pitroda","Unemployment, Agrarian Distress Will Be Key Issues In Congress Campaign: Sam Pitroda

Employment, employment, and employment -- will be the focus of the Congress' election campaign, party's manifesto committee member Sam Pitroda has said, asserting that the country was going through a jobs ""crisis"".

Pitroda, a long-time Gandhi family adviser and the chief of the Indian Overseas Congress, said ‚Äúagrarian distress‚Äù is also a major issue facing the country and it needs to be addressed.

In an interview to PTI, he said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will make a ‚Äúhuge impact‚Äù in the general elections.

Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia took charge as AICC general secretary UP East and UP west respectively last month.

Asked what would be the key issues the Congress will focus on during the campaign that will strike a chord with the people, Pitroda said: ‚ÄúEmployment, employment, employment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe country is going through a big employment crisis. We have not created new employment. We have in fact eaten into the employment base we already had. So, today the real challenge is how do we create new jobs,‚Äù he said.

Pitroda said employment has been affected by factors such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

‚ÄúIf you don't focus on employment there will be a major crisis,‚Äù the technocrat-turned-politician warned.

On whether the Congress has been able to take up the issue of employment in its campaign and narrative, Pitroda said: ‚ÄúYou will see it in the manifesto.‚Äù

He expressed confidence that Congress will finish the process of stitching up alliances in various states and its tie-ups will become clear soon.

Asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi was matching up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of being the prime challenger, Pitroda said he doesn‚Äôt see the contest as a challenge between two individuals.

‚ÄúI think it is a challenge between the idea of India. It is about what kind of a nation you want to build going forward, what are the real challenges you have on employment, inclusion and all that,‚Äù he said

Pitroda also said it was a fight of ideologies and a fight between politics of hate and politics of love.

He asserted that ‚Äúagrarian distress‚Äù is also a major issue.

‚ÄúI was told that there is problem of excess supply of onions and potatoes, and the prices are way down and that hurts farmers,‚Äù he said.

Pitroda, who is credited with being the architect of the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi, also alleged that science and technology had been on the ‚Äòback burner in a big way‚Äù under the Modi government.

Asked how the Congress will bring the narrative back to real issues such as employment and alleged agrarian distress post the Balakot air strikes, he said the party will raise key issues on the ground among people.

Pitroda is part of the 19-member Manifesto Committee set up by the Congress to come out with the party's manifesto for the general elections.

Pitroda has worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded the National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.

"Govt Revives 'Compulsory Retirement' Plan For Central Employees, Unions Protest","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Narendra Modi government's decision to cut deadwood from bureaucracy has invited sharp criticism from employees' unions and former civil servants. The government has recently revived a premature retirement plans for central government employees who have completed 30 years in service or reach 50 years of age after reviewing their performance on a regular basis.

An order issued by Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 20 notifies that all central government establishments must send detailed monthly reports of how many central government employees were reviewed and how many were recommended for premature retirement. Those who are disqualified will be given three-month notice to retire from service.

However, this is not the first time the Modi government is introducing such a measure. In 2014, too, the government moved an order to give premature retirement to central government officials.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a former civil servant said the Centre's move was an attempt to privatize government sector.

He also pointed out that since the government has revived the 2014 order after slight modification, it shows its commitment to implement it.

In a bid to rid the bureaucracy of ‚Äúunproductive officers‚Äù, the Centre has now decided to review the performance of bureaucrats on a regular basis.

But this time, the order has been modified and issued to all ministries and departments‚Äîincluding the Prime Minister's Office, President's Secretariat and Cabinet Secretariat.

The order comes at a time when there is a widespread concern in the bureaucratic circle over Modi government‚Äôs forced retirement of top 27 tax officials on the grounds of corruption and misconduct. An official, familiar with the development, says the government‚Äôs decision to induct 400 private sector specialists at middle-level through lateral entry is indicative of a shake-up in the public administration service.

The DoPT order also says, ""The Ministries should ensure that the prescribed procedure like forming of opinion to retire a government employee prematurely in public interest is strictly adhered to, and that the decision is not an arbitrary one, and is not based on collateral grounds as per the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of lJOt & Col. J.N.Sinha [1571 SCR (1) 791]‚Äù.

The latest DoPT order states that the review process must be in accordance with the orders in 2014, 2015, and 2017. Detailed guidelines for performance review have been given in the previous order, citing various Supreme Court observations. The new order applies to employees in the A, B, and C groups, whereas the first order applies only to A and B group level officers.

D Manoharan, General Secretary of Southern Railway Employees Union, points out that three lakh railways employees will be affected if the government implements the order. ‚ÄúThe government has issued the order for the second time. They are serious about implementing it. In our view, the government wants to reduce the workforce of the central government slowly and wants to privatize the central government sectors,‚Äù said Manoharan.

He added that employees union will intensify their agitation if the government begins the process of sacking employees.",https://www.outlookindia.com/website/story/india-news-centres-move-to-cut-deadwood-from-bureaucracy-an-attempt-to-privatise-govt-sector-employees-unions/333495,
"Govt to conduct new survey on employment, says Debroy","Govt to conduct new survey on employment, says Debroy

New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) The government will conduct a new national sample survey on employment, which will show that there has been ""substantial job creation"", prime minister's economic advisory council chief Bibek Debroy said Friday.

Amid a raging controversy over employment data, Debroy also said states are largely responsible for creating ""business environment"" and jobs.

On Thursday, a media report based on the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO) periodic labour force survey, said unemployment rate had hit a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. However, the same day, the government said it had not finalised the survey on labour force.

""We will have a new round of the NSS which will soon be announced and I am sure that that particular survey will show that there has been substantial employment and substantial job creation,"" Debroy, who is the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) chairman, said.

In a video message posted on the Facebook page of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Debroy also said a large part of what happens to ""jobs, employment, the business environment is in the province of the states"".

The EAC-PM chairman also pointed out that India does not have any robust statistical data on job creation after the year 2011-12.

Stating that India's labour force is still informal and unorganised, he said: ""The enterprise surveys provide a very imperfect understanding of what is happening to employment in India.""

Debroy said the real issue is not the number of jobs created but the quality of jobs and wage rates.

Noting that the government per se can only provide a limited number of jobs, Debroy also said the bulk of jobs would have to be created outside the government.

""And this is precisely what the Modi government has been doing by pushing self-employment, by pushing entrepreneurship.

""This is what the prime minister means when he talks about StandUp India, StartUp India,"" the EAC-PM chief said.

On January 28, acting chairman and another member of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) resigned, saying the government had not released the job numbers despite the commission's approval.

The NSSO job report was previously planned to be released in December 2018. PTI BKS CS HRS

"No, India didn‚Äôt suddenly rediscover SAARC. The latest outreach is in line with old policy","On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hosted a video conference with leaders of the countries comprising the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation for sharing strategies as well as exploring possibilities of a regional response to the coronavirus threat. India proposed a slew of measures, including the setting up of a Covid-19 emergency fund with an initial contribution of $10 million from it, putting together a rapid response team of doctors and specialists, and setting up an information system for disease surveillance.

As an initiative from the pivotal power in South Asia, India‚Äôs outreach showed the specific use of regional groupings such as SAARC. It was the first summit-level SAARC meeting since 2014. The proposed summit in 2016 in Islamabad had been called off after India decided to stay away in the wake of the Uri terror attack, and Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Bhutan followed suit. This latest use of the SAARC platform shows how India can employ the horses-for-courses principle in its regional diplomacy, and not get tied to one such group in the region.

However, in their initial reactions to India‚Äôs initiative, a few commentators and observers of the country‚Äôs foreign policy took potshots at its sudden rediscovery of SAARC. Such reactions show a lack of understanding of how SAARC has figured in India‚Äôs diplomatic recalibrations in South Asia since its inception in 1985. There isn‚Äôt anything surprising about India‚Äôs careful, even intermittent, use of SAARC, especially in light of New Delhi using other multilateral groups to pursue its interests in South Asia. In this context, two aspects of India‚Äôs spells of engagement as well as relative disinterest with SAARC need to be considered.

First, the realist school of India‚Äôs strategic thinking, and by extension, its foreign policy, has for decades viewed SAARC with circumspection. One may recall that writing at the onset of this century, foreign policy scholar professor Stephen Cohen had observed that India was ‚Äúwary of SAARC‚Äù and instead preferred to deal with its South Asian neighbours on a bilateral basis. In his 2001 book India: Emerging Power, Cohen observes that the realist section of India‚Äôs strategic thinking has always been apprehensive of SAARC‚Äôs scope because the group doesn‚Äôt work in even one of the two conditions that India considers key to regional cooperation in South Asia.

The first of these conditions is the presence of a dominant and benevolent power that wields enough clout to regulate regional behaviour. Clearly, SAARC doesn‚Äôt have such an overarching power for regulating the international behaviour of regional actors. Second, the efficacy of such groups is dependent on the presence of a semblance of equally capable regional states. With huge power-asymmetry among its member states, SAARC doesn‚Äôt satisfy this condition either. Although some strategic thinkers argue that for limited purposes this asymmetry may work to India‚Äôs advantage, like in regional economic integration, the mismatch restricts the scope of a regional forum. On the other hand, anxieties about domination by India have thwarted even the limited potential for regional cooperation.

India, remember, was a reluctant entrant to SAARC when it was set up at Bangladesh‚Äôs initiative. A lukewarm approach also marked how India participated in the forum. It suspected the forum was ‚Äúa ganging up of mostly hostile smaller neighbours as a containment strategy against it‚Äù, Shyam Saran, former foreign secretary of India, writes in his 2017 book How India Sees the World. ‚ÄúThe motivations of some of the neighbours did justify this suspicion.‚Äù

Saran goes on to cite the attempts made by smaller members such as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal to use SAARC as a mediating forum for bilateral issues, including Kashmir, and river water disputes between India and Nepal or India and Bangladesh. Interestingly, to a large extent, the latter water dispute was resolved bilaterally in the last decade, and not because of the mediation of any regional forum.

There was also the example of how Nepal tried to obstruct the entry of Afghanistan as the eighth member of SAARC in 2005. The move was seen by Indian diplomats as the erstwhile Nepali monarchy‚Äôs way of hitting back at it for opposing the then King Gyanendra‚Äôs assumption of absolute powers and the suspension of arms supplies to his army. The Nepal delegation‚Äôs demand for the inclusion of China in SAARC couldn‚Äôt be met but it was eventually placated by extending ‚Äúobserver status‚Äù to China, the US and Japan.

India‚Äôs post-economic liberalization momentum made the case for using SAARC for economic integration of the region (on the pattern of ASEAN) or for free trade pacts strong on paper, but its implementation hit roadblocks. The most significant hindrance was Pakistan, which has been strategically averse to any form of regional economic integration with India at the pivot. In the last few years, however, New Delhi has sought some creative ways to circumvent such hindrance by recalling something that is very much a part of the SAARC charter.

A glimpse of how India sought to leverage SAARC for a new kind of economic regionalism was apparent at the Kathmandu summit in 2014. Modi hinted at the need for a two-speed SAARC. This is how foreign policy commentator C Raja described India‚Äôs move:

‚ÄúRather than let one country take the entire region hostage, Modi suggested, those who are ready for integration should move ahead. As a result, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal got together soon after the Kathmandu summit to implement the motor vehicle agreement.The BBIN framework was seen by many as heralding the era of ‚ÄòSAARC Minus One‚Äô and hostile to Pakistan. The BBIN, however, was very much part of the SAARC framework. The SAARC charter allows two or more countries of the forum to embark on what is called ‚Äòsub-regional cooperation‚Äô. It was a policy instrument that was long available to policymakers in Delhi but remained unutilised.‚Äù

That, however, didn‚Äôt mean India was relying on this group for its objectives of economic diplomacy in the region. Far from it. India assigned it a specific role while exploring multilateral alternatives in South Asia for different objectives.

This takes us to the second point that‚Äôs often discounted while discussing India‚Äôs approach to SAARC. In recent years, India has recalibrated its South Asian regional initiative towards other forums, particularly the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, or BIMSTEC. India‚Äôs renewed focus on BIMSTEC, which it was involved in setting up in 1997, shows how the country sees it as an economic cooperation forum as well as a strategic move.

A grouping of five South Asian countries, excluding Pakistan, and two South East Asian countries has certain strategic advantages for India that the foreign policy establishment in New Delhi can‚Äôt afford to ignore.

While the prime minister invited leaders of the SAARC members to his swearing-in ceremony in 2014, he chose to welcome BIMSTEC leaders after his re-election in 2019. On the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Goa in 2016, Modi also hosted BIMSTEC leaders. The next year, while speaking at the grouping‚Äôs summit, the prime minister described it as ‚Äúa natural platform to fulfill our key foreign policy priorities of Neighborhood First and Act East‚Äù.

The growing significance of BIMSTEC for India can be seen in the context of how the country is focusing on the Bay of Bengal. This comes in the wake of strategic strides made by China in registering its presence in the Bay of Bengal. While economic logic for it may be traced to how the Bay of Bengal‚Äôs geographical location is important for China‚Äôs international trade, other advantages cannot be ruled out, including the region being a major repository of natural gas.

Indian diplomacy, however, would still hedge its bets in carrying out a comparative analysis of SAARC and BIMSTEC. In all likelihood, it would look to attain specific objectives from these regional groups, hoping that some of them are complementary goals for both the groups. For a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic, India has picked the regional platform that is most relevant to tackling the health emergency. So, far from being a sudden rediscovery of SAARC, India‚Äôs latest initiative shows a continuity in its broader approach.",https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/18/no-india-didnt-suddenly-rediscover-saarc-the-latest-outreach-is-in-line-with-old-policy,
How cybercrime is wrecking the lives of women in India‚Äôs hinterland,"A 21-year-old woman from a village in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Mahoba can relate. She was shocked to hear about a photograph of hers that had gone viral. Posted on Facebook by a young man of her village popularly known as Chaubey, it was a picture of a naked woman with her face. A morphed photo that garnered likes and shares and was soon spread by WhatsApp forwards. The woman, who works with the local National Rural Livelihood Mission, was determined to turn the perpetrator in, despite desperate pleas by her family not to risk her reputation. ‚ÄúWhat about her izzat?‚Äù her father asked. ‚ÄúShe is unmarried.‚Äù

The woman spent two weeks trying to get hold of the image. She finally saw it on the village pradhan‚Äôs phone. ‚ÄúI took him along to the police station since I finally had the evidence,‚Äù she recounted.

She was asked to speak with the constable at the thana. She did and the matter was referred to the official in charge of the police chowki. Then it went cold. This despite the identity of the perpetrator being known. ‚ÄúI see him hanging around,‚Äù the woman said. ‚ÄúHe even approached me and told me smugly that I was wasting my time. All it meant to him were a few payoffs to the tune of Rs 5,000.‚Äù

Awadh Singh, the Circle Officer of Kulpahad city in Mahoba, where the case is pending, said the investigation was underway.

Uttar Pradesh tops Indian states in crimes against women , as per the National Crime Records Bureau. In the past few years, it has also seen a spike in cases of cybercrime . Nearly 6,280 cybercrime cases were reported in 2018, an increase of 26% over the previous year. But with dowry killings and rapes topping the list of crimes against women, the state‚Äôs law enforcement apparatus often does not have the bandwidth or even the inclination to pursue a cybercrime. There‚Äôs also poor awareness as illustrated at the Kulpahad police station, where the Mahoba woman‚Äôs case is lying shut in a dusty file.

Another problem, former police chief of Banda district Shalini Singh pointed out, is that women who fall victim to cybercrime are often hesitant to file complaints. It‚Äôs because there isn‚Äôt wide recognition of cybercrime as violence. Violence is rape, it‚Äôs generally understood, violence is a dowry killing. That a photo you may have posted online can be manipulated with the intention of harming you isn‚Äôt your fault isn‚Äôt made clear to women in small towns. Indeed, even the woman in Mahoba who fought back insisted she had never used a smartphone. As if that could be a crime, too. ‚ÄúI only use the basic phone and that too for work,‚Äù she said.

Still, as Suneeta told the conference, young women are starting to fight back. A 14-year-old from another village in Mahoba is a case in point. She was on her way to a coaching class when three men grabbed her, took her to an isolated place, disrobed her and took photographs of her.

The girl filed a police complaint, identifying the men as Dhabbu, Gabbar and Pinku. One of them had been harassing her for days, she stated in her complaint. ‚ÄúHe was constantly telling me that he loved me. I told him I didn‚Äôt love him and I wasn‚Äôt even interested in friendship. He continued to follow me around.‚Äù

Since the assault, the men have visited her several times and sought to blackmail her. ‚ÄúThey keep threatening me that they will leak the pictures on the net, they will make sure the pictures go viral.‚Äù

Her family has been supportive of her decision to pursue the case, despite being told by local cops, they claim, to ‚Äúsettle the matter‚Äù.

Officially, though, Abhimanyu Yadav from the Kulpahad police station, where the case is registered, said an investigation into the matter is ongoing.

"In India‚Äôs villages, upper castes still use social and economic boycotts to shackle Dalits","Rajat Kalsan, a Dalit activist and lawyer, said the Jats, who are the dominant caste group in Haryana as well, were livid that the Dalits had sidestepped the traditional forum of resolving the issue ‚Äî the village panchayat ‚Äî and dared to take the legal route.

The upper caste villagers, Kalsan said, ‚Äúconsider referring to the Dalits with casteist names as normal and, in fact, their right‚Äù. ‚ÄúThey have still not come to terms with the fact that this could be a crime, legally. They say they have been referring to the Dalits with such names for ages, so how come, all of a sudden, it has become such a big deal?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey wouldn‚Äôt have reacted like this had the complaint been only about the physical assault,‚Äù he added, explaining that it also referred to the use of casteist slurs.

The first meeting to work out a compromise, a few days after the incident, was held at the Ravidas temple, revered by most Dalits. The second meeting was called for about two weeks later by the Jats. This time, the upper castes asked the Dalits to meet at a venue at the centre of the village surrounded by Jat houses.

‚ÄúWe were reluctant to go there as we suspected humiliation and physical assault by the dominant community members,‚Äù said Ajay, a Dalit from Bhatla.

According to the villagers and data from the 2011 census, of the 7,000-odd people in Bhatla, 42 percent are Dalits. They belong to such castes as Sansi, Valmiki, Dhanak and Chamar, with the last being the most numerous. The victims of the assault are Chamars.

When the Chamars did not turn up at the meeting called by the Jats, the village‚Äôs watchman was sent to their locality the next day with a message. ‚ÄúThe watchman arrived at our basti and read out the message that a bundi ‚Äî social and economic boycott ‚Äî of the Dalits had been decided,‚Äù said Ajay. ‚ÄúIt said the villagers had been told not to engage the Dalits in farm work or conduct any kind of economic transaction with them.‚Äù

Initially, the boycott was of all the Dalit castes in the village. Later, the upper castes realised that boycotting all the Dalit would not be feasible as they needed labourers to work in their fields.

‚ÄúChamars were at the forefront of the protest against the upper castes so it was important to single them out,‚Äù said Vikas, a Dalit from Bhatla.

The boycott rendered all the Chamars jobless. Even members of other caste groups were told to not have any economic transactions with them. If they did, they were threatened with fines of Rs 11,000.

‚ÄúThe barber would refuse to cut our hair, the electrician would not visit our houses, the sole dairy of the village, which is owned by a Brahmin, would not sell us milk,‚Äù said Ajay.

And nobody would let the cattle of the Chamars graze in their fields. ‚ÄúThere is no public land available in the village where our cattle could graze,‚Äù Vikas explained. ‚ÄúEarlier, we used to let our cattle graze in fields owned by villagers in exchange for money. However, after the boycott, they would not let us do that. This forced us to sell our cattle at a huge loss.‚Äù

When out-of-work Dalits tried to find employment in neighboring villages, the Jats confronted the neighboring co-caste landowners and tried to persuade them not to hire the Dalits of Bhatla for work.

‚ÄúWhen the Jats of the neighboring villages still insisted on hiring us for their fields, our villagers would deflate the tires of their tractors on which they had come to hire us,‚Äù said Vikas.

The Dalits told Newslaundry the boycott was ongoing, but the Jats rejected the claim. The Dalits also alleged that neither the police nor the local administration had helped them since the officials were divided along caste lines as well.

A second FIR on the social boycott was filed by the Dalits on November 1, 2018.

***

Social and economic boycotts of the marginalised people in India are a relatively new phenomenon, becoming more frequent since the Green Revolution. ‚ÄúGreen Revolution ushered in an era of increased agricultural productivity with intensive agriculture and multiple crops being produced, giving the Dalits an opportunity to demand higher wages,‚Äù said Surinder S Jodhka, a sociology professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi.

In parts of north India, Jodhka said, the Dalits were in demand as labourers but there weren‚Äôt enough of them, so big farmers started hiring labourers from other states, Jodhka said. This rendered the Dalits dispensable for the agriculture economy.

‚ÄúDalits also saw this as empowering as they could now go out of the village and look for different kinds of employment opportunities which, in many cases, they found more lucrative,‚Äù said Jodhka. ‚ÄúGradually, the Dalits started to distance themselves from farming, as that involved patron-client relationships.‚Äù",https://www.newslaundry.com/2020/03/05/in-indias-villages-upper-castes-still-use-social-and-economic-boycotts-to-shackle-dalits,

Kantabai Dhude, 56, of Chandwad tehsil‚Äôs Kundanasheri village in Nashik had reached the premises of Mahamarg bus stand at around 2 pm. She was accompanied by her husband and several other villagers. Dhude is a labourer and earns Rs 150 per day. ‚ÄúI work in the farms of other people, but this work is available only for six months. For the remainder of the period, we don‚Äôt have any work to survive on in our village. In the summer season, there are days when we have to sleep empty stomach. But what to do, we are helpless as we don‚Äôt have any other source of income,‚Äù the 56-year-old told Newslaundry.

Kantabai who is a tribal from Mahadeo Koli community has been fighting to get land under the Forest Rights Act, 2006, for the last 8 years. She said, ‚ÄúWe are tribals and have been living in our area since the last fifty years. Still, we haven‚Äôt been allowed land under the Act. Most of the tribal men and women in our village work as labourers. However, women are paid less than men. Men are paid Rs 200 per day whereas women are paid Rs 150 a day.‚Äù



There are several other problems, she says. ‚ÄúThere is a huge scarcity of water in our area. We bathe once in two days or else we will not have sufficient water to drink. The government has provided us gas but they have stopped distributing kerosene oil. The problem is that we don‚Äôt have electricity in our village and we require kerosene oil to light lamps in our homes. Unavailability of kerosene has become a huge problem, it is very difficult to cook food in the dark.‚Äù

He told Newslaundry, ‚ÄúI have been working as a labourer since I was 10 years old. I have spent my whole life in poverty.

"India's unemployment rate rises to 7.78%, highest in 4 months: CMIE","India's unemployment rate rose to 7.78% in February, the highest since October 2019, and up from 7.16% in January, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Monday, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37% in February from 5.97% in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65% from 9.70%, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/india-unemployment-rate-rises-to-7-78-cmie-1651489-2020-03-02,
"Unemployment in October rises to 8.5%, highest in over 3 years","Unemployment in October has gone up to 8.5 per cent, the highest in over three years. (Photo: Reuters)

India's unemployment rate in the month of October jumped to 8.5 per cent, which is the highest in over three years.

Fresh data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed that the rise in India's unemployment rate in October was the highest since August 2016.

While the government has been announcing a pool of measures to increase demand, the slowdown in jobs is being viewed as the impact of slowdown on the country's economic growth.

To make matters worse, India's infrastructure output for the month of September contracted 5.2 per cent on a year-on-year or YoY basis. It is one of the worst performances by the eight core infrastructure industries.

It is worth noting that as many as seven of eight core industries saw a contraction in output in September.

A new academic research paper released by the Centre of Sustainable Employment also concluded that there has been a significant decline in total employment in India between 2011-12 and 2017-18, reported The Indian Express.

The research paper by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K Parida indicated that total employment during the abovementioned period decline by a whopping nine million, adding that this has happened for the first time in Indian history.

Experts also say that the unemployment wave in India has significantly hurt the unorganised sector, which includes a fair amount of season labour. Daily-wage labourers have also been affected due to demand slowdown.

Witnessing a sharp contraction in demand, several manufacturers cut down on production over the last few months, resulting in higher joblessness among individuals working as daily wage or contractual workers.",https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/unemployment-in-october-rises-to-8-5-highest-in-over-3-years-1614751-2019-11-01,
Why Indian economy is not listening to Modi govt,"It has been the story of anti-climax for past several quarters. Country folks expect new numbers to give some good news signaling ""sab change si"" (all is well) sentiment but the Indian economy fails with as much consistency to live up to their expectations. It was expected the pre-budget mini reform would push the numbers up for key indicators of Indian economy but the wrong indicators shot up even after the Budget reforms were proposed in February.

Unemployment figures have gone up in the latest data, released by the the Mumbai-based private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) -- from 7.16 per cent in January this year to 7.78 per cent in February. It is higher than the October 2019 figures from pre-November intervention announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Villages have borne the brunt of economic slowdown. Consumption has been particularly low in rural areas creating a ripple effect on the overall health of the Indian economy. The slowdown in consumption is directly related to declining earning or less money in pocket to spend.

Decline in income is the result of loss of employment or rise in unemployment. The CMIE data shows that unemployment rate increased in rural areas from 5.97 per cent in January to 7.37 per cent in February. Silver lining could be the decline in unemployment in urban areas from 9.7 per cent to 8.65 per cent, according to the CMIE.

Growing unemployment is a direct fallout of extended economic slowdown. Indian economy is growing at a 7-year-low GDP growth rate. It was 4.7 per cent in October-December 2019. This came on the back of a 5 per cent GDP growth rate clocked in previous quarter.

The road ahead is worrisome with continued slump in manufacturing coupled with coronavirus outbreak that has proven to be stifling global economic growth. Analysts predict further deceleration of Indian economy on account of coronavirus scare.

Following measures announced in November and then in February Budget - including restructuring of corporate income tax - it was expected that the manufacturing sector would respond positively. But its growth slowed down in February, according to monthly survey by Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).

PMI data show that manufacturing sector growth declined from seven-year high of 55.3 in January to 54.5 in February. However, the index is above 50 showing the sector is still expanding.

Meanwhile, Fitch Solutions in its latest estimate cut down its forecast for India's GDP growth for 2019-20 from 5.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent, and from 5.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent for 2020-21. Simply put, Fitch Solutions does not see much scope of recovery from economic slowdown in India.

Weak manufacturing, weaker domestic demand and coronavirus-induced global supply chain breakdown have applied fresh brakes on India's economic vehicle.

The grim sentiment of the market is reflected in credit flow from the banks. It is a key indicator to gauge the undercurrents of a major economy. In India, the bank credit growth declined to 8.5 per cent in January compared to 13.5 per cent during the same month last year.

The sharp decline in credit growth shows either industries are reluctant in applying for loans or the banks don't have enough faith in the ability of the market for repayment. There is another explanation though. That the banks are wary of too much of regulation by the government, the bankers say this in private conversations.

So, the moot question is, why is Indian economy not listening to the Modi government, which has been unleashing reforms after reforms in the manner that it thinks fit?

There is no clear answer even though one can enlist a number of factors from consumption decline to coronavirus effect. There is a clue though in what Hardeep Singh Puri, the commerce and industry minister said at a function in Pune, Maharashtra on Sunday.

""We are already the third largest domestic civil aviation market and handling 435 million passengers per year. We aim to add 100 new airports in the near future. We have 750 civil aircraft manning our skies and adding 2-3 aircraft per week. Is it slowdown?"" he questioned.

One can interpret this as denial of (a problem) economic slowdown by the government or cherry-picking from economic indicators rather than confronting the issue head on. Puri picked up ""more passengers in air"" for instance to defuse economic slowdown theory.

And, he is not the only minister in the Modi cabinet to defend economic slowdown in the last seven quarters.",https://www.indiatoday.in/news-analysis/story/why-indian-economy-is-not-listening-to-modi-govt-1651886-2020-03-03,
"Cat finally out of the bag: Unemployment at 45-year high, government defends data","The worst fears have come true. Unemployment in the country is at a four-decade-high. The figures released by the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI) on Friday pegged joblessness at 6.1 per cent. The report was released after a long delay.

The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) job survey for 2017-18 had shown a spike in the unemployment rate to over 6 per cent, a 45-year high, but the report was not released by the government, which termed it as a draft report.

Releasing the data, officials said that they have used a new design methodology for the survey hence it was not comparable with previous data.

The Finance Ministry also issued a statement which said that comparing the recent jobs data with past data was faulty.

The annual report (July 2017-June 2018) of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) pegs the all India unemployment rate at 6.1 per cent in the given year. Unemployment was higher in the urban areas as compared to the rural. For the rural areas, the unemployment rate was 5.3 per cent, while in the urban areas it was 7.8 per cent.

Among the rural men, the unemployment rate was 5.8 per cent while among the women it was 3.8 per cent. While among the urban men it was 7.8 per cent and 5.7 per cent among urban women. MoSPI officials said that the number of households surveyed was 433339 (246809 in rural areas and 46006 in urban areas).

ALSO READ | PM Modi's acche din claims are great but what about data on jobs, farmers' suicide & crime?

The officials, however, said that this data is comparable to the previous years data.

Recognising India's evolving economy and requirements, it was decided to make a few changes with respect to availability of household data on employment-unemployment.

In the PLFS conducted from 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

The rationale for this decision was based on the act that the education levels in the economy have risen due to this various policy interventions like the Right to Education Act etc, and it would be important to assess the level of employment and unemployment using this as a stratification basis, the officials said.

But the Finance Ministry issued a statement trashing attempts to compare the 2017-18 data with previous years.

""There can be nothing farther away from the truth than saying that unemployment in India is at a 45 year low,"" the statement said.

It further said that past jobs data was measured using expenditure of households as a criteria, the current jobs data uses education as a criteria instead of expenditure.

In India, the labour force surveys (Employment and Unemployment Surveys or EUS) have usually been bundled along with the household Consumer Expenditure Survey, conducted typically once in five years. The employment and unemployment surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey till 2011-12 used the monthly per capita expenditure of the household in the selected villages/blocks as a basis for stratification of households.

In the PLFS conducted from 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

The change in criteria from monthly per capita expenditure to education levels for stratification of availability of household data on employment-unemployment has direct implications on the comparability of the results of PLFS with the EUS of earlier years, the finance ministry said.

In view of this, the PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis, it said.

It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen. Thus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or work force requiring low skills and low remuneration, the minstry argued in its statement.

The Finance Ministry said that there are various facets to the employment and unemployment scenario and no single data source is complete by itself. These data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market.

In this direction, the ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to EPFO, ESIC and NPS to give an assessment of changes in the formal market employment.

The PLFS survey data complemented by administrative data and data from other sources need to be triangulated to get a complete picture.

Reacting to the data, Congress spokesperson RPN Singh said, ""We are satisfied we raised this issue during the elections but now people have made their choice, I hope the government will focus on joblessness in this tenure.""

Notably, this data has been released after a long delay and controversy.

The withholding of the jobs report had made headlines in January this year when three members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) had resigned protesting against the withholding of the NSSO‚Äôs first Annual Survey on Employment and Unemployment for 2017-18.

Money for jobless: 4 MPs offer Modi govt a wayout from unemployment maze,"Four Members of Parliament are ready with Private Member's Bill in the Lok Sabha offering a way out for the Narendra Modi government to deal with high unemployment. The bills propose doling out some form of unemployment allowance to jobless citizens.

Three of these MPs belong to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- Gadchiroli-Chimur MP Ashok Mahadeorao Nete, South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri and Jalgaon MP Unmesh Bhaiyyasaheb Patil. The other is Su Thirunavukkarasar, the Congress MP from Tiruchirappalli.

Nete's Unemployment Allowance Bill 2019 seeks to provide an allowance to all unemployed people. Bidhuri's Financial Assistance to Unemployed Post-Graduates Bill 2019, however, restricts the unemployment allowances to unemployed postgraduates only.

Patil's Unemployed Youth (Allowance and Employment Opportunities) Bill 2019 eyes the twin-purpose of generating gainful employment opportunities and payment of unemployment allowance.

Su Thirunavukkarasar's Unemployment Allowance Bill proposes unemployment allowances for jobless youth until they get gainful employment.

Interestingly, the previous Lok Sabha also saw three similar bills seeking unemployment allowances for unemployed youth. But with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the bills lapsed.

Unable to tame rising unemployment has been the biggest criticism against the Narendra Modi government in its near six-year tenure. Part of the blame does lie with the central government itself. More than 6.83 lakh posts are lying vacant in the central government, Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh told Parliament last week, in a written reply. And, this was the figure as on March 1, 2018 - almost two years ago.

Now, these bills offer a way out, howsoever unlikely it may seem for them to get the nod of Parliament. These bills don't have approval of the government. The last Private Member's Bill that Parliament passed was in 1970.

But there has been a rush among political parties to garner popular support in the name of unemployment allowances. The Congress proposed one such scheme, with intelligible help from Nobel Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee, during the Lok Sabha election 2019.

Rahul Gandhi, then as the Congress president, announced a minimum income guarantee scheme called Nyay (Nyuntam Aay Yojana). The Congress proposed to give Rs 6,000 to bottom 20 per cent families of India on the basis of their average income. An estimated 5 crore families or 25 crore individuals were to be benefited from the scheme.

However, either the scheme came late into election campaign and failed to strike a chord with the electorate or the voters believed the counter-narrative of the BJP and PM Modi more than the proponents of Nyay scheme. The BJP returned with bigger mandate at the Centre.

Nevertheless, nearly all major political parties have included unemployment allowances schemes in their manifestos in state elections. Some notable examples include the BJP in Rajasthan (Rs 5,000); the Congress in just-concluded Delhi Assembly election (Rs 5,000-Rs 7,500); the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, TRS in Telangana, TDP in Andhra Pradesh and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand last year.

In fact, reports from Jharkhand suggest that huge numbers of youth are lining up at the employment exchanges to get themselves registered. They anticipate the Hemant Soren government will fulfill the promise that the JMM made during the Jharkhand election. The JMM promised an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000-Rs 7,500 to unemployed youths.

Extended economic slowdown and reported highest unemployment rate in the country have made unemployment allowances sell like a hot cake in election. A recent research paper of the State Bank of India has painted a worrier picture of employment in 2020. It said the year would see 16 lakh fewer job creation than the previous year.

These reports of high unemployment rate are at variance with the claims made by the central government and PM Modi, who in his speeches has cited figures from Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to assert that the country is creating more jobs than before. He has been seen citing the examples of a ""pakodewallah"" or a street vendor selling tea or vegetables.

The official record shows that unemployment among those above 35 is very low. But critics point out that in the absence of a credible social security scheme, youth who fail to get a job of their choice prefer any kind of self-employment to staying unemployed for eternity. This is disguised unemployment, they say.

The last economic survey (the sixth) -- though it reflects the figures of January 2013-April 2014 (that is, before the Modi government came to power) -- shows that close to 72 per cent of all ""establishments"" (read self-employed youths) have no hired labour. They are in all potential disguised unemployment.

This may also be the reason why grey collar job providers such as Quess Corp and Team Lease -- both Bengaluru-based companies -- are among the top job providers in the private sector. However, these firms yet remain largely ""unknown"". They supply the bulk of delivery boys, support staff in logistic companies, hotels, hospitals, cab and security services, receptions, sales and BPOs, IT workers, construction supervisors, and skilled technicians.

Qess Corp has surpassed the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as the biggest job provider in India -- 3.85 lakh to 3.6 lakh. Overall, the TCS has lead at about 4.5 lakh workers including overseas employment.

This makes Indian job market very fluid as well as vulnerable to shocks. Moves like demonetisation and single-phase rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) had a more adverse impact on the grey-collar economy than what the government might have prepared for.

The four bills seeking unemployment allowances may offer the government a way to deal with the unemployment situation temporarily, if not in longer term. However, the governments -- both the Centre and in states -- have shown little attention to already existing unemployment allowance scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).

This promise of unemployment allowances for unemployed job seekers does not get attention of the government. Reports suggest that NREGS unemployment allowances are rarely paid and many state governments usually don't even keep a record of unemployed job seekers who are legally entitled to get the money for government failing to provide her an employment.

For record, establishment-wise, the Indian Army is the biggest employment provider in India with over 14 lakh personnel, followed by the Railways at around 13 lakh and postal department at about 4.26 lakh. In private sector Infosys, TeamLease and Reliance Industries have around or more than 2 lakh employees after the Quess Corp and the TCS.

Career in Law: 4 career trends reshaping the legal industry,"Here are some career trends that will tranform the legal industry in upcoming years.

Change is the law of nature, and we all know that those who adapt to the change grow! Taking the legal industry into consideration, the demands and expectations of clients have taken new heights. These heightened expectations have shaped on account of the paradigm shift our world is going through. In this digital age, people rely on technological tools in the professional world which makes hi-tech career trends a neccessity in all fields, especially legal industry.

There have been a number of high-tech discoveries and automation trends in the past few years; and, luckily for the legal industry, these trends promise to bring more connectivity, agility, and a more streamlined way of handling business.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some of these trends that can help you be ready and ahead of the competition:

1. E-Discoveries

We are lining in a digital age, and the way we connect to each other has changed altogether. Today, more and more people rely on electronic devices to share information through chats, emails, voicemails, social media, and e-calendars.

In order to streamline the process of finding relevant materials for the cases, the practitioners are now allowed to consider ESI (Electronically stored information); this new process is referred to as e- discovery‚Äô or electronic discovery‚Äô.

By including the e-discovery process as a part of practice, the lawyers can make the litigation process to be much more streamlined and less stressful going forward.

2. Social Media

Social media, needless to say, has become a part of our everyday life. It has changed the way we consume information and carry our several other tasks, including job hunt and career management.

Today, new graduates can look for available jobs through social networking sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Several law firms now post jobs on their pages to reach more deserving clients, which works in the favor of job hunters as well.

The same is very effective for individually practicing lawyers (along with firms) to find new clients, interact with them and investigate clients to some level.

These social networking sites, further, will play an important role in helping firms and individual legal professionals expand their network and reach a larger audience through the means of advertising and personal branding.

3. Virtual law firms and outsourcing

We have already seen websites up and running in the past 2-3 years. However, 2020 is the year when we are more likely to see completely virtual law firms. The end goal is to make easy connections and ride the globalization‚Äô bandwagon.

So, the benefit of these virtual law firms is two-fold. The first advantage is customer-focused, where clients can seek out legal professional help and advice through the web (or mobile), without having to visit in person initially.

The second advantage is improved business model for the firms and practitioners, as virtual setup allows cross-country law firms to team up together as one firm in many cases and makes outsourcing easier.

Everything considered, virtualization and the ease of carrying out virtual meetings is making it more convenient and reliable for law firms to outsource their work to external vendors like individual attorneys, paralegals, and other support professionals.

This new trend is picking up fast, and it will not only help firms expand their capabilities but is also likely to reduce cost, improve flexibility and open up better opportunities for new job seekers.

4. Cyber Security

With fast-paced digitization, legal industry ought to focus more on cyber security. Several organizations, in every sector, usually overlook the importance of security. In a similar case, a 40-year old Panamanian law firm called MossacFonesca was forced to shut down after a security breach that led to over 11 million client case files being leaked.

Sure, digitization is paving a way for businesses to expand horizons, but it is also making them more vulnerable to hacking and phishing attacks. So, in order to stay in sync with the trends, the legal industry needs to meet the increasing demand for security solutions as well. In the light of the same, blockchain is one such solution that is likely to pick pace in legal as well as other industries to bring about cyber security by the way of decentralization.

Advice for students and young professionals

Understanding the laws under course curriculum is only one part, it is vital to stay updated and acquaint yourself with the changing trends to stay ahead of the game. Are you ready for the change? Collaboration, critical thinking, flexibility and inter disciplinary approach will enable you to soar greater heights. So use your law school learning and mentoring at the fullest.

All the best!

"Tripura govt to accommodate 10,000 teachers in non-teaching jobs","Amid massive agitations by 10,323 Tripura government teachers to keep their jobs, the BJP state government announced to absorb the teachers in various state government departments.

Amid massive agitations by 10,323 Tripura government teachers to keep their jobs, the BJP state government on Thursday announced to absorb the teachers in various state government departments, a minister said after a Cabinet meeting. The 10,323 Tripura government teachers are facing termination of jobs due to the Supreme Court and High Court orders citing ""discrepancies in recruitment"". Tripura Education and Law Minister Ratan Lal Nath said that the residual numbers of teaching personnel of 8,882 among the 10,323 Tripura government teachers would be absorbed in various departments against the vacant posts of 10,618.

Termination is due to discrepancies in recruitment, as per court order

""Before appointing the 8,882 teachers in non-teaching jobs of other departments, the state government would seek the permission of the Supreme Court as the apex court earlier cancelled their jobs,"" the minister said after the meeting of the council of ministers headed by Chief Minister Biplab Kumar Deb.

Nath said the issue of the 10,323 government teachers' jobs was discussed on humanitarian grounds and considered the livelihood of 50,000 people, including the family members of these teachers facing termination of jobs.

""The previous Left Front government did not follow the first orders of the High Court in 2011 causing the termination of thousands of government teachers,"" the minister claimed. ""A serious situation has arisen as thousands of teachers are assembling during their ongoing agitation in the capital despite the restrictions promulgated in view of the COVID-19,"" he added.

Global HR professionals rank English communication as vital skill: TOEIC study,"The TOEIC¬Æ programme has released the results of a new study of human resources (HR) professionals through a report, English Communication Skills for the Modern Economy: The Value of Quality Data to Support Talent Decisions. The report presents data from a survey of more than 800 HR professionals from global corporations across 13 countries and measures the significance of English communication skills in the workplace while exploring the trends and preferences of HR managers for English-language assessments.

The study shows that HR managers believe English communication skills are critical to the success of their business and 94% believe they will only grow in importance, said Soumitra Roy, General Manager India and SAARC, Prometric Testing Private Limited. Given the high demand among companies to cultivate a workforce with the ability to perform vital work tasks in English rather than just understand linguistics in English HR managers are looking for reliable assessment tools to support talent management decisions that will enable them to thrive in today‚Äôs marketplace.

TOEIC programme, a standardized assessment of English language

Accurate English communication measurement provides hiring professionals with a cost-effective tool to deliver quality data that they can rely on when making recruitment, placement and promotion decisions, said Roy.

The TOEIC programme meets this demand by providing quality-based, standardized assessments that help corporations in India elevate the workforce, organizations and reputation of the country worldwide.

The TOEIC programme is becoming increasingly more popular in India with many top corporations relying on the TOEIC programme to ensure they are hiring and promoting employees with the workplace English skills necessary to help their organizations successfully compete in the global workplace.

HR across globe trusts TOEIC

According to the report, corporations select independently developed, standardized assessments more frequently than any other evaluation method. Furthermore, 79% of HR professionals want internationally recognized test scores that are an accurate evaluation of English-language skills and provide consistency, reliability and fairness, while reflecting real-life work scenarios relevant to organizational needs.

Career in Data Analytics: 4 non-technical aspects people don't think about,"Certain universal truths cannot be denied. The sun will always rise in the east and set in the west. The earth will continue to revolve around the sun for the next 5 billion years. Free from any impurities, water is always tasteless, colourless, and odourless. Here‚Äôs another fact that has recently made its way into this club of truisms: the world is, and will increasingly be, driven by data.

You probably didn‚Äôt see that coming, did you? I‚Äôll posit that the only reason we don‚Äôt pay such close attention to data is because of the sheer quantum of it surrounding us today. In 2018, IBM estimated that more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data were generated across the globe every day.

The reason behind generating a huge amount of data

Because every action we take, every action we don‚Äôt take, every bit of content that we consume, share or reject all of it adds to the massive and growing pile of information that is created every second of every day. Data is like air essential, yet invisible and we can‚Äôt seem to stop generating it.

And, with the growing integration of digital technologies and IoT devices in our lives, the speed of data creation is only set to accelerate in the future.

Marketing, strategic decision-making, sales, human resources, supply chain management each and every business function is actively being touched and redefined by data.

Naturally, with such a data inundation comes transformation. Enterprises are already tapping into the benefits that a data-centric approach can deliver for their business and are eagerly building their data capabilities to capture the opportunity that looms just over the horizon.

Marketing, strategic decision-making, sales, human resources, supply chain management each and every business function is actively being touched and redefined by data.

Data is changing the job landscape

It is also changing the jobs landscape. We now have specialised roles such as data specialists, data architects, and for large enterprises even Chief Data Officers (CDOs). For professionals, the field of data analytics and business intelligence is interesting and lucrative; data-related roles such as data scientist have been consistently highlighted amongst the most promising jobs of the future and currently offer the highest median salaries across the globe.

So, what do you need to benefit from the opportunity that this high-growth sector represents? There are a thousand and one informative blogs about the technical skills that you can acquire to become a data professional. This is why I will focus on the softer aspects, learnt from my personal experiences in this domain that will help you craft a career in the field of data analytics:

Tips to build a career in data analytics.

Tips to build a career in data analytics

1. Question everything: One of the biggest learnings that I‚Äôve had in my career is the need to question everything. It is the part and parcel of the job to identify how to take a process that is working perfectly fine and make it better. This is why a data professional can never, ever, ever be satisfied with the status quo nor should they be. Inculcate a habit of evaluating everything that you observe and use data to back up your observations. The analysis at all times starts with you.

2. Be curious to learn as much as you can: The ability to constantly learn and augment one‚Äôs knowledge base is a skill that is of the utmost importance to a data professional. The field itself is dynamic, fast-evolving, ever-changing. To succeed, you will need to stay in step with or maybe even ahead of its evolutionary curve. And the only way to do that is to constantly learn, unlearn, and relearn.

3. Adopt flexibility, agility, adaptability as your mantras: As a data professional, you must remember that there is no fixed path to finding solutions to problems. 1+4‚Äô is just as much a 5‚Äô as 2+3‚Äô is, which is just as much a 5‚Äô as 1+1+2+1‚Äô. Even if the end-objective achieved is the same, sometimes one solution works better than the other one. This is why you need to have a flexible and agile mindset that can break down a large problem statement into multiple smaller parts and figure out the solution that delivers the best results. It is also essential to be ready to switch from an idea that initially worked but no longer does, or to try newer ideas that might work better. The question isn‚Äôt if‚Äô; it is how‚Äô.

4. Simplify the complexity for others: You might be a wizard when it comes to analysing data, but it will amount to little if that analysis cannot be translated into simple, actionable insights that can be used by the end-user be it a client or an internal stakeholder. Look at how you can simplify and personalise your analytics reports as per the needs of your end-user. Do it constantly and it will become second nature. The objective is to help your end-user make the best decisions backed by data-driven insights that they can readily understand and implement.

Let‚Äôs end as we began: with another universal truth. Change or, better yet, entropy will always be the only constant. As a data professional, your entire job revolves around how to best navigate that change, make life simpler for everyone who depends on you and add value to processes and functions.

Cultivating these soft skills can help you achieve these objectives and complement your technical skillsets to create a lucrative career trajectory in this specialised, high-growth field.

Career in Law: 4 career trends reshaping the legal industry,"Here are some career trends that will tranform the legal industry in upcoming years.

Change is the law of nature, and we all know that those who adapt to the change grow! Taking the legal industry into consideration, the demands and expectations of clients have taken new heights. These heightened expectations have shaped on account of the paradigm shift our world is going through. In this digital age, people rely on technological tools in the professional world which makes hi-tech career trends a neccessity in all fields, especially legal industry.

There have been a number of high-tech discoveries and automation trends in the past few years; and, luckily for the legal industry, these trends promise to bring more connectivity, agility, and a more streamlined way of handling business.

Let‚Äôs take a look at some of these trends that can help you be ready and ahead of the competition:

1. E-Discoveries

We are lining in a digital age, and the way we connect to each other has changed altogether. Today, more and more people rely on electronic devices to share information through chats, emails, voicemails, social media, and e-calendars.

In order to streamline the process of finding relevant materials for the cases, the practitioners are now allowed to consider ESI (Electronically stored information); this new process is referred to as e- discovery‚Äô or electronic discovery‚Äô.

By including the e-discovery process as a part of practice, the lawyers can make the litigation process to be much more streamlined and less stressful going forward.

2. Social Media

Social media, needless to say, has become a part of our everyday life. It has changed the way we consume information and carry our several other tasks, including job hunt and career management.

Today, new graduates can look for available jobs through social networking sites like LinkedIn and Facebook. Several law firms now post jobs on their pages to reach more deserving clients, which works in the favor of job hunters as well.

The same is very effective for individually practicing lawyers (along with firms) to find new clients, interact with them and investigate clients to some level.

These social networking sites, further, will play an important role in helping firms and individual legal professionals expand their network and reach a larger audience through the means of advertising and personal branding.

3. Virtual law firms and outsourcing

We have already seen websites up and running in the past 2-3 years. However, 2020 is the year when we are more likely to see completely virtual law firms. The end goal is to make easy connections and ride the globalization‚Äô bandwagon.

So, the benefit of these virtual law firms is two-fold. The first advantage is customer-focused, where clients can seek out legal professional help and advice through the web (or mobile), without having to visit in person initially.

The second advantage is improved business model for the firms and practitioners, as virtual setup allows cross-country law firms to team up together as one firm in many cases and makes outsourcing easier.

Everything considered, virtualization and the ease of carrying out virtual meetings is making it more convenient and reliable for law firms to outsource their work to external vendors like individual attorneys, paralegals, and other support professionals.

This new trend is picking up fast, and it will not only help firms expand their capabilities but is also likely to reduce cost, improve flexibility and open up better opportunities for new job seekers.

4. Cyber Security

With fast-paced digitization, legal industry ought to focus more on cyber security. Several organizations, in every sector, usually overlook the importance of security. In a similar case, a 40-year old Panamanian law firm called MossacFonesca was forced to shut down after a security breach that led to over 11 million client case files being leaked.

Sure, digitization is paving a way for businesses to expand horizons, but it is also making them more vulnerable to hacking and phishing attacks. So, in order to stay in sync with the trends, the legal industry needs to meet the increasing demand for security solutions as well. In the light of the same, blockchain is one such solution that is likely to pick pace in legal as well as other industries to bring about cyber security by the way of decentralization.

Advice for students and young professionals

Understanding the laws under course curriculum is only one part, it is vital to stay updated and acquaint yourself with the changing trends to stay ahead of the game. Are you ready for the change? Collaboration, critical thinking, flexibility and inter disciplinary approach will enable you to soar greater heights. So use your law school learning and mentoring at the fullest.

All the best!

US airlines call for payroll protections as aid talks continue,"An airplane takes off from the Ronald Reagan National Airport as air traffic is affected by the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), in Washington, U.S., March 18, 2020.

US airlines called on Friday for a government stimulus package to help them weather the coronavirus crisis by providing payroll protections, warning that around 750,000 jobs depend on the airline industry.

A Republican proposal introduced in the U.S. Senate on Thursday would grant up to $50 billion in secured loans, but bars the cash grants the airlines had requested, spurring intense discussions between airlines, unions and congressional aides over the shape of the aid.

Loans alone are not sufficient and should be coupled with a worker payroll assistance program and targeted tax relief which will allow airlines to keep operating through this crisis, industry body Airlines for America said in a statement.

United Airlines Holdings Inc and American Airlines Group Inc displayed a united front with their unions, together asking employees to write letters to Congress urging action.

Chicago-based United warned that without sufficient government support by the end of March, it would have to start cutting its payroll to match a 60% schedule reduction planned for April, saying time is running out.

Late on Friday, United said it was now cutting 95% of its international flights in April, including suspending all flights next month to Canada, Europe, Central and South America and Africa and nearly all flights in Asia.

Airlines have already raised capital, suspended share buybacks, cut executive pay, slashed flights and grounded jets to reduce costs and preserve cash during a steep erosion in air travel demand.

Even with those self-help measures, Delta Air Lines Inc Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Friday his airline was burning through $50 million in cash each day. Delta expects its revenue to fall by $10 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier.

U.S. President Donald Trump has said he stands ready to support the industry, but the idea of a bailout has met with a backlash from some critics who argue the airlines should have saved more cash for a rainy day, rather than rewarding shareholders.

Whatever they ask for will be very controversial, said Al Koch, vice chairman of AlixPartners, who was involved in the restructuring of General Motors in 2008-09. It‚Äôs one thing for Trump to say we‚Äôll stand behind airlines, and another thing for Congress to enact something into law.

Meanwhile, union groups continued to lobby for any stimulus package to guarantee protections for frontline employees.

To protect workers, Association of Flight Attendants-CWA President Sara Nelson is pushing for direct payroll subsidies for employees, ranging from wheelchair assistants and gate agents to mechanics and flight attendants.

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Friday, a dozen lawmakers said that basic protections for frontline workers, including contractors, were a moral obligation, but added that airlines should not receive a blank check.

Talks in Congress concluded Friday without an agreement, but congressional negotiators will resume talks on Saturday.

Special Ops Review: An overly-stretched espionage thriller,"Do us a favour and take a rubber band. Now stretch it, a little more, now some more. Here, these are the first five episodes of the Hotstar series Special Ops. The next three are far better in terms of pace and manage to generate interest but it is too late by then. Not even the fancy titles do any good. The damage has been done. Over and out.

Neeraj Pandey, the man associated with some of the most fantastic Bollywood thrillers (A Wednesday, Special 26, Baby) has co-written the series along with Deepak Kingrani and Benazir Ali. He is also the co-director along with Shivam Nair.

Because of Neeraj Pandey, one might expect it to be a cleverly crafted series with great twists. Much like what we all felt in Special 26, when an entire team of officers was revealed to be a mere distraction. But then, he is also the man who gave us a disaster in the form of Aiyaary. And Special Ops is more like Aiyaary (sadly) with its forced slow-motion scenes, predictable twists, absence of logic and poorly executed story.

This doesn‚Äôt mean that there are no elements that don‚Äôt match his successful works. We have an Old Delhi setup in the first episode that reminds us heavily of Baby and Special 26. Then there is the classic cat-and-mouse chase, an officer who is unafraid of his seniors, undercover agents, code words, interrogations, mention of real-life events etc. However, despite all this, Special Ops lacks the ability to engage us. The climax gives that 'thrill‚Äô for a moment though, but also leaves us with questions that are never answered.

The makers try to pique interest with excessive background music. Much like the fighting scenes which weren‚Äôt needed at all.

Talking about the story, we are taken to the life of Himmat Singh (Kay Kay Menon), a RAW officer who isn‚Äôt afraid of defying orders if it serves the interest of the nation. An internal audit inquiry is being conducted on him and he is asked to account for the huge amount of money spent from the government funds. While initially, this captures attention (never before has an officer been inquired), it gradually becomes tiring.

Through the inquiry, Himmat reveals that according to him, there was a sixth man, named Ikhlaq Khan, who was the mastermind behind the Parliament terror attack of December 13, 2001. While others refuse to believe that the man even exists, Himmat has been trying to track him since then and has five undercover agents placed in different parts of the world for the same.

The agents are Farooq Ali (Karan Tacker), Ruhani Syed Khan (Meher Vij), Balakrishna Reddy (Vipul Gupta), Avinash (Muzzamil Ibrahim), and Juhi Kashyap (Saiyami Kher). While a lot of screen time, as well as backstory, is given to Farooq, not much is revealed about the other four. They are there just because the writers needed them. Much like certain events that had to happen, in order to pave the way for the climax.

On the upside, Special Ops has some excellent performances. Kay Kay Menon is fantastic as an officer who doesn‚Äôt lose his calm even in the hardest of times. He is also a protective (sometimes overly) father and a loving husband. Menon‚Äôs expressions go from soft to intense within seconds and it is a delight to see him on the screen.

Karan Tacker does a fine job as agent Farooq and looks dashing throughout the series.

Others including Vipul Gupta, Muzammil Ibrahim, Saiyami Kher, Meher Vij, Divya Dutta, Vinay Pathak and Sharad Kelkar do full justice to their roles.

As much as we hate to say it, Neeraj Pandey‚Äôs Special Ops is not a binge-watch worthy thriller. If you have the patience to sit through the first five episodes, you just might enjoy the last three. But aren't there enough thrillers available already?",https://www.indiatoday.in/television/web-series/story/special-ops-review-an-overly-stretched-espionage-thriller-1658100-2020-03-21,
"Judgments don't win Rajya Sabha seats, not my aim to be minister: Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi","Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi said on Thursday that it was not his aim to become a minister. In an exclusive interview to India Today TV after taking oath as a Rajya Sabha MP, Ranjan Gogoi said that, if possible, he would not take the salary as a Member of Parliament.

On being asked about why did he accept the nomination to Rajya Sabha, he said, ""My answer is why not. I accepted the nomination for the same reason I accept the judgeship at the age of 45 when I had a lucrative practice. There is a practice in the bar that when a judgeship is offered you don't refuse. When the President makes an offer, you don't refuse.""

""So far as the cooling period is concerned, tell me under what law cooling period can be visualised? When you apply a law, apply it across the board, don't apply it on a case to case basis. How do you then man the tribunals, which are headed by retired Supreme Court judges?"" the former CJI asked.

On being asked about his remark in March 2019 claiming that post-retirement appointment is a scar on the judiciary, Ranjan Gogoi said, ""Do you think Rajya Sabha seat is a job, do you think it is a post-retirement rehabilitation? My statement was in the context of a judgment which dealt with tribunalisation - that's a job.""

The former CJI said that he was not surprised by the walkout staged by the opposition during his swearing-in.

""It was expected, it was building up for the last two days - opposition parties walk out and walk in, I don't understand how that can upset any reasonable person,"" he said.

Reacting on the allegations that his appointment to Rajya Sabha was quid pro quo by the Modi government for some of his recent judgments, Ranjan Gogoi that these statements made him wonder if they amounted to contempt of court. ""Did I write those judgments alone? The other judges who were with me, what were they doing, were they not participating. And if it was a quid pro quo for the appointments, they are collectively responsible.""

""Is it a rule that only if you write five judgments against the government then only you are eligible for nomination to the Rajya Sabha under Article 80. If you write judgments which turnout eventually in the favour of the government, do you become ineligible?"" he asked.

""C'mon, if it was a quid pro quo, we would not have stopped at Rajya Sabha membership. If the rules permit, I would not take any salary for the Rajya Sabha membership,"" Ranjan Gogoi said.

After indicating that Rajya Sabha nomination was not a lucrative post, the former CJI clarified that he was not interested in becoming a minister. ""I have seen ministers in family seen I was a kid and I can tell you I am not interested in becoming one,"" Ranjan Gogoi said. However, when asked if he will reject the offer, he said he is not expecting an offer to ever come his way.

""I am neither a politician nor a leader. I was asked by the President to enlighten the Rajya Sabha debates with something I have been working on for the past 40 years of my life. I have no intention of getting into politics, joining a party, becoming a minister, but once in awhile I would like to participate in the discussions to the extent that the judiciary's point of view can be reflected,"" Ranjan Gogoi said.

I have been thinking about how participating in Rajya Sabha amounts to comprising the independence of the judiciary.

While dismissing the allegations that executive and judiciary were in connivance, he also argued that the two branches of the contribution should also not be at the loggerheads, ""that would lead us nowhere"".

""If executive tries to interfere in the judiciary it should be violently condemned, but the public is not aware of real reasons of the actions [like transfer of Justice Muralidhar in the middle of the riots], as it will not be in the public interest. That is why I say, trust your judges, don't suspect them,"" Ranjan Gogoi said.",https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/won-t-take-salary-not-my-aim-to-be-minister-ex-cji-ranjan-gogoi-1657605-2020-03-19,

Tripura govt teachers protest against termination of jobs,"A section of around 10,323 Tripura government teachers, facing termination of jobs due to court orders, continued their uninterrupted 48-hours demonstration on Sunday demanding alternative arrangements to keep their jobs, a leader of the teacher's body said. Leader of the agitating teachers Bimal Saha and other teachers told the media on Sunday that they would intensify their agitations if the state's BJP-led government does not take steps to protect their jobs.

What are the teachers saying?

Mr Saha, who is the President of the 'All Tripura 10,323 Ad-hoc Teachers' Association' told the media that so far 50 teachers had ""died or committed suicide"". He said the state government should provide a job to the family members of those 50 teachers who have died.

The teachers said the BJP leaders before the 2018 assembly elections had promised in their 'Vision Document' and electoral campaigns to protect the jobs of the government teachers. Over 10,323 government teachers with graduate, post-graduate and under-graduate educational qualifications were inducted into the Tripura government schools in different phases since 2010 when the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M)-led Left Front government was in power.

What went wrong?

The recruitment of these teachers subsequently went to litigation and the Tripura High Court in 2014 terminated all the 10,323 teachers, saying the selection criterion contained ""discrepancies"". Thereafter, Special Leave Petitions were filed in the Supreme Court by the then Left Front government and a section of teachers. But the apex court upheld the High Court verdict on March 29, 2017.

Following an appeal by the previous Left Front government, the apex court extended their services up to June last year. After coming to power in March last year, the BJP-led government had filed a fresh appeal in the Supreme Court and the apex court had granted them a one-time final extension of their services till March 2020.

An official of the Education Department said though several teachers have been absorbed in other government positions and through separate recruitment processes, including Teachers Eligibility Tests (TET), most of them are facing job losses.

"70000 youths recruited in Haryana govt jobs through HPSC, HSSC in last 5 yrs: CM Manohar Lal Khattar","Stressing the need for merit-based selection in government jobs to ensure an effective and efficient system of governance, Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday said about 70,000 youngsters were recruited through the HPSC and the HSSC in the state in the last five years.

He also said his government had adopted a transparent recruitment policy. Speaking as the chief guest at the inaugural session of the 22nd National Conference of State Public Service Commissions here, Khattar said his government had scrapped the interview process for Classes 3 and 4 posts, according to an official release.

He said his government had recognised the talent of the candidates, ""which the previous government neglected"".

He added that most of the recruitment made during the previous regimes were facing litigation but contrary to this, as a result of the transparent recruitment policy adopted by the current BJP-led state government, candidates were being selected in government jobs in a fair manner, without any irregularities.

Khattar congratulated the Haryana Public Service Commission (HPSC) and the Haryana Staff Selection Commission (HSSC) for adopting such a ""flawless"" system.

He exhorted the recruitment agencies for all-out efforts to make the selection process more transparent.

The BJP leader said his government was continuously working towards building a transparent system of recruitment in Haryana.

""It is for the first time that the state government has eliminated the interview process. Apart from this, we are also going to implement another reform under which the names of only those HCS or Class-1 officers would be sent to the UPSC for selection as IAS officers, who would clear the written examination to be conducted by the HPSC,"" he said.

The chief minister said it was the result of the atmosphere created by his government that the percentage of candidates from the state passing prestigious examinations likes the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET), JEE and other engineering examinations was continuously increasing.

He said though population wise Haryana was comparatively a small state, ""yet, on an average, 40 candidates are clearing the IAS exam (from the state) every year"".

Hailing the contribution of recruitment agencies, including the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), in selecting meritorious candidates, Khattar said their work was like that of a jeweller who had to choose the best gems.

He said there was a need for these agencies to bring about effective changes in their system, keeping in view the changing times.

Speaking on the occasion, UPSC Chairman Arvind Saxena said the state public service commissions had a mandate for making competition-based selections and providing a secure and stable civil service that was necessary for transparent and impartial governance.

He said in two recent instances -- the lateral entry scheme for joint secretary-level officers of the government of India and empanelment of DGPs for states and Union territories -- the Centre and the Supreme Court had reposed faith in the UPSC for carrying out fair and transparent selections purely on merit basis.

Govt jobs as most prefered option among youngsters

Saxena said as it was a fact that government jobs were a more preferable option among youngsters, ""the challenge before us is to select the most suitable candidates in a transparent manner, re-design and improve our systems and make the competitive examinations less stressful for the candidates"".

HPSC Chairman R K Pachnanda said the commission had adopted several measures to ensure a free-and-fair selection process, ""which enables us to select good, meritorious candidates who would perform their duties judiciously and lead to a better system of administration and governance"".

Job seekers with serious mental illnesses believe poor physical health makes it difficult to find jobs,"In a recent study, researchers find that people with serious mental illness believe their physical health problems rather than psychological health make it difficult for them to find jobs. There are a lot of people living with mental illnesses in the world, especially in the United States. Usually, the lack of job and stress of finding a job can heighten the person's anxiety and make their mental health worse than before.

According to the lead author Ni Gao, an associate professor at Rutgers School of Health Professions, ""The study underscores the urgent need for integrated mental health and physical health care for people with serious mental illness, especially those with long-term, chronic conditions.""

The Rutgers study was published in the Journal of Vocational Rehabilitation.

""Without addressing physical health problems, people with serious mental illness will continue to experience more health problems and diseases and do not seek employment that could improve their quality of life,"" he added.

About 11.4 million U.S. adults have a serious mental illness -- such as schizophrenia, anxiety, major depression and bipolar disorder -- and up to 90 percent are unemployed, with about three million that are dependent on public assistance, including Supplemental Security Income and Social Security Disability Insurance.

Goal of the study

Chronic unemployment is a major concern since it can exasperate stress, anxiety, depression and cardiovascular disease and reduce access to the care they need to manage their physical and mental conditions.

The goal of the Rutgers study was to better understand how a person's perception of their mental and physical health affects job seeking. The study was funded by a grant by the National Institute on Disability, Independent Living and Rehabilitation Research of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Researchers met over one year with 162 people with serious mental illness living in supportive housing programs.

At each meeting, they assessed the participants' physical health and employment-related activities, such as the number of applications submitted, interviews they had gone to, job offers that were made and what these individuals identified as their barrier to getting a job.

Almost half of the participants had a high school diploma and 27 percent were college-educated. About 60 percent had not been employed during the previous five years, but all expressed a desire to seek employment when enrolled in the study.

Results of the study

In each of the monthly check-ins, 11 to 26 percent of the participants reported that their long-term physical health conditions - such as diabetes, chronic pain and obesity - prevented them from job seeking versus zero to 2 percent who reported barriers due to long-term mental illness, such as lack of energy in the job seeking due to depression or anxiety symptoms.

According to Gao, people with serious mental illness often do not receive the same physical care as the general public for many reasons, such as lack access to high-quality and affordable health care, and physical health problems of this population often being under-recognized and under-treated by health care providers.

""Studies have shown that the life expectancy of people with serious mental illness may be reduced by up to 25 years compared with the general population, but that employment may be one of key elements to improving and maintaining both their mental health and physical health,"" he said.

""Employment increases their resources for better living conditions and access to quality health care, promotes positive self-identity and peer respect. These are people who are unemployed despite having a desire to work,"" Gao added.

Therefore, the integration of mental health, physical health and vocational rehabilitation for this underserved group deserve public attention, she said.

"Divide and rule: Job creation, not reservation, is the antidote for the unemployment crisis","The resurrection of the caste census demand exemplifies how the political class flogs tired old ideas in response to contemporary socio-economic and political challenges. With Census operations beginning, Bihar and Maharashtra legislative assemblies have pressed for counting caste numbers. On a parallel track, the Justice Rohini Commission for sub-categorisation of OBCs has sought data from the UPA-2 era socio-economic caste census to fine tune its recommendations. Centre hasn‚Äôt shown any interest in either claim and rightly so.

The political demand for caste census rests on hopes of resurrecting identity politics centred around greater reservation for OBCs. Amid the ongoing economic slowdown, pro-reservationists are ignoring the diminishing returns from quotas with the job pie shrinking. Rather than frittering energies on maximising quota benefits for caste groups, politicians should focus on employment generation through economic reforms and quality education. Such efforts collectively lift the whole population from poverty. Unfortunately, another election year in Bihar is leading to duels between JD(U) and RJD over the caste card.

With religion playing out strongly in Indian politics many of today‚Äôs jaded opposition politicians want caste to become the trump card again. But that moment has passed by. After two decades of Mandal implementation many OBC groups paused to wonder how they benefited, sending Lohiaite parties into a tailspin. Reserving jobs for locals is another populist stunt. BJP hasn‚Äôt done much better with a sub-categorisation card, for which the Justice Rohini Commission was hurriedly trotted out and then left hanging. The slicing and dicing of voters, jobs and higher education is furthering social divides with grievances fast reaching a breaking point. Votaries of reservation are mistaken in believing that strength lies in caste numbers. No quota policy can sate even a small fraction of today‚Äôs mushrooming army of unemployed youth. Talk job creation now, reservation has had its day.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/divide-and-rule-job-creation-not-reservation-is-the-antidote-for-the-unemployment-crisis/,
Solving the jobs crisis: Here are three things government must do and three things individuals can do,"India‚Äôs jobs crisis is, ironically, worst among urban and educated youth, something you would imagine would be an advantage in the job market. It is now time to get into solution mode and not turn this one into a political blame game as we often do with our national issues. The reasons for the crisis include some of our own mistakes and some global trends. However, if we want to solve the problem, there is only one thing that beats a job crisis ‚Äì a super high growth economy.

Hence, if we as Indians want to solve this crisis, we need a new collective goal. Let‚Äôs call this goal GDP10, or growing the economy at 10%. We average around 7% now. Getting to 10% is challenging but not impossible. It is a huge number but this is what it will take to create jobs for the large number of educated urban youth.

Also, if we do achieve this mammoth goal we won‚Äôt just solve the unemployment problem. GDP10 will also create a lot of other benefits. These include a higher standard of living and per capita income for Indians; more government revenues that can be used for various welfare schemes; rise in savings and investments; higher FDI inflows and increased clout for India on the world stage.

Here are three, specific and doable ways to grow our GDP much faster than at present:

A massive investment in agro-industry to add value to agricultural produce. While we can become a manufacturing hub by importing raw materials and exporting products, there is nothing like using the raw material widely available in India ‚Äì agricultural produce. The problem is we don‚Äôt add enough value to this produce. Wine made from grapes sells for a lot more than the grapes themselves. Fine cheese sells for multiples more than the milk itself. Yet, why is Swiss cheese considered the best in the world? I can understand if we cannot make the best warplanes or telecom equipment. But cheese, seriously? We can‚Äôt make the world‚Äôs best cheese? Or jams? Or organic superfoods that have become a revolution worldwide?

Great agro-industry needs excellent quality, world-class packaging and of course the right marketing. All this does need an infrastructure. However, it also needs a mindset. That we are growing gold in this country, we just don‚Äôt know how to polish and sell it. We live with mediocrity, and that‚Äôs just not good enough for agri-produce on the world stage. Impact of this on GDP growth: 1-2% plus.

Make our own Singapore and Hong Kong. The example of Hong Kong is particularly relevant. As a pure capitalist city with among the most business-friendly laws in the world the territory is a part of China, but doesn‚Äôt have to deal with the onerous regulations there. However, Hong Kong tremendously adds to Chinese growth as a financial, trading and business hub. We have no city in India that is truly free. The state government, municipal bodies and Central entities come and choke every city, preventing the development of a world-class city.

We need at least one, if not four cities that are modelled on Hong Kong and Singapore. Special laws of Parliament should enable these cities to have a lot more freedom, and these laws should be stable and unchangeable irrespective of which government is in power. Cities with a port and a reasonable infrastructure to begin with, such as Vizag, Kochi, Porbandar and Puducherry are all good candidates. Impact on GDP Growth: 1-2% plus.

The world‚Äôs best airline and airport hub. Again this is a finite and doable project. Not only will this project generate enormous employment it will also, once done, move a lot of global traffic through India. This will boost trade, tourism and linkages with the world, again contributing to our growth rates. Impact: 1-2% plus.

Alongside GDP growth, it is important to note that the skills the jobs of tomorrow will require are going to be dramatically different from those of the past. We will also need to revamp education systems, and in particular launch courses to fit the jobs of tomorrow. Nobody really knows what the job market in 20 years will look like. It will be vastly different from today, probably impacted by technologies such as artificial intelligence. We can have a focus on such programmes. This will mean allowing foreign universities to come into India, with their experience and talent in adapting to the times.

Meanwhile, if you are an individual facing the job crisis directly here are some tips, as the macro changes above will require a long time to take effect:

Learn networking. You have to learn to market yourself. If you need a job, find ways to be around people who have jobs in your industry. Volunteer at conferences, attend events and set up meetings with as many people as possible. Use technology. Your phone is not just to watch videos and chat with your friends. Use it to find contacts and establish connections with people who can give you a job.

Tell your parents not to spend a massive amount on your wedding. No matter how amazing the wedding party, people will either forget it or your relatives will get jealous. Instead, consider using that money as capital for a new startup business venture.

Learn skills that are needed. Watch the job market and see what they want. Keep learning, even outside school or college. Use your time to look for a job. Oh, and do not be addicted to your phone.

Together, let‚Äôs make it our job ‚Äì to solve the jobs crisis!",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/The-underage-optimist/solving-the-jobs-crisis-here-are-three-things-government-must-do-and-three-things-individuals-can-do/,

LUCKNOW: Calling the prevalent levels of unemployment in the country ‚Äústructural‚Äù, state MSME minister Sidharth Nath Singh said that PM Narendra Modi ‚Äôs attempts at streamlining India‚Äôs parallel economy had led to some disruptions but these interventions would lead to more jobs.‚ÄúIndia is experiencing a disruptive economy, where new technology and innovation has entered the economy. Unemployment, as is being reported in the media, is structural unemployment. It means that blue or white collared jobs from 9 to 5, like bankers, doctors, engineers, government officials, can‚Äôt be seen. In India, the mindset is such that if these jobs are not available, people feel that there is something wrong with the economy,‚Äù he said.Speaking at a skill development programme on Friday, Singh said people were worrying about the GDP at 5% but that was due to global recession.However, the process to formalise the parallel economy through means like demonetisation and GST would create more jobs.Giving the example of Digital India programme, Singh said that under PM Gramin Digitial India project, 1.25 lakh gram panchayats had been connected via optical fibre cables. ‚ÄúThat itself created jobs but now to maintain and operate these, we need skilled people,‚Äù he said.Mahendra Nath Pandey, the Union MSME minister, added that India‚Äôs population would prove to be a boon in the coming days, especially as the country had a predominantly young population. ‚ÄúIn Japan, where a major part of the population is old, they are preferring Indians to go and work, especially since unlike residents of other Southeast Asian countries, Indians don‚Äôt stay on,‚Äù he said.The minister announced that he had convinced the UP chief minister to give land at no cost for setting up of schools on plumbing and driving. ‚ÄúUnion minister Nitin Gadkari said India needs 22 lakh trained drivers and by 2024, the Centre will ensure piped water to all houses. Therefore, drivers and plumbers will be in huge demand,‚Äù he said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/minister-says-employment-crisis-in-india-structural/articleshow/71657312.cms,

It took 20 years for 49-year-old Selvaraj M to become a skilled worker in a pumpset manufacturing unit. The resident of Peelamedu could deftly wind the copper coils and assemble the parts of a pumpset, but now he works in a tiffin stall and takes home a much smaller pay. In the past year, with increasing competition from bigger brands and introduction of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), small and micro units have been struggling to keep their business going and keeping their staff together.The textile hub of Tirupur has also felt the pinch of job cuts and the gloom of unemployment pervades Sivakasi where firecracker units stare at a bleak future because of clampdown on manufacture of polluting fireworks. It‚Äôs not just industrial hubs, unemployment has been growing across Tamil Nadu. The problem is multi-fold ‚Äî growing population, slowing economy and lack of skill development options to make graduates employable. The churn in IT industry, with advancement in automation and artificial intelligence , has impacted job potential further.This is a concern across India, which makes both the party in power and the opposition promise to work for a brighter future. With nine lakh first-time voters from Tamil Nadu, parties in their manifestos have been careful to talk about education and job creation. Maufacturers, who make up a sizeable population, have also created pressure on political parties. ""We have sent representations to all parties. We have told them that we would support the party which reduces GST for small units,‚Äô‚Äô says K Maniraj, president of Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association.The DMK and Kamal Haasan ‚Äôs Makkal Needhi Maiam have promised to generate lakhs of jobs, while the AIADMK has promised dole for the unemployed. The DMK has also said it would get the Centre to enrol youth, who have studied up to Class X as road maintenance workers. ""The Centre should also employ 50 lakh women as people‚Äôs welfare workers in the country,"" Stalin said at a public meeting. Prime Minister Modi, whose Make in India campaign had promised empowerment of small-scale industries , was careful to address these concerns at the public meeting in Coimbatore on Tuesday. He underscored the measures taken by the government to address the woes of the small and micro units that were still reeling under the impact of GST and demonestisation. He said the defence corridor proposed for TN would bring jobs to the state.But while promises come easy, people are reeling under a job crisis. According to the Annual Employment Unemployment Survey 2015-16, released recently, the educated unemployment rate in Tamil Nadu stood at 6.2%, higher than neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka. Labour economist and Madras Institute of Development Studies professor M Vijayabaskar said, ""People are entering the job market in droves, but job creation has not kept pace with this entry."" Besides a slowdown in industrial investment and expansion, GST and demonetisation have had a huge impact on the job market, he said. ""The focus should be on investments that would generate jobs,"" he said.Experts also point out that it was not just a case of unemployment, but more of underemployment. People do manage to find jobs to eke out a living, but a job that does not match their educational qualification or skill set. This was apparent when the Tamil Nadu assembly wanted to recruit sanitary workers recently, it received more than 4,600 applications for the 14 posts to be filled. Several of those who applied were engineers, graduates and postgraduates. There are hundreds of others ‚Äî zipping around on two-wheelers delivering food for online food delivery aggregators, to make ends meet.Labour market analysts and industrialists say unemployment would have a say in the elections. ""Unemployment as such may not be the sole criteria for an individual to chose a political party. But associated factors like quality of life would have a bearing on their decision making,"" said a market analyst.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/distress-of-job-crisis-casts-a-shadowon-the-skilled/articleshow/68802610.cms,

We are now facing a global jobs crisis. Many governments are aware and acting, but more decisive and coordinated international action is needed to avert a global social recession,"" ILO Director-General Juan Somavia said in a statement from Geneva.The latest report said that based on November 2008 IMF forecasts, the global unemployment rate would rise to 6.1% in 2009 compared to 5.7% in 2007, resulting in an increase of the number of unemployed by 18 million people in 2009 in comparison with 2007.If the economic outlook deteriorates beyond what was envisaged in November 2008, ""which is likely"", the global unemployment rate could rise to 6.5%, corresponding to an increase of the global number of unemployed by 30 million people in comparison with 2007, it said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Economic-crisis-to-trigger-more-unemployment-ILO/articleshow/4043374.cms,

"Just some clever lines? India faces a scary jobs crisis, reality is belied by Centre‚Äôs claims on employment","In 2014, BJP came to power promising 10 million new jobs a year. In 2019, it will be tested against this promise and the degree to which it has fulfilled it. With the median age of the Indian population at 28 years old, it is the jobs issue that will define the nature of the mandate in 2019. How successful has the Modi government been on the jobs front?

The government claims it has done a lot. So let us examine its claims ‚Äì its fake news, in my opinion ‚Äì and test these against facts. The NDA government quotes reports by business associations and consultancies to emphasise that 14 million jobs have been created between 2014 and 2017 in four key sectors ‚Äì IT-BPM, retail, textiles and automobiles. A BJP spokesperson has also asserted that the travel and tourism sector is growing at 16% annually and adding three to four million jobs each year.

I decided to dig deeper, startled by these claims. I discovered the government‚Äôs claims to be completely bogus. For a start, out of the 14 million jobs ‚Äúcreated‚Äù, the number for two out of the four key industries is actually a projection made by the National Skill Development Corporation in 2015. A projection ‚Äì a prediction, a speculative number; not reality and not backed by any evidence of actually having happened.

What about tourism? Foreign tourist arrivals are growing at 16% a year, but tourism as an industry is growing at 7%. These numbers are not the same. And as per the World Travel and Tourism Council, the number of jobs directly created by the tourism sector in 2017 was half a million ‚Äì not three to four million, as insisted upon by ministers.

Fake news has been matched by fake interpretation of numbers. Both the prime minister and finance minister have cited increased Employee Provident Fund (EPF) registrations as evidence of job creation. They have argued that seven million jobs were created in the organised sector in 2017-18. This is a seriously slippery contention. Does the creation of an EPF account mean the creation of a job?

The fact is that after demonetisation and GST, there has been large-scale formalisation in our job markets. This has led to the creation of EPF accounts by those who are now being paid by direct debit or by cheque but were earlier paid in cash. This is not the same as job creation.

And of course one cannot and must not conclude that GST and demonetisation had only positive consequences. Both came at the cost of huge job losses, particularly in the unorganised sector and, in the case of the flawed GST rollout, in manufacturing and services as well.

These two macroeconomic shocks that disrupted our economy for the worse have been the focal point of any debate on the economy for a long time now. At the same time, we have not seen any long-sighted policy response to unemployment from the Centre. The ministry of labour and employment has said that there had been no targets fixed by the government to create jobs in the previous or current financial year. What was that ‚Äú10 million jobs a year‚Äù promise then ‚Äì a specific target or just a clever line?

The government and BJP have often harped on the need for entrepreneurship. Much has been made of the Mudra scheme and its role in creating self-employment and job opportunities. They have pointed to how new entrepreneurs have taken loans and then hired at least one person for new enterprises. Is this correct?

In theory it sounds believable. In practice, the average Mudra loan is Rs 44,000 (2016-17). Many such loans have gone to entrepreneurs who already had a small business and were looking for extra, top-up capital. An incremental loan of Rs 44,000 is hardly enough to create jobs and make the Mudra loan takers big employers. But tell that to the government.

Beyond these fantasy numbers, the job situation is truly scary. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), in February 2018, 31 million people in India were seeking jobs but not finding them. This is the highest such number since October 2016. In Parliament, the ministry was asked about the job situation. In response to the question, the minister cited a recent International Labour Organisation report. And told us that the number of unemployed persons is expected to rise from 18.3 million in 2017 to 18.6 million in 2018 to 18.9 million in 2019!

Far from improving, the job crisis has worsened in the four years of Modi raj. Earlier this year, 18 posts for peons in the Rajasthan state secretariat in Jaipur were advertised. There were 12,453 applicants, including 129 engineers. In the time of Start-Up India and Make in India, even engineers are so desperate for employment that they are ready to serve as peons.

The tragedy is there are clear vacancies in the government and government institutions themselves. But the BJP-led government has not shown the capacity and resolve to fill these vacancies. As a result, 50% of posts in central universities are unfilled; one of three faculty positions in IITs is unfilled; 20% of sanctioned posts for IPS officers are unfilled; one of eight pilot positions in the Air Force is unfilled ‚Ä¶

What could be a greater indictment of the BJP years?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-edit-page/just-some-clever-lines-india-faces-a-scary-jobs-crisis-reality-is-belied-by-centres-claims-on-employment/,

NEW DELHI: In his first meeting with the chief ministers after re-election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday called for a collective fight against poverty, unemployment, corruption, and violence and for urgent steps to tackle drought and drinking water crisis in the country.""Empowerment and ease of living have to be provided to each and every Indian,"" he said while addressing the 5th meeting of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog at Rashtrapati Bhawan Cultural Centre in the national capital.Modi said goals set for the 150th anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi should be accomplished by October 2 and work should begin in earnest towards the goals for 2022, the 75th anniversary of Independence. The focus should be on collective responsibility for achieving short term and long-term goals.Modi said the goal of making India a five trillion dollar economy by 2024 is challenging but achievable. The states should recognise their core competence and work towards raising GDP targets right from the district level.""Both the Centre and the States should work towards growth in exports in order to raise per capita income. A thrust on export promotion at the state level will provide a boost to both income and employment,"" said the Prime Minister.Describing water as an important element for life, Modi said the poor bear the brunt of insufficient water conservation efforts. He called for effective steps to tackle drought and said that the spirit of per-drop, more-crop needs to be promoted.The newly-created jal shakti ministry will help provide an integrated approach to water. He urged states to integrate their efforts towards water conservation and management. Management of available water resources is a vital imperative, said the Prime Minister.Reiterating his government's commitment to double the income of farmers by 2022, Modi said that this requires to focus on fisheries, animal husbandry, horticulture, fruits, and vegetables.There is a need for structural reform in agriculture which require corporate investments, robust logistics, and ample market support. He said the food processing sector should grow at a faster pace than foodgrain production.The Prime Minister said the battle against Naxal violence is now in a decisive phase. Violence will be dealt with firmly even as development proceeds in a fast-paced and balanced manner, he said.On the health sector, Modi said that several targets have to be achieved by 2022. He also mentioned the target of eliminating tuberculosis by 2025. The Prime Minister urged those states who have not implemented Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) under the Ayushman Bharat so far to come onboard this scheme at the earliest.Health and wellness should be the focal point of every decision, he added.Modi said the country is moving towards a governance system characterised by performance, transparency, and delivery for which proper implementation of schemes and decisions is vital.He called upon all members of the Governing Council of NITI Aayog to help create a government setup which works and has the trust of the people.The Prime Minister said NITI Aayog has a key role to play in fulfilling the mantra of 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas.'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pm-modi-calls-for-collective-fight-against-poverty-unemployment-water-crisis/articleshow/69803287.cms,
Unemployability a big crisis: Report,"This story is from November 16, 2007

NEW DELHI: As the country launches itself on a higher growth trajectory but with rising unemployment, a report says that unemployability is a bigger crisis than unemployment.

""53 per cent of employed youth suffer some degree of skill deprivation while only 8 per cent of youth are unemployed,"" says India Labour Report 2007.

The report prepared by one of India's largest staffing company, TeamLease Services, adds, ""57 per cent of India's youth suffer some degree of unemployability.""

It adds that India has joined the big league of a trillion-dollar economy, despite a high level of unemployment and illiteracy.

Noting that the present education system needs to be improved, the report says, ""90 per cent of employment opportunities require vocational skills but 90 per cent of our college/school output has bookish knowledge.""

The report also points out that 300 million youth will enter the labour force by 2025 and 25 per cent of the world's workers in the next four years will be Indians.

""The skill deficit hurts more than the infrastructure deficit because it sabotages equality of opportunity and amplifies inequality while poor infrastructure maintains inequality (it hits rich and poor equally),"" it adds.

""The unfinished education and training reform agenda denies our youth the economic equivalent of a right to vote. It perpetuates inequality of opportunity because unemployability is now a bigger problem than unemployment,"" says Manish Sabharwal, Chairman, TeamLease Services.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Unemployability-a-big-crisis-Report/articleshow/2545880.cms,

UNITED NATIONS: Unemployment in India is projected to witness marginal increase between 2017 and 2018, signalling stagnation in job creation in the country, according to a UN labour report.The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) released its 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report yesterday, which finds economic growth trends lagging behind employment needs and predicts both rising unemployment and worsening social inequality throughout 2017.Job creation in India is not expected to pick up pace in 2017 and 2018 as unemployment rises slightly, representing a near stagnation in percentage terms.""Unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7 million last year to 17.8 million in 2017 and 18 million next year. In percentage terms, unemployment rate will remain at 3.4 per cent in 2017-18,"" the report added.India had performed slightly well in terms of job creation in 2016, when a ""majority"" of the 13.4 million new employment created in Southern Asia happened in the country.The report also acknowledged that India's 7.6 per cent growth in 2016 helped Southern Asia achieve 6.8 per cent growth that year.""Manufacturing growth has underpinned India's recent economic performance, which may help buffer demand for the region's commodity exporters,"" it added.The report added that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent (from 5.7 per cent in 2016) - representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017).""We are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labour market entrants every year,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.The increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries - as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017.The number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 (during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016), it said.""Almost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,"" said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.That statistic is even worse for emerging countries. Those living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing the greatest risk.In contrast, unemployment is expected to fall in 2017 in developed countries (by 670,000), bringing the rate down to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2016.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unemployment-in-india-to-increase-marginally-in-2017-18-un-report/articleshow/56512962.cms,

While the economy is growing at just over 7% per year, jobs increased by just 1.1% last year, according to a recently-released report covering eight key sectors of the non-farm economy. An earlier report had pegged joblessness at a fiveyear high of 5% in 2015, and under-employment at a staggering 35% of the over-15 years labour force.Seen in this context, the government is facing a growing employment crisis which its various initiatives are unable to address.Both reports are based on large surveys carried out by the Labour Bureau. Job growth is tracked by a revamped quarterly survey of over 10,000 units while unemployment is recorded in an annual survey of 7.8 lakh people. The new quarterly survey started in April 2016 and replaced an earlier one which covered certain export-oriented sectors. Providing decent jobs was one of the most popular promises which swept the Modi-led BJP to office in 2014 and helped it win several state elections.Most recently, Yogi Adityanath too had promised to address the jobs situation in UP after being anointed the chief minister following BJP‚Äôs dramatic victory in the state assembly elections. UP itself has an estimated 1 crore unemployed, according to the report.Recent reports of several IT and BPO majors shedding jobs have added to the worries of people, especially urban middle-class families which had been riding the IT boom. Global slowdown in IT services and components and new visa restrictions are thought to be behind this.Several other indicators explain this painful situation. Gross credit given to industry has grown by just 6.7% in the past three years, the index of industrial production has inched up by just 6% and growth in gross fixed capital formation slipped to an alarmingly low 0.6% in January this year compared to 6.1% last year. A total of 2.3 lakh jobs were added to the eight sectors covered in the quarterly survey including manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, accommodation and restaurants, IT/BPO, education and health.Nearly half of the new jobs added were in education and health. Both these sectors are known for low paying jobs. Construction and the hospitality/food sectors showed loss of jobs, the most serious ones, amounting to a dip of nearly 7%, is in construction.One usually neglected aspect of India‚Äôs unemployment crisis is of under-employment or concealed unemployment. This is of two types ‚Äînot finding work for full year and work at very low wages. The Labour Bureau‚Äôs 2016 report on unemployment paints a dire picture of both fronts.Only 61% of people in the workforce were found to have year-round jobs with 34% working only 6-11 months even though they were willing to work for 12 months. The report also revealed that 68% households were earning only Rs 10,000 per month or less. In all, nearly 16 crore people in the workforce were under-employed in this manner.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/economy-growing-at-7-jobs-at-1/articleshow/58742227.cms,

NEW DELHI: More than 20 per cent of Indians in the 15-24 age group were jobless and seeking work, according to startling data released on Tuesday by Census 2011 In absolute terms, this army of unemployed youth is staggeringly huge ‚Äî around 4.7 crore of which 2.6 crore were men and 2.1 crore women.These definitive figures for 2011 reveal the deep and pervasive unemployment that has gripped India since the past decade even as economic growth was zooming along at over 8 per cent per annum for most of this period.The figures include the entirely unemployed and marginal workers who get work only for up to six months in a year.Overall, the unemployment rate among the working age population in the 15-59 age group was a worrisome 14.5 per cent, including marginal workers seeking work.In the 25-29 age group, the unemployment rate was nearly 18 per cent. Even among those in the 30-34 age group, nearly 6 per cent were unemployed, numbering over 1.2 crore.Among dalits, unemployment rate in the working age population of 15-59 years was a shocking 18 per cent, much higher than the general population. Among adivasis, the unemployment rate was even higher at over 19 per cent. These are the two most marginalized sections of Indian society and clearly they are struggling with widespread unemployment.Inexplicably, census authorities have not released data for 15-19 years and other such five-year age groups for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, like it has been done for the general population. In the 15-34 age group, 21 per cent dalits and 22 per cent adivasis were reported to be unemployed. This includes the ‚Äòyouth‚Äô age group of 15-24 years but in later years, more persons should be finding employment.One myth busted by this age-wise data on workers and non-workers is that young women do not want to work either because of family responsibilities or social disapproval. While the bulk of non-workers are indeed women, among younger women 20 to 29 years of age, the share of those seeking work is the same as for men in the same age group ‚Äî slightly over 20 per cent. This is the new generation that is relatively better educated and wants to build a better life, but the opportunities are not there.This finding is in consonance with the fact that women are getting married at a later age, and having children at an even later age than before.In urban areas, nearly 18 per cent of the 15-24 age group is seeking work while in rural areas the share rises to over 21 per cent. In both rural and urban areas, the share of young women seeking work is high at 17 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. So, young women wanting to work is no longer just an urban phenomenon.The new census data also shows how the lack of social security for senior citizens and low economic status is forcing them to continue working despite their advanced age. Nearly 3.3 crore persons of 60 years age or more are employed as main workers, that is, full-time regular employment. Besides these, another one crore senior citizens work as marginal workers. The bulk of elderly workers are male.Some 18.5 lakh persons of age over 80 years are still working as regular workers and another 6.5 lakh octogenarians eke out a living as ill-paid marginal workers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Over-20-of-young-Indians-are-jobless/articleshow/37598409.cms,

NEW DELHI: Unemployment rate in the country as per a new survey was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the government informed Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Minister of State for Labour Santosh Gangwar said the government is conducting a new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with new parameters and bigger sample size, and its results cannot be compared with previous surveys in this regard.""As per the new Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by the government, the labour force participation is 36.9 per cent and the rate of unemployment for 2017-18 is 6.1 per cent,"" he said.Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour , the minister said the report of this survey is very different than the surveys conducted in previous years.This survey is not comparable to previous surveys, he said, adding it was an attempt to provide authentic data with the new survey conducted through the Ministry of Statistics.""We are focusing on infrastructure development and ease of doing business and India's position in the world has improved. India has improved its position to 63rd rank now in 2019 against 196 in previous years,"" he said.""Our government is very conscious of creating employment opportunities and is running such programmes which generate employment.""The way our government is functioning, employment opportunities are being created and the youths are getting jobs also,"" the minister said.Gangwar said the government has stopped the previous survey as the sample size was low and an attempt is being made to improve the data by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/unemployment-rate-at-6-1-in-2017-18-govt-cites-new-survey-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/73960657.cms,
Measures needed to tackle unemployment in India,"The latest report of Mumbai based think tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) released on March 02, 2020, reveals that unemployment rate in India (the third-largest economy of Asia) has increased to 7.78 per cent in February from 7.16 per cent in January of 2020. The jobless rate in urban areas was recorded at 8.65 while in rural areas at 7.37 per cent. It reflects the impact of the slowdown in the Indian economy sadly not confessed by the politicians in power.

There is a big discrepancy in unemployment rates by states: the rates above 20 per cent were reported in the states of Tripura ( 28.4, Haryana (25.8) and Jammu & Kashmir (22.2) while jobless rates in Puducherry (1.8), Meghalaya and Tamil Nadu (2.1), Goa (2.8) were below 3 per cent.

The official data shows that the unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in India during FY 2018 highlighting the challenge that confronts the government. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) released on June 01, 2019, showed the unemployment rate in the country in FY2018 was at 5.3% in rural India and 7.8% in urban India, resulting in the overall unemployment rate of 6.1%. It is believed that no data collection methodology for measuring unemployment is perfect and 100 per cent reliable.

The data on employment in the organized sector is more reliable than that in the unorganized sector (accounting for some 90 per cent of total employment in India). But that has been the case all the time. So, just because the data are turning out to be unpalatable for a government, its suppression (that is, of NSSO data) is a dangerous trend which destroys the credibility of official statistics and a data collection agency whose reputation has been built over many decades.

A big controversy has erupted over job creation under the Modi regime ‚Äîin particular, over whether the unemployment rate in 2017-18 is, in fact, the highest in four decades as CMIE data, as well as the officially undisclosed but reported in the press NSSO data, seem to indicate

we need to understand, analyze and interpret the linkages between economic growth and employment creation.

The hollow claims of the employment generation by the Government of India has been belied by the data.

What about the demographic dividend being claimed, India has 62.5% of its population in the age group of 15-59 years which is ever increasing and will be at the peak around 2036 when it will reach approximately 65%.

These population parameters indicate the availability of demographic dividend in India, which started in 2005-06 and will last till 2055-. The actual realization of the demographic dividend cannot be thought of without a concrete plan of action.

It has been sadly observed that increasing inequalities in opportunities for employment and income. The widening wage gap between the unskilled and skilled labour force at a faster rate than before has been observed in India.

By believing in the phrase, ‚ÄòJai Jawan Jai Kisan‚Äô, we need to face the challenges caused by internal threats and terrorism of various kinds including unemployment, underemployment and suicides by farmers. One practical solution of these problems is to make military services compulsory (as in South Korea) for the youth with the status of HRD activity which will bring discipline to the Indian economy in one sense or the other. We need to bring more land under cultivation for which we may think of nationalization of agriculture by acquiring land as advocated by Dr BR Ambedkar. We can hand over such land to the Army to develop military farms which possess the potential to do wonders in terms of bringing discipline on the one hand and more barren land under cultivation.

There is a case for rural industrialization for reducing underemployment and disguised unemployment in India. It means not village industries but industries having backwards and forward linkages with agriculture.

To achieve the objective of self-employment by inter alia organizing the youth into Self Help Groups (SHG) through a process of social mobilization, their training and capacity building and provision of income-generating assets through a mix of bank credit and government subsidy.

This approach of credit is known as microfinance for self-employment. Credit is one of the most crucial inputs in the process of development for creating employment opportunities. Microfinance is expected to play a significant role in giving natural death to the twin sister problems of poverty and unemployment. In the recent past, it has become one of the most promising ways to use scarce development funds to achieve the objective of poverty alleviation and self-employment. Microfinance is a term for the practice of providing financial services such as microcredit, micro-savings and micro-insurance to the poor and unemployed youth. There are several micro-finance implementing organizations in India which provide small loans to rural people. Some of them have successfully extended their services to thousands of borrowers. For many, it is difficult to have access to financial services through the formal sector because of the cumbersome procedure.

The process of micro-finance starts with the formation of the self-help group which is a group of youth who have volunteered themselves into a group of about 10-20 people from a homogeneous class for addressing their common financial problems. The individual approach to microfinance self-employment activities could not yield the expected results due to the relatively high transactional costs and procedural delays involved in it. However, it was observed from experiences that delivery of micro-credit is more effective and less costly in the organized form of self-help groups. This approach can help the rural unemployed youth.

We need to create the equality of opportunity coming from education, skills and jobs for men and women who needs to modify their mental makeup in the present era of competition both healthy as well as unhealthy at all levels.

For solving the twin problems poverty and unemployment, India can fit into the framework of WTO by converting Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) into a Multi-National Corporation (MNC) and possess the potential to do wonders. Mahatma Gandhi talked of Khadi for more than clothing -a way of life in a swadeshi strategy of survival, subsistence and self-sufficiency (an objective of a closed economy where there is no international trade) best suited to the needs of that time. But if he is alive today and sees the present times of post-reform era he would have certainly talked of Khadi for self-reliance, the present objective of Indian economy with international trade and of course, Indian economy including Khadi have to be internationalized at all costs for fetching the fortunes under the mantra of Globalization.

To my mind, Indians are unemployed and are poor in India only. I do not know any Indian outside India to be poor or unemployed. We have proved our worth where ever we got opportunities in the World. Brian drain is no more a problem rather an opportunity.

We need to emphasize the trade in services through the movement of service providers under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the WTO. International migration has generated enormous remittances and India emerged as a top remittance-receiving country in the World with $82.2 billion in 2019 assisting and supporting macro-level economic activities and micro-level support to the recipient families in particular and the migration pockets in general.

To sum up, we need to use Self Help Group (SHG) strategy in a big way for creating self-employment opportunities instead of wage employment opportunities for the unemployed youth who otherwise is a demographic dividend of the nation. The idea of compulsory military service is also worth considering. We can solve the problem of unemployment by exporting manpower to other countries of the World under the GATS of WTO. There is a case for KVIC to be converted into an MNC also. The measures for employment opportunities of women In India are to be stepped up with political will and determination. We have to be aware, alert, awake for the challenges in entrepreneurship and remain enthusiastic with all precautions including GST and cyber laws. Entrepreneurship can be people friendly and socially beneficial only if undertaken in accordance with NAW (Need, Affordability and Worth) approach for the marketing of goods and services. To be motivated for self-employment, we have to adopt entrepreneurship in services more than manufacturing with ample opportunities including empowerment of consumers with a competitive advantage, convenient, fewer hassles, quick adjustment to market conditions and low-cost cloud shops. For becoming job giver instead of job seeker, we have to adopt entrepreneurship in tourism sector capable of doing wonders with highest employment multiplier.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/readersblog/issues-in-indian-economic-policy/measures-needed-to-tackle-unemployment-in-india-10372/,

The interview that went on for 40 days had many applicants who were postgraduates and professional degree holders, including BEs and MBAs, for the job offering a monthly salary of Rs 15,000.Two months later, the Coimbatore corporation received nearly 7,000 applications to fill the 549 grade-I sanitary workers‚Äô posts that guaranteed a monthly salary of Rs 20,000.The two episodes indicate a dearth of proper employment opportunities and job security in the state that were forcing highly qualified youngsters to compete for the post of sanitary workers and peons in the government sector.Though the Edappadi K Palaniswami government has been taking efforts to attract foreign investment and is working on an effective single window system for ease of doing business, the results will take time to fructify.Deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam, while presenting the 2019-2020 budget, admitted the government was facing a ""daunting task"" to improve the economic growth of the state to create more jobs and reduce poverty. The government, accordingly, is focusing primarily to woo greater investments in the manufacturing and service sectors.The CM and his cabinet colleagues toured the UK, the USA and the Middle East a few months ago and signed 41 MoUs, attracting investment to the tune of Rs8,835 crore. Ahead of the trip, the EPS government held the second edition of Global Investors Meet and signed 304 MoUs to attract investment of little more than Rs3 lakh crore that is expected to generate around 10 lakh jobs in the next few years.Though experts and industrialists welcome the government‚Äôs efforts to attract foreign investments with an eye on generating employment for the youth in the state, they also feel it will take a few years to turn it into reality.A day ahead of the state Budget, industrialists and experts opined the government should invest more in micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as in the agriculture sector. It will arrest migration of labour from rural to urban areas. Entrepreneurs said the government should extend financial support to small and micro enterprises and create facilities to train and supply skilled workforce for the sector. ""We have been requesting the government to come up with policies to support and encourage MSMEs for the past three years, but nothing has happened. We hope our pleas will be considered this year,"" said M Swaminathan of the Federation of Association of Small Industries of India.According to the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) in 2017-2018, which was published recently by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation, Tamil Nadu has the highest rate of unemployment among the developed states in the country. Unemployment stood at 7.6%, as against the national unemployment rate of 6.1%. The neighbouring Andhra Pradesh (4.5%), Karnataka (4.8%), and Maharashtra (4.9%) and West Bengal (4.6%) are placed better than TN on this front.Being a predominantly service sector driven economy, which contributes to 51.86% of gross state domestic product (GSDP), the national and international economic slowdown has its direct impact on the industrial climate in the state, according to K R Shanmugam, director of Madras School of Economics.""The government should come up with a policy to enhance the minimum wages from Rs18,000 to Rs35,000 and guarantee job security for the workforce in private firms,"" said S Kannan, state acting general secretary of CITU. CII‚Äôs Tamil Nadu state council chairman S Chandramohan said speeding up of the Chennai-Kanyakumari industrial corridor, which is a comprehensive development plan, will enable the state grow faster.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-tops-in-unemployment-rate-may-need-course-correction/articleshow/74124881.cms,

When jobs are scarce, being employed is a blessing. But how many employed Indians have a job that the International Labour Organisation (ILO) defines as ‚Äòdecent‚Äô? In a global comparison of such jobs, India shows up very poorly. One of the constituents of decent employment is percentage of wage and salaried workers in the total workforce. India‚Äôs percentage is lower than even its less developed neighbours. This is the fallout of having a large informal sector and still-very-rigid labour laws.Compared with many other countries, India‚Äôs share of wage and salaried workers in the overall workforce has been abysmal. While there has been a modest improvement, especially after 2010, it pales next to China‚Äôs, where the share of formal sector employment has crossed 50%.An explanation for low share of decent employment is the income-employment skew among three sectors of the economy ‚Äî large and fast-growing sectors (services) are not creating enough jobs for people stuck in the small and shrinking agriculture sector.ILO defines decent jobs as those that ensure dignity, equality, fair income and job safety. Wage and salaried employment is one of the indicators of decent employment. Workers should hold employment contracts with basic remuneration that is not dependent upon the revenue of the unit for which they work.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-bad-employment-is-a-bigger-problem-than-unemployment/articleshow/70099901.cms,

Thiruvananthapuram: The state labour department will carry out a survey to identify the actual number of unemployed people in Kerala from those registered in employment exchanges.The survey will be piloted in Thiruvananthapuram district, which has the maximum number of unemployed people registered in the employment exchange, said an official release. The government has issued order for implementing the project under the research scheme of the Kerala Institute of Labour and Employment (KILE) functioning under the department, the release said.The recent statistics based on employment exchange data had shown that the unemployment rate in Kerala was much higher than the national average. Citing the national statistics, labour minister T P Ramakrishnan had revealed in the assembly that it was 9.53% against the national average of 6.1%.As per the latest figures, there are 36,25,852 unemployed youths in the state, out of which 7,303 are medical graduates and 44,559 are engineering graduates. There are 6,413 MBA graduates and 3,771 MCA graduates who remain jobless.The number of unemployed women is almost double that of their counterpart (23,00,139 against 13,25,713), and there are 12,006 nursing graduates who are jobless in the state. The unemployed also included 1,43,453 people holding other professional degrees, 3,31,192 degree holders and 94,590 post graduate degree holders. Sikkim (18.1%) and Tripura (19.7%) are the only two states which are above Kerala in the unemployment rate.Now, the survey is being launched as a reality check on these figures, which could be inaccurate as many people who are registered in employment exchanges now work in private firms if not in the government sector.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/thiruvananthapuram/survey-to-identify-the-real-unemployed/articleshow/72313314.cms,

BENGALURU: Unemployment and poverty pushed at least 10 Indians ‚Äî nine men and one woman on average ‚Äî to kill themselves every day in 2018, while another 20 of them killed themselves daily because of addiction to drugs and alcohol.The information was accessed from the latest data on suicides released by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) on Friday (January 3). Overall, India saw 1.34 lakh suicides in 2018, registering a 3.6% increase from the 1.3 lakh such cases in 2017. Comparatively, suicide because of joblessness grew by 14%, while deaths because of family problem ‚Äî which accounts for 30.4% of all suicides ‚Äî reported an increase of 4.8%.After family problems, illness, accounting for 18% of all deaths stood second, followed by marital problems, which accounted for 6.2%. Deaths due to these two causes also grew by 14% compared to 2017.Between 2014 and 2018, India lost a total of 45,743 people to these three causes ‚Äî joblessness, poverty and addiction, of whom 12,373 and 6,957 committed suicide because of joblessness and poverty, respectively.In 2018, more than 2,700 people in India committed suicide because of unemployment, at the rate of seven every day, which is, on average, one more suicide per day compared to 2017, which saw more than 2,400 such cases. Similarly, poverty pushed three people to death each day in 2018 with a total of 1,202 deaths, a slight increase from the 1,198 deaths in 2017.‚ÄúIf this data is not critical motivated, it triggers an idea that I've been mooting for a while. This country needs MSME universities. We must move ahead from the 1960s and 1970s idea of education,‚Äù Prof Charan Singh, former senior economist at IMF and now CEO of EGROW Foundation said.He added that this will do two things: One, create employment and two, remove people from poverty.Of the people who killed themselves because they didn‚Äôt find a job, 20% were aged between 18 and 45 years, while another 10% were between 45 and 60 years of age. About 11% of these were women.Among those who committed suicide because of poverty, a majority of them (469) were in the age group of 30-45 years and women accounted for 15%.Bengaluru-based psychiatrist Jagadish A, says: ""Joblessness affects both the white collar and blue collar workers. If things like children's education, home and vehicle loans haunt the white collar workers losing jobs, the complete inability to take care of the family affects the poor.""Aside from this, drugs and alcohol claimed nearly 20 lives a day with 7,193 suicides ‚Äî more than 1,900 of whom were aged between 45 and 60 years ‚Äî including 306 women.Of the more than 7,000 deaths because of addiction, 1,908 of the total deaths were aged between 45 and 60 years, while 1,774 were between 18 and 30 years.""Alcohol and drugs combined with depression can lead to suicidal tendencies. We see this commonly among patients. Alcohol is a double-edged sword, if you are happy and toasting champagne, it can lift your mood, if you binge because you are depressed, it can push you to suicide,"" Jagadish said.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/every-day-10-kill-themselves-due-to-joblessness-poverty-in-india/articleshow/73190365.cms,

NEW DELHI: Only 2.1% of illiterate urban men were unemployed in 2017-18, but 9.2% of men with at least secondary education didn‚Äôt have a job. The gap was even wider among urban women ‚Äî 0.8% of those uneducated were jobless whereas 20% women with secondary or higher education were not employed.The(PLFS) released by the National Statistic Office (NSO) on Friday shows the unemployment rate (% of labour force without a job) rising by up to 4 times between urban women who have only middle-school education and those educated up to secondary-school or more. Unemployment in rural areas shows a similar pattern, though the degree of skewness is less.Thedidn‚Äôt rise only with education level, it has also risen over time. The NSO‚Äôs Friday release also provides unemployment data for 2004-5, 2009-10 and 2011-12, adding a caution that past data shouldn‚Äôt be compared with 2017-18 figures because of several methodological changes introduced in the latest round of the survey.Even if exact figures are not to be compared across the four years, the broad trend across time is of rise in joblessness with level of education.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a surprise, we have known of the rising phenomenon of educated unemployment for some time. It‚Äôs just an official confirmation,‚Äù said Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India.Mahesh Vyas, CEO of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, says: ‚ÄúA generation ago it was inconceivable to get a job in the organised sectors without a graduation degree.

The study among the educated is restricted to persons of the age of 15 years and above. Some experts believe 15 may be too young an age to check for employment status, especially in urban areas. ""It is possible that the unemployment rate should be higher in younger age brackets as a typical educated urban youth may not even start working before 23 to 24 years ‚Äî until he or she completes post-graduation,‚Äù says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at State Bank of India .

They demanded employment for the youths and properly implement the skill development programmes to make the educated youths employable.Odisha BJP Yuva Morcha president Tankadhar Tripathy alleged that the BJD government has failed to provide jobs to the youths of the state. ‚ÄúAround 22.57 lakh youths have registered their names in the state‚Äôs employment exchange since 2009, but around 26,450 of them have received employment which is only one per cent.

India needs to create millions of jobs annually: Book,"This story is from April 26, 2019

""Jobonomics: India's Employment Crisis and What the Future Holds"" by Goutam Das goes beyond the data or the lack of it to analyse the story of India's job and income scenario through real life stories.

It shifts the discussion from the Centre's role in job creation to the states' responsibilities and provides insight on how they need to go about it.

According to the author, job creation remains Prime Minister Narendra Modi's biggest challenge.

""For that matter, it is the biggest challenge for any government in 2019 and beyond,"" he says.

Das is of the view that it is difficult to come across reliable data about jobs and job creation.

""Most of the government surveys either have design flaws or are released once in many years. One audacious private effort by the CMIE at tabulating unemployment - a household survey to measure unemployment that it started in 2016 - isn't quite liked by many in the government,"" he writes in the book, published by Hachette.

""The numbers aren't encouraging. The employment needle, according to the CMIE, hasn't moved in the past year. The number of people employed in 2017-18 was 406.2 million, 0.1 per cent lower than the year before. The employment rate, or the proportion of working age population that is employed, slid in 2017-18 to 41.45 per cent compared to 42.59 per cent the year before,"" he goes on to add.

He terms the government's unemployment estimates as more conservative, but feels its ""surveys are not really comparable to those of the CMIE, whose computations are based on the status of the respondents as on the day of the survey or as on the preceding day"".

He says an unemployment rate of 5 per cent or slightly lower appears manageable right now.

""It does not indicate a job crisis. But consider this: more than a million young people enter the working age population in India every month. The World Bank's South Asia Economic Focus Spring 2018 report states that between 2015 and 2025, India's working age population, or those above the age of 15, is seen to be expanding by 1.3 million a month.

""India, therefore, needs to create millions of jobs a year - exactly how many millions depends on the estimates of the employment rate,"" he suggests.

Manufacturing, according to the book, is getting more technology intensive and so is the services industry.

""The ability of these two sectors to absorb people migrating from the unproductive and less remunerative farm sector is on the decline. Robots and bots are also decimating the higher-paying white-collar jobs. Technological disruptions imply that jobs of the future would need people with higher technical skills,"" it says.

The book also seeks to connect the dots on what's coming and why the economy's ability to absorb so many into the workforce every year is a slippery slope.

The first section of the book is about why the demand for jobs could shrink in the future, and how it could accelerate the pay crisis.

The second section narrates the problems with the supply side of India's human capital and the conversations around poor primary and vocational education, health and attitudes. It also explores the implications that the shrinking demand for jobs and our poorly prepared human capital will have on the country.

"Young and restless: Urban India is not a jobs dynamo, this can sap the potential benefits of demographic transition","The age structure of a society has far-reaching impact on its economic trajectory. India is in the midst of a phase where the economy can benefit on account of a demographic dividend, a surge in economic growth that has its roots in decline of both fertility and mortality rates. This is when the proportion of working age people increases. The Indian experience, so far, has been disappointing. Population in the 0-19 age bracket has already peaked. However, available data suggests that we are facing an employment crisis, particularly among recent entrants to the working age population.

CMIE‚Äôs quarterly update on the job market shows that the October-December period was the worst since 2016. Unemployment stood at 7.85%, the highest level in over three years. While these numbers are worrisome, what should alarm policy makers is the trend in urban employment. Cities are the locomotive of India‚Äôs growth. They should ideally provide options for young job seekers from rural India. Such movement will also have a positive impact on the agrarian economy by reducing pressure on land. But recent Indian experience suggests that urban India is simply not the jobs dynamo it should be.

The CMIE data, for instance, shows that employment ratio in urban India is lower than rural parts of the country. This is not a one-off, but something observed for a while. This is the alarming aspect of available jobs data. Economic growth may have slowed but the bottom line is that the economy is still expanding. However, that is not translating into adequate jobs. In this scenario, India runs the risk of watching a potential demographic dividend turn into a nightmare. Preventing this requires more and better data. This needs to be supplemented with more targeted interventions to enhance employability of young job seekers.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/young-and-restless-urban-india-is-not-a-jobs-dynamo-this-can-sap-the-potential-benefits-of-demographic-transition/,

NEW DELHI: Wish Town was once a sought-after destination for India‚Äôs aspiring middle classes seeking a slice of the ‚Äúgood days‚Äù promised by an ambitious Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he swept to power more than five years ago. Now, it‚Äôs a symbol of lost hope.A sprawling 1,063-acre property development located in Noida, just outside New Delhi, Wish Town was supposed to give would-be home buyers sparkling shopping malls, pristine golf courses and modern medical clinics. Apartments that should have been delivered by 2012 were billed in the media as ‚Äúglobal homes with an Indian address.‚ÄùToday the area is dotted with unfinished apartment blocks, abandoned part way through construction. Dilapidated buildings stand vacant, with overgrown bushes instead of manicured lawns. Most of the streets are empty of cars and people, aside from a few security guards.Wish Town‚Äôs failure tells the story of an economy in distress, a banking system in pain and consumers too worried about job cuts and rising costs to spend. India‚Äôs slumping consumption is so severe that it‚Äôs denting global growth and prompting economists including last year‚Äôs Nobel prize winner Abhijit Banerjee to warn of a ‚Äúmajor recession‚Äù in the country.The real estate market illustrates the extent of the economy‚Äôs woes. Property developers like Wish Town‚Äôs Jaypee Infratech Ltd have gone bust, are mired in billions of dollars of debt and unable to secure funding to complete projects as promised.Non-bank financing, a $335 billion industry that became the lifeline for millions of small businesses and consumers in recent years, has dried up. Prospective home buyers are paying mortgages for apartments they can‚Äôt live in, putting their budgets under strain. And millions of construction jobs are at risk, with effects that are already rippling across India‚Äôs all-important rural economy.From 8% growth three years ago, the economy is set to expand just 5% in the fiscal year through March, the weakest performance since 2009. The International Monetary Fund last week slashed India‚Äôs growth forecast for this year by 1.2 percentage points to 5.8%, specifically citing the nation as a reason for cutting its global growth outlook.Despite tentative signs that the worst may be over, growth isn‚Äôt set to reach its previous highs anytime soon, never mind the 9%-10% pace the economy needs to combat extreme poverty in a nation of 1.3 billion people. Modi‚Äôs goal of almost doubling the size of the economy to $5 trillion is becoming more distant and his 2014 promise that ‚Äúgood days are coming‚Äù no longer rings true.To make matters worse for Modi, he‚Äôs dealing with the biggest social upheaval since he came to power. Thousands of students and people from neighborhood groups have joined forces countrywide to protest a controversial citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims and undermines India‚Äôs secular roots. The fallout has dented Modi‚Äôs image abroad and given some investors reason to rethink the ‚ÄòIndia Rising‚Äô narrative.At the heart of the economy‚Äôs problems is a lingering credit slowdown, made worse by a crisis in the shadow banking industry nearly two years ago following the default by one of the nation‚Äôs biggest infrastructure lenders. Shadow banks ‚Äî lenders outside the regular financial system that aren‚Äôt as tightly regulated as deposit-taking banks ‚Äî had been responsible for millions of small loans on everything from cars to gold jewelry to luxury apartments over the years. The shock default caused credit markets to seize up in what some have called India‚Äôs Lehman moment, a reference to the 2008 collapse of the Wall Street investment bank that triggered the global financial crisis.As lenders choked off credit, domestic spending took a knock ‚Äî and with consumption making up almost two-thirds of India‚Äôs gross domestic product , it wasn‚Äôt too long before growth numbers were hit.In Wish Town, aspiring home buyers are curbing spending as they wait for construction to proceed.She forks out Rs 25,000 ($350) a month to rent an apartment while still paying off a mortgage of Rs 80,000 for a home in Wish Town that hasn‚Äôt been built six years after she made the purchase.‚ÄúI was expecting my first child when we bought this property. Now I have delivered another one, but the house is nowhere in sight,‚Äù Addvant said from the balcony of her rented apartment, overlooking the half-built shell that was supposed to be her new home. She‚Äôs cut back on shopping and traveling, and doesn‚Äôt plan to replace her decade-old car.A 10-minute drive from Addvant‚Äôs home in Wish Town brings you to a bustling intersection of hole-in-the-wall shops and street food carts, where about 1,000 laborers gather each morning in search of construction work that will pay less than $6 a day. Many are dressed in caps and sweaters not warm enough for New Delhi‚Äôs plummeting winter temperatures this year of as low as 3 degrees Celsius. The workers stand for hours along the sidewalk hoping to get picked up by builders who need the extra hands that day.‚ÄúEarlier, everyone would get work for about 25 days in a month, but now even five to 10 days is a lot,‚Äù said Kumar, who migrated to Bihar.To feed his two-month-old baby and already reeling from paying off loans from his relatives, Kumar has taken a job as a night security guard. He‚Äôs replaced breakfast with just a cup of tea and eats bread and salt instead of full meals. He hasn‚Äôt bought clothes in a long time, has sold his wife‚Äôs jewelry to make ends meet and looks for additional work during the day to survive.The links between the construction industry and rural incomes are strong, which explains why consumption has been so badly affected, according to Pranjul Bhandari, chief India economist at HSBC Holdings Plc in Mumbai. About two-thirds of India‚Äôs population live in rural areas and with limited incomes, many villagers flock to cities to find work and send money home to their families. Bhandari estimates 70% of rural people draw their income from activity outside of farming, especially in construction.‚ÄúRural income depends on construction, and construction depends on shadow banks by more than meets the eye,‚Äù she said.Having secured a bigger mandate in last year‚Äôs election, Modi is now confronted with rising unemployment as layoffs spread across industries from automakers to jewelers. The jobless rate ‚Äî which the most recent official data puts at a four-decade high of 6.1% in June 2018 ‚Äî probably climbed to 7.85% in the final three months of last year, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Parth Mehta, managing director at Paradigm Realty, a Mumbai-based mid-size builder, said the company is scaling back on employment as the number of projects fell.‚ÄúThe blood in the finance system has got completely choked and capital is difficult to come by,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúLack of confidence, whether among buyers, developers and in general among corporates, is one of the key reasons for the intensifying slowdown. The shadow banking crisis was the final nail in the coffin.‚ÄùThe government‚Äôs response to the slowdown so far has been focused on boosting production in the economy, rather than stimulating demand. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman gave companies $20 billion worth of tax cuts last year, set up a 250 billion-rupee fund to salvage stalled residential projects, merged weak state-run banks with stronger ones and eased foreign investment rules.She‚Äôs expected to outline more measures in her budget speech on February 1, with market watchers calling for increased spending in rural areas and tax cuts. A significant fiscal stimulus is unlikely though, given a slump in government revenue and a likely breach of this year‚Äôs deficit target of 3.3% of GDP.‚ÄúWe believe that a coordinated fiscal and monetary boost is needed to lift the economy out of its current growth slump. In our view, tax cuts aimed at spurring private consumption and a boost in public capital expenditure would increase capacity utilization, avoiding any crowding out of private-sector firms.‚Äù ‚Äî Abhishek Gupta, India economistThere‚Äôs not much scope for Shaktikanta Das, governor of the Reserve Bank of India, to keep cutting interest rates too.Inflation exceeds 7%, well above the bank‚Äôs 2%-6% target, and given the credit problems in the financial system, the RBI‚Äôs five rate cuts last year have done little to spur lending. Economists in a Bloomberg survey see 25 basis points of easing for the rest of this year.Rajesh Sharma, managing director of Capri Global Capital Ltd, a non-bank lender in Mumbai‚ÄúLending to the real estate in India is still considered a nightmare by investors because of problems including the inability of many developers to finish projects and the demand slowdown,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFunding for real estate has dried up. While it was a little difficult for the developers to get money before the shadow banking crisis, now it‚Äôs very, very difficult.‚ÄùBack in Wish Town, a state-owned company has been selected to complete construction of the outstanding apartments over the next four years. But home buyers like Manish Choudhary, a senior executive with an information technology company, remain bitter about their circumstances.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt plan vacation and buy even normal stuff. I would have sent my child to a better school if the mortgage and rent wasn‚Äôt there,‚Äù said Choudhary. ‚ÄúThe slowdown has hit the class which is paying taxes.‚Äù",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-crisis-that-shattered-indias-economic-dreams/articleshow/73761890.cms,

Unemployment at 45-year high: India living a jobs nightmare,"In the winter of 2013, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at a rally in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Modiji, those days, not only understood every problem the nation faced, he also had a solution for them. Six years and some months later, his promises have delivered little as India faces an unprecedented job crisis.

The Prime Minister, in 2013, knew that 2/3rd of the Indian population was below the age of 35 and their energy could be used in nation building. He promised to upskill the youth, create more employment opportunities so that India would emerge as a global growth powerhouse. The vision was great but six years later, India is living a jobs nightmare as unemployment is at a 45-year high.

While the situation has ballooned into a massive crisis now, it has been building up over the last few years as falling consumer demand has hit our ability to create jobs, more so for our graduates. The latest data compiled by CMIE shows that urban unemployment has now reached 9 per cent and what is worse that only two out of three job aspirants in the age group of 20-24 get a job. This is the group which completes its education and gets into the job market. Data indicates that while unemployment remains in all segments under 30 and then slips to a 2.5 per cent as people take up whatever job comes their way to put food on the table.",https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/unemployment-at-45-year-high-india-living-a-jobs-nightmare,

"Consumption and unemployment at 4-decade low, Budget 2020 is crucial for economy","Those who believe that one Budget can fix the deep mess, perhaps still believe in magic and fairy tales. They still believe that this government understands the economy and its plans would work. The reality is that this government is part of the problem, not a part of the solution.

‚ÄúIt is not a tiny command and control economy that can be bullied and directed at will. Nor can it be managed through colourful headlines and noisy media commentary,‚Äù former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had said. Headline management may help the markets but is unlikely to benefit the economy.

If the government is serious about fixing the economy, restoring consumption growth has to be the key focus area. With agriculture growing at 2 per cent and manufacturing in the negative zone, more than 70 per cent of the population is now hit by the slowdown.

The recovery process must start with agriculture and fixing rural demand before it does anything else. With almost 60 per cent of the population linked to agriculture, a 2 per cent growth rate in this segment would mean consumption will not pick up and unless that happens, all talk of revival is going to be just rhetoric. The problem, however, is that government has already played the PM Kisaan card and that too has failed to make much of an impact.

A marginal increase in PM Kisaan scheme rate would be cosmetic and serious recovery can happen only when prices go up. But that too will have limited impact as farmers get only a small part of the increased prices. Food inflation reached 14 per cent in December and has reached a point where it is hurting the poor and the working class.

Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian is among the many economists who believe that there is more pain in store for us as things are going to get worse before they get better. The question is how bad will things get and what price will the country have to pay?

The problem for the BJP is that its winning run ended with the Lok Sabha elections and Delhi is unlikely to bring much cheer. Though the CAA-NRC issues have polarised the nation but the shril discourse is unlikely to benefit them politically unless the economy picks up again.

The fact is that the government has pushed itself into a deep economic mess and its goodwill is running out at a rapid pace.

Unemployability is a bigger issue than unemployment,"According to Kris Lakshmikanth, founder chairman and MD of The Head Hunters India, the curriculum has not kept pace with the rapidly changing times and therefore vacancies can be hard to fill.

Employability will improve when the syllabus reflects the demands of the industry. A Japanese firm that set up an ancillary unit in Karnataka approached Lakshmikanth for help with hiring CNC machine operators. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt find five good candidates against the company‚Äôs requirement of 200. The skills required for the job are not taught in the five or six colleges,‚Äù he said.

The employability issue will worsen as the years go by, as many jobs will be lost to robots, he added. The incident reflects a misalignment between industry requirements and available resources, which is a major concern for recruiters across sectors. There seems to be an inherent disconnect between curriculumbased learning at the institution level, with the requisite ‚Äòjob ready‚Äô skills needed by Indian corporates. Since Independence, technical education in our country has grown into a fairly large-sized system, offering opportunities for education and training in a wide variety of trades and disciplines at a certificate, diploma, degree, postgraduate degree and doctoral levels in institutions throughout the country.

The main objective of the technical education is that it makes students skilled and technically fit for industries. In other words people with sound technical knowledge cannot remain unemployed. A few observations seem pertinent. First, there has been increasing concern about the employment gap and skills gap. Second, more than half of India‚Äôs population of 1.3 billion is below the age of 25 and finally, the annual demand for new jobs in India is estimated at 12-15 million.

According to the All India Survey 2018 by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) covering 534 Lok Sabha constituencies, spread among various demographics, ‚Äòbetter employment opportunities‚Äô tops the priorities of voters ‚Äì it comes as no surprise though given the state of affairs. ‚ÄúThe single most important thing I find missing in our education system is its ability to help individuals understand why they are studying what they‚Äôre studying; what are their strengths and how can they impact society,‚Äù said Ketan Kapoor, CEO and co-founder, Mettl, an assessment and skill-measurement company.

‚ÄúThe second reason is this culture of working really hard, to aim to be a perfectionist. It is important to understand that the student or the prospective employee is competing not just among peer groups in India but globally,‚Äù he added. India has been witnessing the age of science and technology for long resulting in a huge demand for technical education. The pattern of life evolving in the age is very much different from the one we find in our society even some years back. Technical education contributes immensely to the education system in general and plays an essential role in the social and economic development of our country.

Besides, in this age of joblessness, only technical education can assure us of a good opportunity for employment and successful career. However, the country‚Äôs technical education is beset with many shortcomings India‚Äôs predicament of substandard engineering education is now widely believed. It has left engineers coming out of most of the institutes almost unemployable. There have been some intermittent efforts to improve the situation but most of the efforts either fell short of desired level or failed to bring about any significant changes. However, in order to scale up the overall technical education in the North Eastern Region a regional workshop of the Directors of Technical Education and Principals of polytechnic education of North Eastern Region was held recently (25-27 April, 2019) in Guwahati.

It was hosted by Directorate of Technical Education, Assam under the aegis of National Institute of Technical Teachers‚Äô Training & Research (NITTTR), Kolkata. As many as six Directors of Technical Education belonging to various states, 40 Principals of different Polytechnic colleges from North Eastern Region and faculties and experts from NITTTR attended the workshop. NITTTR, Kolkata was the first among four such institutes (other three being at Chandigarh, Bhopal & Chennai) established by the Dept. of Education, MHRD, Govt. of India as a fully centrally-funded autonomous institution for providing pre & in-service training to teachers and staff of Degree and Diploma level training institutions.

It‚Äôs also mandated for conducting various activities related to quality improvement of the technical education system of the country. The government in 2003 accorded national status to this institute, (along with the three sister institutes) in recognition of the contribution of these institutes for the expert service rendered for overall improvement of quality of Technical Education System. The 3-day workshop was very methodically organised, with wellcurated content.

The workshop‚Äôs programme schedule set the tone for an atmosphere where people felt comfortable deliberating, expressing their thoughts and learning from one another. The individual participants brought to the fore significant issues ranging from shortage of faculties to lack of internet connection, from poor infrastructure to outdated laboratory equipment to severe supply shortage of electricity and water.

Although All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) had assured to address some of the issues but the onus is on state governments. The economic development and growth of a nation depends largely on technical hands. And, therefore India must more meaningfully prioritise quality technical education to boost the prosperity of the nation.

India is in an awful mess given that unemployability is a bigger worry than unemployment. Technology is changing at a brisk pace, so much so that it‚Äôs challenging to grasp. Thus realising the dream of modern India lies greatly with efficient ways of skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling of country‚Äôs rising youth population. The larger question is whether governments both at the centre and states will be able to crack the unemployability problem, or will the problem crack the governments.

The Problem: Unemployment or Unemployability?,"Unemployment today has grown to become a major area of concern on a global level. Despite increasing number of educational institutions, growing volumes of academic courses, and booming industries, unemployment in India seems to be on a constant rise.

In a country like India, inspite of there being is a cultural focus on academic learning and professional qualification, a wide disconnect between education and acquiring skills can be observed. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GRE) for Indian higher education has been just 34% which is very low in comparison to developed countries that have a GRE of 56%. In spite of this, close to 60 lakh students graduate every year in several disciplines. Very few of them are deemed fit for employment. Over 70% of these graduates lack basic employable skills and quality. It is estimated that 10 lakh people will join the labour force every month for the coming 20 years and most of them have inadequate training. This may lead to many layoffs.

In a volatile and ever-evolving environment like that of the IT industry, mere formal educational qualifications are not enough. It is necessary to have the relevant IT skills which are allied to the dynamic changes in IT as an industry as well as job roles. Recruiters today, also prefer candidates with high learnability, adaptability and scalability. The lack of these qualities is becoming a strategic concern.

It is emerging more clearly than ever before that what needs to be fixed is unemployability. Unemployability is the illness and unemployment is merely a symptom thereof. The illness needs to be treated and not the symptom.

The skills mismatch is a stark reality staring into the eyes of graduates. There are millions of graduates hoping to start working, but soon realize that the employers are looking for skills that they never even got. This is when young people end up experiencing the bitter and sometimes almost impossible campus-to-corporate transition. While it is indisputably hard on the students‚Äô side, it is also hard for organizations to find suitable candidates for their many positions. There is a severe shortage of progressive institutions that provide updated, quality, industry-oriented higher education due to lack of awareness and absence of industry orientation.

While India is now shrugging off its ‚Äòdeveloping‚Äô country image, majority of the education sector largely lacks the technology and infrastructure needed for hands-on training in the digital sector. This is when the youth are at a disadvantage in the job market by the lack of skills in terms of application.

The Solution

While basic graduation and technical education can be seen as an entry point, students need to invest in employable skills in relevant technologies with specific learning paths. These learning paths should ultimately set the learners on a career path.

The IT landscape is constantly changing and it is the need of the hour for prospective and existing workforce to continuously upgrade their skills in order to contribute to the growth of the organisation, industries, society and the economy. It is time for individuals, institutions and enterprises to come together and engage with relevant platforms to address this issue. The panacea would be in embracing a holistic approach to learning and architecting relevant training methodologies and curricula that align with the industry requirements and job demands.

The current learning ecosystem needs to thoughtfully consider how to architect learning programmes that can be further customised to meet learning objectives while also supporting different learning styles in holistic environments with an outcome-based approach. By responding to the niche expectations of the 21st-century students, and eliminating restrictions regarding what constitutes a learning space, we need to go beyond the confines of traditional methods. It is the need of the hour that we become facilitators and enablers of an enhanced learning process.

The largely adopted brick-and-mortar approach to learning that dates back to early 18th Century has remained virtually unchanged ‚Äì until now. The rise of new pedagogies (such as Blended Learning) has been dominating today‚Äôs educational and learning reforms. Despite the challenges, lack of understanding and a steep learning curve, embracing blended learning is increasingly less of an option and more of a mandate.

Learning as a concept needs to change. It needs to happen beyond the limitations of time and space. It becomes an immersive and engaging indulgence with a series of rich experiences on the pathway to get more employable, and a result fight unemployment. Multiple approaches are needed to solve a problem as large as this. But we need to remember, what needs to be fixed is unemployability, then unemployment will fix itself.

Lessons from India‚Äôs jobless growth story,"Jobless growth means that the economy under consideration is experiencing growth, i.e., increasing GDP but at the same time either employment is constant or is in fact decreasing. This term was coined by economist Nick Perna in the early 1990s. Policy makers, academicians and political analysts have time and again shifted focus on the alarming situation of jobless growth in India, especially in the last two decades. The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) estimates for the year 2017-18 show that India‚Äôs joblessness was 6.1 per cent of the labour force, which is amongst the highest since 1972-73.

In fact, this unemployment crisis seems to be cutting across location and gender. At 27.2 per cent, urban women are worst-affected, followed by their male counterparts at 18.7 per cent. More men in villages (17.4 per cent) are jobless than women (13.6 per cent). Although it cannot be disputed that the presence of jobless growth in India has been apparent for the past decade and more, the numbers today have become strikingly high. Starting from 2000, India was second only to China in terms of GDP growth. What is being hailed in India is the potential of demographic dividend ‚Äì the large percentage of labour force (essentially in the age group 18-60 years) which is available for employment.

This age group is called the independent workforce as against the dependent population which consists of the age group 0-18 years (children) and above 60 years (older people). Thus, to understand whether India can take advantages of her demographic dividend it is imperative to examine whether growing GDP numbers have actually translated into increasing employment figures. As the economy develops, there is a conventional pattern of a movement of surplus labour from the traditional agriculture or informal sectors to the modern sector (industrial or formal sectors) of the economy.

This is not merely restricted to the theoretical understanding of the models like Lewis and Harris-Todaro but a similar pattern has also been exhibited by the East Asian tiger economies namely Taiwan and South Korea who had achieved a turning point in their development curve by the mid 1990S. As surplus labour gets exhausted, the real wages start increasing. This movement of higher wages essentially means an improvement in the skill and educational levels of the workforce along with the emergence of new industries which demand higher labour skills.

But what has been noticed in India is a slow rate of non-agricultural job generation despite massive escalation in the GDP. Manufacturing sector which is deemed to be the backbone of any economy has largely remained as a ‚Äúmissing-middle‚Äù for India in terms of the employment generation. The trends show that the size of the manufacturing workforce in the country has actually declined between 2004-05 and 2009-10 and in fact India experienced the highest GDP growth rate between 2005-2008 (2005-2006: 9.48%; 2006-2007: 9.57% and 2007-08: 9.32%).

The sluggish growth of the manufacturing sector has remained as a continuous challenge for India‚Äôs growth story. What can be deduced after studying the estimates from various quinquennial rounds of NSSO‚Äôs Employment- Unemployment Schedule is the behaviour of agricultural employment. When the GDP growth rate was the fastest i.e. between 2005-2008, there was a stagnation in the agricultural sector. The growth of the agricultural sector had come down from 3.62 per cent in 1990-91 to 1.97 per cent by 2004-05 and the share of agriculture in GDP has registered a steady decline from 36.4 per cent in 1982-83 to 18.5 per cent in 2006-07.

Yet this sector continues to support approximately 50 per cent of the workforce. Agricultural employment declined during the second half of the 2000s, which led to the slow growth of overall employment in India. Yet another unique feature of India‚Äôs journey of jobless growth is the employment pattern registered for rural women. Between 2004-05 and 2009-10, nearly 22 million women left agricultural work. While the first decade of the millennium witnessed a steep rise in female agricultural employment which was distress driven, the second had an equivalent withdrawal of women from the labour force.

What has been noticed as the possible reason for the movement of women back to the household during the latter period is improvement in the availability of income-earning opportunities for male members of the family. Thus, one can conclude that women enter the workforce only to supplement the income of male members of the family and if they start earning reasonably well, they withdraw from the workforce. This could then be taken to be one of the factors of declining employment while growth was increasing.

The recent trends characterize Indian labour market by three features: 1) There is a predominance of agriculture and the informal sector in total employment. This means that a majority of workers are self-employed and in low quality employment. There has been a slow growth of labour productivity in these sectors. 2) Poverty and distress lead to a situation of vulnerability where participation in the labour market is not out of choice but is governed by changes in the income level. This is clearly indicated by the number of women entering the labour force. 3) The decision to enter and exit the labour market is primarily a response to household earnings.

Besides the above structural inadequacies with respect to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of the Indian economy, the decision to go in for demonetisation and faulty implementation of GST in recent times has had a serious impact on growth in India. Raghuram Rajan, ex-governor of the Reserve Bank of India, while addressing an audience at the University of Berkley in November 2018 stated that a 7 per cent GDP growth rate is not enough for the kind of people entering the labour market. India needs to create millions of jobs a year to take advantage of the demographic dividend and this can only happen if the Indian economy boosts up both the manufacturing and the agricultural sector.

Stop gap and knee-jerk reaction to the above crisis is not going to help the economy in the long-run. What has been seen in recent months is that the distress in the agricultural and informal sectors have now percolated to the formal sectors. This can be clearly seen by the shutdown policies of the automobile industry, the FMCG sectors amongst others as also the stress in the MSME sectors. All of the above requires recognition of the problem which is equally of the demand-side as it is of the supply side and simultaneously addressing it in all sectors of the economy.

Not by the 3‚ÄôR‚Äôs alone,"As India plunges into an unemployment abyss, comes the grimmer report of the unemployability abyss. Close on the heels of the data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showing India‚Äôs October unemployment rate at 8.5 per cent, the highest since August 2016, come extremely worrisome tidings from the Global Business Coalition for Education, 2030 skills scorecard, prepared by the Unicef and Education Commission.

Of the 300 million children, supposedly the key to India‚Äôs demographic dividend, set to pass school by 2030, 47 per cent will bit a roadblock when seeking entry into the workforce, irrespective of the vocation that they might wish to engage in. Attributing this chasm in the skilling to ‚Äúlow quality of education and sub-optimal vocational training‚Äù, the report clearly establishes that imparting the three ‚ÄòR‚Äôs, Indian style, without insights into how the graduating classes will fit into the rural or urban, tech or nontech, workspace, is making much of the school education system irrelevant for the students and indeed disempowering the future citizen.

Along with the equally appalling numbers from the rest of South Asia, the situation assumes explosive dimensions for the aspirational youth across the region, a situation that may still be avoided by a concerted shift in the teaching paradigm to address current job needs.

The daily addition to the rolls of these poorly-qualified job seekers is ‚Äúnearly 100,000 young South Asians‚Äù, as the Unicef emphasizes, with ‚Äúalmost half of them not on track to find 21st century jobs‚Äù.

The unfortunate circumstances created by their often inconsequential passage of a decade in school is not ameliorated by any corrective mechanism in higher education, which in fact intensifies the malaise; another ailment diagnosed by several studies over the past few years. Thus much of the education ecosystem is rendered out of sync with the knowledge ~ and even the not-soknowledge ~ based economy.

Back in 2016, an Assocham study talked of 93 per cent of business management graduates being unemployable; only seven per cent standing a chance of participating productively in the management ecosystem because their schools did not have the rigorous academic instruction structure considered de rigeur for grappling with management complexities in the world today.

Matters do not improve with engineering education either, with upwards of 80 per cent of graduating engineers being deemed unemployable for want of technical, cognitive and linguistic requirements for softwarerelated jobs and certainly not for such esoteric spheres as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and mobile development.

Regrettably, schools do not even train students for very simple, mechanical work that could make them useful for the rural sector, for instance.

The bottomline, for a populace ill equipped to handle livelihood issues is the perpetuation of poverty and faltering economic growth. The writing is clearly on the wall today; as is India‚Äôs unpreparedness to address mass poverty clubbed with depression and anxiety.",https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/not-3rs-alone-1502823349.html,
Solution for unemployment,"The Indian economy continues to expand. As a corollary of rapid economic expansion more jobs are available today than before, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

Most Indian leaders see the growth of the manufacturing sector as a solution for unemployment and underemployment across the country. Demand in the developed world for manufactured goods has led more than one exporting nation to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty.

In spite of the rise in automation, leaders and intellectuals in India, believe that a manufacturing-led export-driven growth model is a way to superior economic growth.

Industries are creating more jobs than ever before: Potentially, within seven years the size of the manufacturing sector in India may generate huge revenues. Be it in manufacturing, construction or mining, new jobs are being created in India and the pace of new job growth is expected to continue rising.

Hence the employment landscape is already being transformed into one, which generates jobs in relatively higher paying manufacturing industries. Since the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990‚Äôs, a third of the new jobs have been created in the construction sector.

Manufacturing to pave the way to future prosperity: Manufacturing create products by using raw materials or components. Over the next 5 to 7 years, millions of new jobs are expected to be created in the domestic manufacturing sector.

Indian economists believe that the manufacturing sector will comprise of a quarter of the size of the Indian economy by 2025. Currently, manufacturing‚Äôs share in the Indian economy is approximately 16 per cent.

The largest number of jobs that will be created may be low paying unskilled or semiskilled jobs that nonetheless, for innumerable diligent and enterprising young workers, could pay the way for a financially rewarding and personally fulfilling career. The creation of a large number of such jobs will help move millions of Indians into the middleclass.

High value manufacturing jobs exist today: However what is truly exciting is that a significant number of jobs in this sector require much technical expertise, which comes after years of education and training.

Graduates and mechanical engineers and those with post-graduate degrees today have ample opportunity to thrive in this field in India.

An expanding domestic manufacturing sector will lead to the creation of many more such well-paying jobs that will be able to employ young Indians for decades to come.

Specifically, there are attractive jobs for engineers and for those with advanced degrees in production management and quality testing.

Furthermore, today there also many ancillary jobs in areas such as procurement, storage, supply chain, finance and accounting and the availability of such jobs will also increase in the future.

Manufacturing industries have created tertiary jobs: Job opportunities today extend beyond simple assembly line manufacturing jobs. Many white collar jobs have been created by the manufacturing industry in tertiary industries such as customer support and management.

Much of the demand for skilled engineers, draftsmen, programmers, electricians and technicians is being created by the manufacturing industry in India.

Furthermore, rising consumer expectations have led manufacturers to take quality initiatives and hire production experts who ensure finished products meet quality standards.

Indian manufacturers have also realised the need for quick and efficient customer service, which has led to the direct creation of numerous support and backend jobs.

PPE‚Äôs in era of manufacturing led growth: As the manufacturing sector expands, even more people will be employed in the innumerable factories and workshops that will manufacture products in India.

After the creation of new and varied jobs in hazardous manufacturing environments, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) will also grow.

Already most large and small Indian manufacturers recognise the importance of worker safety and so there is great demand for PPE across India. The manufacturers of personal protective equipment are themselves, manufacturers.

As the number of factories and industries grows in India, the size of the PPE manufacturing sector will also grow. Manufacturers of safety equipment create safety products that are in great demand by those in the construction and mining industries.

The buying and selling of these equipments have also created numerous new jobs. For the next few decades, the number of jobs created by manufacturers of PPE will increase in lockstep with the increase in the number of manufacturing jobs in India.

A better skilled India,"Despite the contrary view of Niti Aayog, unemployment in India has reached alarming proportions. As of now, 4.83 crore job-seekers are registered with the employment exchanges‚Ä¶ of whom only 3.39 lakh have been placed. These statistics do not cover masons and labourers, who seek employment only in the informal sector. These figures also do not include rural unemployment and under-employment, for which no reliable statistics are available.

Such a high level of unemployment entails a humongous cost in terms of human capital going waste. There is a still greater social cost because parents who had spent beyond their capacity to educate their children at expensive private institutions feel duped by the system; the children themselves feel inadequate and depressed. Often one sees an unedifying spectacle of thousands of highly qualified young men and women competing for some lowly job, which is much below their capabilities. There are reports of lakhs of unfilled posts of primary school teachers, constables etc. This is a major anomaly.

Such paradoxes have their genesis in the way Indians imagine the desiderata of a job. For many, a permanent Government job means the freedom to work according to their whims‚Ä¶ seldom with a view to achieve organisational goals. Since even the lowest Government functionary wields enormous power, the effect of such a lackadaisical attitude is disastrous for good governance. On the other hand, the Government, being a model employer, provides its employees with all benefits which a prosperous company provides. No wonder the Government is not enamoured of the idea of providing further employment though the shortfall in ranks often results in sub-standard services for the poor citizen.

India contends with such a high level of unemployment primarily because our social planners have failed to take note of ever-changing job requirements. At the time of Independence, with few exceptions, education was only for the rich. Many zamindars and moneyed people went to college, not to prepare themselves for employment but only to add the letters B.A. or M.A. to their names. For those so inclined, a good arts degree was enough to land a good job. The varna vyavastha took care of the aspirations of the rest (about whom no one bothered). However, with the democratisation of education and an exponential growth in population, unemployment posed a forbidding challenge in the early 1970s. Nonetheless, the economy was expanding and there still was no real problem for well-qualified youths in landing a job ~ even if it was in the USA.

The advent of computerisation in the first decade of the current millennium exacerbated the unemployment problem to calamitous levels. Suddenly, entry-level office jobs became scarce. At the same time, liberalisation filled our markets with high-class imported goods which slowed down the growth of the indigenous manufacturing sector. These developments ensured that the growth in jobs did not keep pace with the growth in the economy. Overseas opportunities also declined because the entire globe became a single market so far as goods and services were concerned. At the same time our traditional job markets like the US and the Middle East put in place firewalls to prevent the entry of non-citizens.

The process and skill-sets required to land a good job in India are completely at odds with the processes and skill-sets required in other countries. The Civil Services Examination is the gold standard for conducting a job test. This examination, which tests around 8 lakh job aspirants, mainly in general topics, takes around 18 months and selects only 1000 persons. A similarly structured examination for bank officers has 18 lakh applicants, selecting only 3,000 persons. The cost and inefficiency of such exercises is evident but all Government examinations mimic this model. So we have similar examinations for geologists, foresters, inspectors and clerks resulting in extraordinary wastage of time and manpower with attendant frustration.

Our job position can only worsen given the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotics which have led to a situation where humans would face an uncertain future in the job market. Robots are fast replacing humans in high precision factories in Europe. If we are to manufacture high quality goods, we would have to follow suit, leading to job losses. Already, online sellers are cornering the retail market ~ a development which portends a gloomy future for small businesses. Driverless cars, powered by AI, have the potential of making millions of drivers jobless‚Ä¶ though given our chaotic traffic and potholed roads it would take some time for such cars to reach our shores.

So we have two challenges before us. After tackling the current unemployment problem, we would have to re-skill our workforce for the future. Skilling India was a commendable initiative, which never took off. Sadly, before the Skilling India programme could commence in right earnest we are faced with a situation where traditional jobs are vanishing and totally new ones are taking their place. Obviously, the time has come to re-imagine the jobs and job requirements of the future. Trying to look into the future, one can safely assume that the agriculture and infrastructure sectors will always remain relevant. With more time and money available, tourism, entertainment, leisure and sports are some of the sectors which may bloom in the future. To be competitive in the new job market, we would have to visualise the skill-sets required for these new age jobs. Then, we would have to impart the requisite skill-sets to our youth in our colleges and universities.

Finally, we will have to construct exact mathematical models to predict job requirements in the emerging sectors so that we can avoid a glut in some sectors and drought in others. Our current system is so unprepared for the real world that even the elite IITs are looking at an unprecedented crunch in placements for many branches of engineering ~ a situation that could easily have been avoided by juggling courses.

Re-skilling would be difficult, requiring a thorough revamp of education as we know it. The generalist education model would have to be discarded. We would have to direct school children to the vocational stream of their choice right from the secondary level. Courses would have to be specifically designed for all categories of occupations be it farmer, shopkeeper, office worker, mechanic etc. Re-skilling would ultimately lead to excellence in all branches of enterprise.

To avoid unemployment, it would have to be ensured that the input in each stream would be proportionate to the anticipated vacancies in that particular line at the time students complete their courses. We may keep the German model in view, which works on similar lines and yield excellent results.

Thomas Carlyle once observed, ‚ÄúA man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune‚Äôs inequality exhibits under this sun.‚Äù (Chartism) Unfortunately, we have a large number of desperate jobseekers. To prevent human misery, if for no other reason, we have to ensure that all those who are willing to work get gainful employment.",https://www.thestatesman.com/opinion/better-skilled-india-1502539103.html,
The Gig Economy,"Hardly a generation ago, a person with a decent university degree, if he tried hard enough, could land a job proportionate to his qualifications. Today, we have the spectre of engineers, post-graduates and MBAs vying for peons‚Äô and constables‚Äô jobs. A long-delayed report released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation shows unemployment at a 45 year high of 6.1 per cent and urban unemployment still higher at 7.8 per cent.

With the working age population slated to rise by 96.5 million during 2021-31 and by 41.5 million during 2031- 41, the coming days would see the pressure on jobs increasing to horrifying levels. Yet, at the same time, corporate honchos are bemoaning the non-availability of qualified persons for jobs in their organisations. It would appear that there is a complete mismatch between the qualifications that job-seekers have and the qualifications desired by job givers.

Our present education system trains students for clerical jobs which are now extinct thanks to the computerisation of business processes. The almost complete absence of students for arts, science and even engineering courses in most colleges ~ which has led to the closure of many educational institutions ~ shows that there is no future for mediocre students in traditional jobs. Decision makers are still required, for which employers look to top students of top colleges. Almost thirty lakh positions are lying vacant in Central and State Governments which the Government fights shy of filling for various reasons, mainly because persons hired by the Government soon forget their duties and insist on an amplified sense of entitlement.

Practical reasons like the existence of many types of quotas increases the difficulty in hiring a person to work in the Government. To get over such problems, the Government has started outsourcing its ministerial and menial work in a big way which results in poor service to the public and reduces the chances of regular employment in Government jobs. With regular employment opportunities shrinking both in the Government and the private sector, the jobs on offer are of a different kind ~ drivers for Ola and Uber, delivery boys for Swiggy and Zomato and repairmen for Urban Clap.

The term ‚Äúgig‚Äù has been coined for such jobs, that is, for jobs for which workers are paid for each individual gig (piece of work) they do ~ such as food delivery or a car journey ~ instead of monthly salary/days wage/hourly wage. ‚ÄúGig workers‚Äù reduce operational costs and companies like Uber employ ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers on a large scale. The downside is that gig workers cannot be relied on for confidentiality and proper teamwork, which lessens the quality of their output.

Yet, the movement towards a ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù is a world- wide phenomenon, with almost 30 per cent of the workforce in the US and Europe being employed in the ‚Äúgig economy.‚Äù ‚ÄúGig‚Äù jobs can be a perfect solution for people who do not want to work for regular hours or at a defined workplace, but ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs cannot be said to be jobs in the sense we understand it. If backed by a social security system, like that of the West, taking up ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs may still make sense but in India with no social security worth the name, ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs are taken up only in desperation.

What are called ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs today were more correctly classified as under-employment by economists like John Maynard Keynes. Studying under-employment at the time of the Great Depression, Keynes concluded that economies land into an undesirable under-employment equilibrium because of oversupply and insufficient demand for labour. There is said to be oversupply when the labour force is over-educated for the skill level of available employment opportunities in the economy. Insufficient demand amplifies the problem.

At a time of undesirable under-employment equilibrium, well-qualified workers face a tougher job market and have to settle for jobs originally meant for less skilled individuals. Learning a lesson from the rampant under-employment during the Great Depression, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics calculates the ‚ÄúUnder-employment Rate‚Äù every month from 1948. Regrettably, under-employment is not an issue in mainstream discussions in India. Even under-employment statistics are not maintained by the Government.

Maybe, for this reason, our leaders laud and treat the jobs created by the ‚Äúgig‚Äù economy on par with regular jobs, little realising that a rising level of ‚Äúgig‚Äù employment is a symptom of a slowing economy and ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs are a slow poison for workers because ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers work for extremely long hours in pitiable conditions. Labour laws classify ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as independent contractors which means they have no fixed working hours, no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holidays or sickness pay.

The wretched condition of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers has persuaded a London Employment Tribunal to classify ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as ‚Äúworkers‚Äù, entitled to basic rights. A fortnight ago, the state of California passed a bill that requires companies like Uber to treat ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as employees. Reacting belatedly, our Government has proposed a Social Security Code that would, inter alia, address the problems of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers.

However, the proposed Social Security Code would subsume eight central labour Acts, which may result in delay and lack of focus on the plight of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers. ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù and ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù are excellent programmes to tackle unemployment and under-employment, but the problem is that little has been done to push these programmes. Reacting to the current slowdown in the economy, the Government is trying to revive the economy from the supply side by cutting tax rates and re-capitalising Public Sector Banks, which would increase investment. Given the time lag between investment and production, we may have to wait for some time for employment to pick up.

Quicker results would have followed had the Government invested the same amount of money in rural jobs and infrastructure. If we want to avoid becoming a permanent ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù we have to link our education system to trade and industry to ensure that a student coming out of the education system has requisite skills for the jobs on offer and there is no oversupply in any discipline. The New Education Policy (NEP) could have ensured such a synergy but making students job-ready is not an objective of the NEP. That said, the NEP has a commendable intention of promoting vocational education but given the huge paucity of institutions imparting vocational education, the desired results may be difficult to achieve in the near future.

Probably, it is time the Government stepped in with a wellstructured employment generation programme to ameliorate the misery of the youth who are forced to take up jobs much below their qualifications. Jobless growth is a terrifying prospect.

Tripura: Unemployment paints a gloomy picture as BJP govt turns one,"The Bharatiya Janata Party, which came to power on the mantra of ‚ÄúSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas‚Äù to lead a coalition government in Tripura completed its first year in office on 9 March. According to Chief Minister Biplab Deb, Tripura is on the path towards becoming a model state. One of the major issues, which BJP promised to solve, was unemployment. However, after one year of rule, it seems the BJP has failed to curb the burning issue of Tripura unemployment.

The data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy lucidly indicates that the employment scenario continues to be on a sticky wicket. The CMIE data of February 2019 puts the Tripura unemployment rate at 26.1 per cent, which is the highest in the country. It is to be mentioned that during February 2018, the last month of the Left government, the percentage of unemployment was 30.2 per cent, which was again the highest in the country.

The CMIE data of February this year compared to February last year points out that there has been a 4.1 per cent reduction and this may be seen as a small achievement of the BJP government. However, this is the other side of the picture. Only in March and April 2018, Tripura didn‚Äôt feature as the state with the highest percentage of unemployment in the country. But for the later months, barring July, till the latest report of February, Tripura registered the most number of unemployed people in India. In September, the unemployment percentage rose to 39.1 per cent ‚Äî the highest within a year. In October and November, the percentage was more than 30 per cent. These figures clearly show that the Deb-led BJP government has failed to curb rising unemployment in the state, which was the main election issue highlighted by the saffron party during its Assembly election campaign.

The CMIE data of Tripura is available from September 2017. In that year, Tripura‚Äôs unemployment was the highest in India at 19.4 per cent. For the later three months ‚Äî October, November and December ‚Äî the percentage was reduced to 8.5, 8.2 and 13.2, respectively. Unemployment again rose to 31.2 and 30.2 per cent respectively in January and February 2019. So, it means that during the Left era, Tripura was not always the state with the highest percentage of unemployed in the country.

The state government‚Äôs dramatic decision in August last year of cancelling ongoing recruitment raised eyebrows about its seriousness to control the issue of joblessness. The order included cancellations of exams that were to be held under the Tripura Public Service Commission, which affected around 14,000 candidates. Many alleged that the decision was mainly political rather than administrative as it cancelled the recruitment earlier initiated by the CPM-led Left government. There were allegations that by cancelling the TPSC recruitment, the BJP government was trying to dictate an autonomous body.

Also, interviews taken under the monitoring of High Court of Tripura in January 2018 for the Tripura Civil Services and Tripura Police Services were cancelled by the state government inviting more criticism.

Recently, as mentioned by a leading media wire of Tripura, the High Court in the state has issued a show cause notice to the government questioning it about the cancellation of the recruitment drive for filling up 838 posts of male constables. The decision of the High Court came after four writ petitions by the job aspirants, who had qualified for the posts in 2017.

In the writ petitions, they stated that they were qualified for the posts but due to the declaration of the Assembly polls, the police authority couldn‚Äôt release letters of offer. However, the new government cancelled the entire process of interviews.

Last year, in August, a news daily of the state reported that the Left government was ready with a list of around 2,000 candidates for the Tripura State Rifles and Tripura Police but that couldn‚Äôt be released due to the declaration of the Assembly elections. Later, the recruitment process was again done away with by the new BJP government.

Also, there have been allegations against the BJP government of limiting the vacant posts of the Teachers‚Äô Eligibility Test. As local media reported, the present government declared only 180 vacant posts for TET-I, against the advertisements of 6,422 vacant posts done by the previous Left government. In case of TET-II, the number of vacant posts declared by the CPM government was 1,470. But the new government recruited only 319 teachers. Last year, Deb in an interview to a national daily, had spoken of creating 700,000 jobs within 30 months. But after the completion of 12 months, the ground situation presents a gloomy picture regarding jobs.

Curbing unemployment in the state was the major election promise of BJP. However, the BJP government seems to have failed to control joblessness in the state with the percentage of unemployment even higher under its rule. Tripura is still figuring as the state with the most number of unemployed in the country. These facts question the seriousness of the BJP government in solving the most burning issue of the state.

"50 lakh jobs lost after demonetisation, youth, women worst hit: Report","Nearly 50 lakh people in India lost their jobs between 2016-2018, a report said highlighting that the ‚Äúbeginning of the decline‚Äù coincided with demonetisation, although ‚Äúno direct causal relationship could be established‚Äù between the trends.

The report by Azim Premji University‚Äôs titled State of Working India was based on the CMIE-CPDX data that highlighted India‚Äôs unemployed were mostly the youth.

‚ÄúIn general, women are much worse affected than men. They have higher unemployment rates, as well as lower labour force participation rates,‚Äù it added.

The report revealed that unemployment, in general, has risen steadily post 2011. Both the Periodic Labour Force Survey and the CMIE-CPDX report the overall unemployment rate to be around 6 per cent in 2018, double of what it was in the decade from 2000 to 2011.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmong urban women, graduates are 10 per cent of the working age population but 34 per cent of the unemployed. The age group 20-24 years is hugely over-represented among the unemployed.

‚ÄúAmong urban men, for example, this age group accounts for 13.5 per cent of the working age population but 60 per cent of the unemployed.‚Äù

Besides, the report noted that ‚Äúin addition to rising open unemployment among the higher educated, the less educated (and likely, informal) workers have also seen job losses and reduced work opportunities since 2016.

Earlier in February, the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO‚Äôs) periodic labour force survey (PLFS) had stated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017.

The NSSO report was reportedly based on data collected between July 2017 and June 2018 and is the first official survey post-demonetisation.

However, the NITI Aayog debunked claims of jobless growth saying that the report was not a final one.

Earlier, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had stated that 1.5 million jobs were lost just in the first four months of 2017‚Äîimmediately after demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes.

The issue hogged the limelight after two independent members of the National Statistical Commission ‚Äî acting Chairman PC Mohanan and JV Meenakshi ‚Äî resigned on January 28 over a disagreement with the Government on certain issues.

One issue pertains to the government withholding the release of the results of NSSO‚Äôs quinquennial survey, for the year 2017-18 even though the commission approved the report. This gains significance in the wake of the government being criticised for a scarcity of jobs in the country.

Gandhi‚Äôs remarks came while speaking to the media outside the Lok Sabha where he said, ‚ÄúPM Modi‚Äôs style is to distract the country from core issues. He talks of Congress, Jawaharlal Nehru, Pakistan, etc but not of core issues.‚Äù

He reiterated his attack on the Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman‚Äôs longest speech during the budget presentation by saying, ‚ÄúThe biggest issue today is unemployment and jobs, we asked PM many times, but he did not say a word on this. Earlier, the Finance Minister gave a long speech but she also did not say a word on it.‚Äù

Alleging PM Modi of speaking on ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù issues, he said, ‚ÄúThe PM is distracting people from real issues by talking about Jawaharlal Nehru, Pakistan and Bangladesh.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe government is not concerned about economic issues impacting the country,‚Äù he added.

On Wednesday, during an election campaigning in Delhi for the upcoming Assembly polls, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had said the agitated youth will cane PM Modi within six months.

PM Modi took it to the Parliament while replying to the motion of thanks to the President‚Äôs speech and said he will prepare his back to get it strong by doing regular ‚ÄúSurya Namaskar‚Äù in these six months for the canning by the youth.

He also attacked Rahul Gandhi in the Parliament in a veiled manner when the Congress leader intervened in his speech. ‚ÄúFor some people, tubelight takes time,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe atmosphere in India has changed in the last five years. Brotherhood and peace have vanished from society. Many of you will say that this happened due to Modi, the RSS and the BJP,‚Äù Rahul Gandhi had said during a public rally.

He had also alleged the BJP government at centre as well as AAP government in Delhi for remaining silent on the issue of unemployment.

NSSO job report citing high unemployment rate ‚Äònot final‚Äô: NITI Aayog,"NITI Aayog on Thursday debunked claims of jobless growth after the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO‚Äôs) periodic labour force survey (PLFS), stated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017.

The government said that the report was yet to be approved.

The survey states that unemployment was last this high in 1972-73. To compare, the unemployment rate in the country had gone down to 2.2 per cent in 2011-12, according to NSSO data.

NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar, who had previously mounted a defence of lowering of UPA-era GDP growth rates, at a press conference on Thursday said the report cited by the newspaper ‚Äúis not finalised. It is a draft report‚Äù.

Refusing to comment on the content of the news report, he said the government will release its employment report by March after collating quarter-on-quarter data.

He also debunked claims of jobless growth, saying how can a country grow at an average of 7 per cent without employment.

NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who too was present at the conference, said India is creating adequate number of jobs for new entrants, but ‚Äúprobably we are not creating high-quality jobs‚Äù.

The issue hogged the limelight after two independent members of the National Statistical Commission ‚Äî acting Chairman PC Mohanan and JV Meenakshi ‚Äî resigned on January 28 over a disagreement with the Government on certain issues.

One issue pertains to the government withholding the release of the results of NSSO‚Äôs quinquennial survey, for the year 2017-18 even though the commission approved the report. This gains significance in the wake of the government being criticised for a scarcity of jobs in the country.

The NSSO report was based on data collected between July 2017 and June 2018 and is the first official survey post-demonetisation.

The news report further said that unemployment was higher in urban areas (7.8 per cent) as compared to 5.3 per cent in rural areas of the country.

Earlier, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had stated that 1.5 million jobs were lost just in the first four months of 2017‚Äîimmediately after demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes.

The NSSO job report was previously planned to be released in December 2018.

Gandhi later indicated that the party will launch a campaign against the Modi government ahead of the assembly polls later this year and the Lok Sabha polls next year.

‚ÄúThe CWC met today (Saturday).

It‚Äôs official: Unemployment rate at 45-year high,"It is now official that the country has indeed been witnessing jobless growth.

Months after rejecting the claim by a leaked report that India‚Äôs unemployment rate had touched a 45-year high, the government admitted the same on Friday with the latest data showing that joblessness had indeed touched 6.1 per cent in the 12-month period from July 2017 to June 2018.

The government had earlier brushed aside a leaked official report on the country‚Äôs poor job scenario and maintained that the unemployment data was yet to be finalised.

The Centre had come under fire for witholding the key macro data, with the opposition parties alleging that it was a deliberate attempt to hide its non-performance.

Moreover, some members of the Statistical Commission had earlier resigned to protest against the government decision to withold the data.

The official release has come a day after Narendra Modi took oath as Prime Minister for the second time on Thursday in the backdrop of high public expectations on jobs and economic growth.

The official data showed 7.8 per cent of all employable urban youth as being jobless during the survey period, while the percentage for the rural areas stood 5.3 per cent.

The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons unemployed among the total the labour force. Nearly 10 million youth join the country‚Äôs workforce every year.

The data poses a huge challenge to the Modi government which has returned to power for the second term on the promise that it will set policies right and ensure faster economic growth and employment.

The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate has plunged to its lowest in the last five years to touch 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19.

"‚ÄòAll-round mismanagement‚Äô by the Govt responsible for economic slowdown, says Former PM Manmohan Singh","As the GDP growth fell further in the last quarter, former prime minister and finance minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said the state of country‚Äôs economy was ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù and urged the government to put aside ‚Äúvendetta politics‚Äù and reach out to sane voices to steer the economy out of the ‚Äúman-made crisis.‚Äù

The Congress leader said ‚Äúall-round mismanagement‚Äù by the Modi government was responsible for the slowdown. ‚ÄúThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 per cent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slow down,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Singh said the country‚Äôs youth, farmers and farm workers, entrepreneurs and the marginalised sections deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path, he said, adding, ‚ÄúI urge the government to put aside vendetta politics, and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds, to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.‚Äù

Singh said it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6 per cent. ‚ÄúThis makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST,‚Äù he said.

The former PM alleged that institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded. On government taking Rs1.76 lakh crore from the RBI reserves, Singh said the resilience of the RBI will be tested after this record transfer to the government.

This, he said, ‚Äúclaims that it (government) does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall.‚Äù Noting that domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18-month low and nominal GDP growth is at a 15 year low, he said, ‚ÄúThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiments are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recover.‚Äù

Blaming Modi government‚Äôs policies for massive job-less growth, he said more than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large-scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting most vulnerable workers, he said. He said rural India is in terrible shape as farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined.

The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their incomes, by inflicting misery on over 50 per cent of India‚Äôs population, he alleged. The former prime minister, a noted economist, said the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

‚ÄúBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase its exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignments. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government,‚Äù he alleged. The scathing attack by the former prime minister comes after the country reported a slow GDP growth rate of 5 per cent for the first quarter of this fiscal.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growth to over six-year low of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2019-20.

Singh‚Äôs prediction of GDP decline post demonestisation was also realised. Widely credited for launching India‚Äôs economic reforms in 1991, Singh had termed Modi government‚Äôs demonetisation move, ‚Äúorganised loot and legalised plunder.‚Äù He had also warned that the drastic step would bring down country‚Äôs GDP growth by 2 per cent, which it did in the following year.",https://www.thestatesman.com/india/all-round-mismanagement-by-the-govt-responsible-for-economic-slowdown-says-former-pm-manmohan-singh-1502794620.html,

Further drawing similarities between Godse and PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi said: ‚ÄúNathuram Godse shot Mahatma Gandhi because he loved no one, cared for nobody and believed in nobody, and that is the same with our Prime Minister, he only loves himself, only believes in himself.‚Äù

Rahul Gandhi remarks regarding Godse comes as India pays tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary.

Underemployment more serious than unemployment: Niti Aayog,"""Severe underemployment"" and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, says the government's policy think tank Niti Aayog.

This assertion comes amid Congress's criticism of the Narendra Modi government over creating lesser jobs.

In its draft three-year action agenda report for 2017-18 to 2019-20, the Niti Aayog stressed on the need for creation of high-productivity and high-wage jobs.

""Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India's problems.

The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment.

A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,"" it said.

The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the Niti Aayog on 23 April.

Contrary to some assertions that India's growth has been jobless, the Employment Unemployment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which till date remain the most reliable sources of information on the country's employment situation, have consistently reported low and stable rates of unemployment over more than three decades, it said.

Citing examples, the Niti Aayog said as per NSSO survey, in 2011-12, 49 per cent of the work force was employed in agriculture but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India's GDP at current prices.

Second in 2010-11, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India's manufacturing workforce but contributed only 12 per cent of manufacturing output, it said.

According to 2006-07 NSSO survey of service firms, the 650 largest enterprises accounted for 38 per cent of services output but only employed two per cent of service workers.

""Put another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the work force but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,"" the report said.

Citing the example of China's ageing work force, the Niti Aayog stressed on attracting big firms working in that country to India which has availability of large workers at competitive wages.

""The experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers.

""The 'Make in India' campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,"" it said.

The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many large-scale firms in labour-intensive sectors currently manufacturing in that country are looking for lower-wage locations.

""With its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,"" the report said.",https://www.thestatesman.com/india/underemployment-more-serious-than-unemployment-niti-aayog-1495967050.html,
BJP led Central govt trying to hide economic slump by data manipulation: Congress,"The Delhi Congress on Saturday started a ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô rally to protest against the BJP-led government at the Centre, calling it responsible for the ‚Äòfinancial ruin‚Äô in the country and saying the Centre was trying to cover up the economic slump through manipulation of data.

The ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô rally continued today as well. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee President Subhash Chopra led the party workers in the rally. They held the the Central government responsible for the large scale unemployment, price rise, the heavy losses suffered by businessmen and industrialists following demonetisation and the resultant economic slump.

The rally saw the participation of the former Union Minister Ajay Maken, Chairman of Campaign Committee Kirti Azad and AICC Secretary Kuljeet Singh Nagra .

Senior Congress leader Maken while addressing the rally said that if the Modi government stated the truth instead of juggling with statistics, the ground reality would be very frightening, as in the first quarter of 2019-20, GDP growth was at an abysmal low of 5 per cent, which was ‚Äúvery shameful‚Äù for the Central government.

‚ÄúThe Modi government is trying to cover up the economic slump through manipulation of data,‚Äù Maken said.

‚ÄúIMF, Fitch, World Bank, Moody‚Äôs and even the Reserve Bank of India have cut India‚Äôs growth forecast,‚Äù he said, adding that India has dropped to the level of 7th largest economy from being the 5th largest in the world.

Labour reforms the antidote to India‚Äôs perpetual job crisis,"The lack of jobs is beginning to haunt the Modi government. The Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs recent Consumer Confidence Survey shows that public perception is also beginning to take account of the fact that there are no jobs available in the economy. According to the survey, 43.7 percent of responders felt that the employment situation had worsened as compared to 31.9 percent a year ago.

The official unemployment numbers, which hover at around five per cent, will never reflect the true picture since in a developing economy, where poverty is high and unemployment benefits are virtually non-existent, no one can afford to remain out of the workforce for long. They usually find employment doing odd jobs or in the agricultural sector.

However, job creation numbers do give a clearer picture. According to the Labour Bureau, the Indian economy was generating around 900,000 jobs in 2010 and 2011. Since then, the jobs created in the economy have consistently fallen, reaching around 135,000 in 2015 as opposed to the need for an annual generation of over 11,00,000 jobs. The situation has not improved since.

However, this is not a recent phenomenon. The Indian economy has never been good at creating jobs. As per popular estimates, including those of the RBI, India‚Äôs employment elasticity, which is a measure of the percentage in employment for a one percent change in economic growth, has been around 0.2 in the post-reform period. This implies that as the real GDP rises by 10 percent, employment will merely rise by two percent. To put things in perspective, International Labour Organisation (ILO ) estimates Brazil‚Äôs employment elasticity to be an impressive 0.9.

This long-term trend shows that there is a structural reason behind this problem. When an economy transitions from agricultural-led to a modern one, it undergoes three key transformations: Movement of labour out of agriculture into industry and then services, shift of workers from informal into the formal sector and finally a rapid pace of urbanisation as more industries are set up in the rural areas around cities.

India has missed the bus on all three of these fronts. Industrial development never took place in India and the economy became service-led right away. Employment in industry and services remains predominantly informal. Consequently, the pace of urbanisation has slowed in India.

Moreover, whatever industrial development has taken place in India has been either capital-intensive or skilled labour-intensive. India‚Äôs labour-capital ratio in a vast majority of industries has been lower than other countries at similar levels of development. The very opposite is needed for job creation in a developing economy. But why has the pace of development been so skewed for India? What is so different about India that made it deviate from the historical trend of structural transformation for economies around the world?

India‚Äôs notoriously rigid labour laws are the leading cause behind these anomalies. Labour falls under the concurrent list of the constitution, which implies that both the Centre and the states can form laws on it and neither has been miserly about this. When combined, each state ends up with over 200 different labour laws. These disincentivise firms from growing beyond a point. For instance, the Trade Unions Act of 1926 requires firms with seven or more workers to form trade unions. The Factories Act of 1948 mandates manufacturing units with 10 or more workers to have several working hour limits and work place conditionalities that become stricter with more workers.

The most burdensome of all is the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947, which covers all industrial disputes and makes it almost impossible for firms with 100 or more workers to fire anyone. Establishments require permission from the labour department to lay anyone off and such permissions are rarely given even if the firm is unprofitable. Therefore, firms with six or less employees have the most labour flexibility.

As expansion of firms comes with high legislative costs in India, it is rational for them to remain small. This is why 84 per cent of manufacturing employment is restricted to micro and small enterprises in stark contrast with other developing countries (46 per cent for South Korea and Thailand, 27 per cent for Malaysia and 25 per cent for China).

India‚Äôs labour laws have inhibited the growth of manufacturing firms, which lose out on the gains they could have made from economies of scale and innovation. Due to these reasons India has not been able to undergo industrial development and is finding it difficult to gain from the rise in labour costs in China. India could have been the next manufacturing hub after China but since there is a sheer lack of capability; countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam have been thriving in labour-intensive sectors like textiles.

Labour reforms are, therefore, the antidote to India‚Äôs perpetual job crisis ‚Äî but this is politically sensitive topic. The Modi government is in a unique position of being capable enough of pushing through such bold reforms since it has the numbers needed for this. However, considering how most of its attempts at reform have backfired, this will be the farthest thing on the government‚Äôs mind. A piecemeal attempt at labour reform with the Small Factories Bill, which aims to exempt factories with 40 workers from 14 labour laws, has been in limbo for the last two years.

However, on a positive note, some state governments are beginning to allow larger firms to retrench workers without seeking permission with their own amendments to IDA. Hopefully, it will not be too late before India manages to extricate itself from this mess of its own creation.",https://www.thestatesman.com/business/labour-reforms-the-antidote-to-indias-perpetual-job-crisis-1502512651.html,
Jobless growth won‚Äôt help India,"As Narendra Modi completes three years as prime minister, he must seriously worry about his government's inability to meet the single biggest promise he had made in his election speeches in 2014 ‚Äì providing jobs to new entrants in India's labour market.

""I can't do much about those in their fifties but I want to transform the lives of those in their twenties who are seeking new employment,"" Modi had said.

Providing gainful employment opportunities is essential for enabling people to improve their standard of living. For a country like India, which has surplus labour and a strong affinity for new technologies, employment generation in the 21st century poses a new challenge. More recently, the sluggish growth of various sectors of the economy, especially post demonetisation, has made this challenge more severe.

According to the labour ministry's 27th Quarterly Employment Survey of eight employment intensive industries -textile, leather, metals, automobile, gems, Transport, IT and handloom & power loom, there were 43,000 job losses in the first quarter of FY 2015-16. The second quarter was somewhat better, with 134,000 new jobs.

During the decade 2001-11, the growth rate of the labour force (2.23 per cent) was significantly higher than the growth rate of employment (1.4 per cent), which itself was several-fold less than the growth rate of the economy.

According to Census 2011, the average growth rate of the economy was 7.7 per cent per annum, when it was only 1.8 per cent for employment.

The trend of a significant gap between the pace of GDP growth and that of employment growth has given rise to the phenomenon of ""jobless growth"" in India. The limited impact of booming growth on employment generation is captured in an indicator called employment elasticity or the rate of change of employment per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

This has been secularly declining in the 2000s from 0.44 from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 to a near-zero level of 0.01 from 2004-05 to 2009-10. The situation has worsened due to weak industrial growth, a struggling agriculture sector with widespread drought, cost rationalizations in several sectors and the knock-on effect of a global slowdown. Also, traditionally labour-intensive industries are beginning to increasingly mechanize their operations.

While it makes them more productive and profitable, it also shrinks job opportunities.

The economy has become less labourabsorbent. In 2015, the government expanded the scope of organised industry from just eight manufacturing sectors to include some key services industries such as education and health. This was clearly done to bump up the employment growth figures because the manufacturing sector was showing a very poor growth trend ‚Äì around 1.5 per cent annually ‚Äì whereas the service sector was doing much better and growing at 7-8 per cent.

Adding service sectors to the organised sector employment data has helped the government show a slight improvement in new jobs growth in 2016. Prima facie, it is difficult to believe that industries were hiring when the economy was paralyzed by notebandi for about four months.

The bulk of the organised industry was busy managing the new situation caused by demonetisation, with a fall in the sales of manufactured items nearly across the board.

Large manufacturers are trimming operations, throwing many jobs into jeopardy. Nokia, locked in a tax dispute with Indian authorities, shut down its factory in Chennai in November 2014, rendering 8,000 workers jobless. Zomato, a food tech company, laid off 300 employees, or 10 per cent of its workforce, last year as the business went through a squeeze. Currently, the manufacturing sector has an overall employment share of 12-13 per cent.

While this share has been growing, the manufacturing sector has been losing people to the services sector, which is seen as more glamorous, better paid and gain international exposure.

Yet, there are some areas that still stand out when it comes to job creation, notably the financial services and the financial technology sectors. Ever since the RBI granted licenses to around 21 banks in 2015, employment opportunities have been growing. The banks have been opening new branches and hiring personnel to augment their services. Similarly the entry of outfits such as PayTM which combine technology with financial services is also giving a new impetus to job creation.

There is a need to understand that there will always be a trade-off between technology and the workforce previously performing that task. Jobless growth will only ensure that the demographic dividend becomes a demographic curse. There are several steps the government would need to take to bring the country out of this jobless growth trap.

One of them is the reform of labour regulations. Labour law reform that encourages greater flexibility while providing a safety net for the unemployed is equally necessary. Rajasthan has set an example through a recent state-level amendment where it raised employment threshold for enforcement of some of the restrictive provisions of the Factories Act and also raised the minimum membership for the registration of a labor union from 15 to 30 per cent of the firm's employment.

Encouraging states to make their own amendments is a step in the right direction. Additionally, the Centre has rightly set up a web portal for the self-filing of compliance reports pertaining to various central labour laws. India also needs to enable its workforce to adapt to the changing skills requirements accompanying technological progress.

Regulation of enterprises is a major factor that affects job creation. Simplification coupled with ""smarter regulations"" is the way to go. Encouraging people's entrepreneurial instincts will generate sustainable outcomes. The government could incentivise job creation by giving infrastructure a push. The credibility of employmentunemployment data needs to be established.

At present, the source used for estimating the employment/unemployment rate in India is NSSO data. However, this data is not available annually. Since 12 million people enter the labour force annually, frequent periodic assessment of the labour market is essential.

"Unemployment rate at 45-year high, confirms Labour Ministry data","The unemployment rate in 2017-18 was 6.1 per cent, corroborating the pre-election leaked report that had claimed joblessness at a 45-year high.

The leaked report on periodic labour force survey (PLFS) from July 2017 to June 2018 had on comparison with previous surveys concluded that the joblessness was at the highest level in 45 years.

However, releasing the survey report after taking into account the expert committee recommendations, Statistics Secretary Pravin Srivastava told reporter, ‚ÄúIt is a new design and a new matrix. It would be unfair to compare it with the past. This 45- year high is your interpretation. I don‚Äôt want to claim that it is 45-year low or high.‚Äù

Elaborating further, he said, ‚ÄúThe point is that it is different matrix. From 2017-18 onwards, you will be getting regular estimates and this (labour force survey) can be used as a base. When we change the matrix, it is very difficult to measure (compare) because there is no means to do a retrospective analysis in that year based on earlier matrix.‚Äù

The data released by the government on a day when ministers of the Narendra Modi cabinet took charge showed 7.8% of all employable urban youth being jobless, while the percentage for the rural was 5.3 %.

The joblessness among males on all-India basis was 6.2%, while it was 5.7% in case of females.

It also showed that the unemployment rate for males was higher at 7.1% in cities compared to 5.8% in rural areas.

Similarly, the joblessness for women was also higher in urban areas at 10.8% compared to 3.8% in rural areas.

The ministry said the PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis. It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen.

Thus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or work force requiring low skills and low remuneration. The PLFS results give the distribution of educated and unemployed persons across the country which can be used as a basis for skilling of youth to make them more employable by industry, it said.

About the National Statistical Commission (NSC), Mr. Srivastava said, ‚ÄúThe NSC makes its recommendation but the ministry has to consider it. They can only make recommendations. The NSC has the role to see statistical system in entirety in addition to statistics ministry and states. There is no change in the functioning of ministry. The restructuring of ministry was approved by the Cabinet.‚Äù

He also informed, ‚ÄúThe data for PLFS for January to March will be released next month. We have brought two quarterly data on labour survey. We are coming out with consumption expenditure survey for 2017-18. We are expecting it in June. You can then compare unemployment captured by that survey with PLFS.‚Äù",https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/unemployment-rate-at-45-year-high-confirms-labour-ministry-data/article27379174.ece,
Karnataka‚Äôs unemployment rate at 4.8% is below national average,"The controversial and much-delayed Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) shows that Karnataka‚Äôs unemployment stands at 4.8% for those above 15 years of age, significantly below the national average of 6%.

Unemployment rates in PLFS, which conducted its surveys in 2017-18, have been under the scanner after a leaked report in January showed that the national unemployment rate was at a 45-year high.

The report, released by Ministry of Statistics, Planning and Implementation, shows that the Unemployment Rate (UR) in Karnataka for usual status (that is, based on work over the year prior to the survey) compares to relatively-industrialised States of Gujarat and Maharashtra (both are 4.8%), but below neighbouring Andhra Pradesh (4.5%). The State is fifth best among large States in terms of low rate of unemployment.

Unemployment is highest in urban areas, following the trend shown in the previous National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)employment reports. In Karnataka, urban unemployment is at 6.3%, compared to rural unemployment of 3.9%. Unemployment rates among females over the age of 15 is the highest at 7.2%.

Similarly, youth unemployment (that is, those without work between the ages of 15 and 29) has touched 15.8% in the State. Though this is higher than Maharashtra and Gujarat, the unemployment rate among youth remains the lowest in South India.

The report shows that as education qualifications increase, so does unemployment rates. For the illiterate, who form nearly a quarter of the State‚Äôs population, the unemployment rate is 0.4%, while for those with diploma or comparable certificates, the unemployment rate is 22.1%. The unemployment rate among graduates and postgraduates is more than 12%.

This is particularly stark in rural Karnataka ‚Äî 35% of those with diploma certification are unemployed, while nearly a quarter of postgraduate degrees are without jobs in rural hinterlands. In contrast, 13.5% of urban diploma holders are unemployed, while barely 1 in 10 postgraduates is unemployed.

Data comparison

The NSSO had surveyed more than 7,600 people from 224 villages in the State between July 2017 to June 2018 for the report that incorporates multiple changes compared to the quinquennial (once in five years) surveys conducted before.

NSSO data from 2011-12 labour survey had shown the State‚Äôs unemployment to be 2.2%. While the PLFS compares data from previous surveys, a release from the Union Government on Friday notes that due to changes in methods of sampling, the PLFS report ‚Äúprovides a new metric for measurement of employment and unemployment‚Äù.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/states-unemployment-rate-at-48-is-below-national-average/article27401820.ece,
The sum and substance of the jobs data,"The report from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) is finally out, garnering a lot of attention based on selective reading of tables and spurring partisan debates. In particular, the staggering increase in the unemployment rate, from 1.7% in 2011-12 to 5.8% in 2017-18 for rural men and from 3.0% to 7.1% for urban men, has generated wide ranging hand-wringing. However, a more nuanced picture emerges if we are to look beyond the partisan debates to policy implications of the data on employment and unemployment. Three takeaway points from these data are of particular policy relevance.

Three pointers

First, while the unemployment rate is a frequently used measure of poor performance of the economy, under conditions of rising school and college enrolment, it paints an inaccurate picture. Second, the reported unemployment rate is dominated by the experience of younger Indians who face higher employment challenges and exhibit greater willingness to wait for the right job than their older peers. Third, the unemployment challenge is greatest for people with secondary or higher education, and rising education levels inflate unemployment challenges. These three conditions, taken together, suggest that part of India‚Äôs unemployment challenge lies in its success in expanding education while not expanding formal sector jobs.

Comparison of male employment and unemployment data from the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO‚Äôs) 68th round Employment survey conducted in 2011-12 and the new PLFS of 2017-18 illustrates each of these points. The unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed by the number in the labour forces, that is, the sum of employed and unemployed. This statistic ignores people who are out of the labour force ‚Äî students, homemakers and the disabled.

Unemployment rate data

As long as the proportion of the population out of the labour force is more or less stable, the unemployment rate is a good indicator of the changes in the employment situation. However, India has seen massive changes in proportion of individuals enrolled in an educational institution over the past decade. For 15-19-year-old rural men, the proportion primarily engaged in studying increased from 64% to 72% between 2011-12 and 2017-18. As a result, while the proportion of the population aged 15-19 that is unemployed doubled from 3% to 6.9%, the unemployment rate tripled from 9% to 27%. Leaving the numerator (proportion of population unemployed) same while the denominator changes by removing students from the labour force can overstate job losses.

The proportion of the population that is unemployed has increased only slightly for population aged 30 and above but increased substantially for younger men. For rural men (30-34), the proportion of unemployed increased from 1% to 2.3% while that for men (20-24) increased from 4.6% to 16.1%. Much of the increase in male unemployment is located among ages 15-29. It is important to recognise that in a country dominated by informal sector work, remaining unemployed is possible only for individuals whose families can survive without their immediate contributions. While a 25-year-old may spend his time diligently applying for a formal sector and be supported by his parents during this period, a 30-year-old with a wife and children may have no option but to take any work available to him, even if it pays poorly and offers little job security.

Finally, the unemployment rate has been traditionally high for men with secondary or higher level of education and this is the segment in which most of the increase in unemployment is located. The unemployment rate for illiterate rural men increased from 0.5 to 1.7 between 2011-12 and 2017-18 but the absolute increase was substantially larger, from 3.8 to 10.5 for rural men with at least secondary education. Similar trends are evident for urban men.

This increase in unemployment for educated youth comes at a time when education has expanded substantially. Among rural men (15-29 years), the population with secondary or higher education increased from 43% to 53% between 2011-12 and 2017-18; in urban areas there was a five percentage point increase, from 61% to 66%.

These three observations taken together suggest that the roots of India‚Äôs present day unemployment challenges lie in its very success. Educational expansion affects the unemployment debate by skewing the unemployment statistics and by creating greater competition for well-paid jobs among a rising population of educated youth. Rising prosperity allows young graduates to wait for well-paying jobs, creating an army of educated unemployed, before being forced to accept any work, frequently returning to family farms or starting small shops.

Recognition of rising unemployment as a function of rising education forces us to grapple with different issues than a simple focus on unemployment statistics. If public policies such as demonetisation are responsible for rising unemployment, we would see across-the-board increase in unemployment for all age groups. That this phenomenon is located mainly among the young and well educated reflects a challenge that goes well beyond the temporary slowdown facing India post-demonetisation.

Meeting aspirations

Modern India is an aspirational society. After decades of economic stagnation, the 21st century has seen massive growth in aspirations. Parents invest their hearts and souls along with their rising incomes in educating their children. Children hope to make rapid economic progress well beyond the modest gains achieved by their parents‚Äô generation. The unemployment statistics based on PLFS data document the challenges these young people are likely to face.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance has returned to power with a mandate that allows it the freedom to focus on key challenges facing modern India. Creating jobs for an increasingly educated workforce and ensuring that the new workers are well equipped to enter the labour force are twin challenges that deserve greatest priority. One hopes that leaders of the present government who made their political debut during the student movement in the 1970s will meet this challenge head-on.

"India's unemployment rate has hit 3-year high, shows CMIE data","India‚Äôs unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, the highest level since August 2016, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Friday.

According to CMIE, the urban unemployment rate for October 2019 stood at 8.9%, slightly higher than the rural unemployment rate of 8.3%.

The chart below shows the unemployment trend since January 2016, when CMIE began estimating unemployment.

Among States, Tripura and Haryana saw unemployment levels of more than 20% (the highest), while the unemployment was the lowest in Tamil Nadu at 1.1%. Rajasthan saw its unemployment rate double between September and October 2019.

The CMIE‚Äôs figures are in line with the findings of the latest Periodic Labour Force Survey, which had estimated an unemployment rate of 6.1% between July 2017 and June 2018, the worst in 45 years.

The data also comes on the back of other indicators showing a downturn in the economy, including the core sector output in September posting its worst contraction in at least 14 years. Earlier, August‚Äôs industrial output shrank at its fastest rate in more than six years.

A working paper titled, 'India‚Äôs Employment Crisis' by researchers at the Centre for Sustainable Employment estimates that between 2011-12 and 2017-18, employment declined by an unprecedented nine million jobs (a 2% drop), with agricultural employment declining by 11.5%.

In the same period, employment in the service sector increased by 13.4%, while manufacturing employment dipped by 5.7%.

The graph below shows the change in employment in absolute numbers across sectors.

The data in the paper also shows that while employment has been declining, those who are ""Not in Labour Force, Education and Training"" has continued to increase -- from about 84 million in 2011-12, it has now crossed 100 million.

Unemployment set to rise marginally,"Unemployment in India is projected to witness marginal increase between 2017 and 2018, signalling stagnation in job creation in the country, according to a UN labour report.

The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) released its 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report on Thursday, which finds economic growth trends lagging behind employment needs and predicts both rising unemployment and worsening social inequality throughout 2017.

Job creation in India is not expected to pick up pace in 2017 and 2018 as unemployment rises slightly, representing a near stagnation in percentage terms.

‚ÄúUnemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7 million last year to 17.8 million in 2017 and 18 million next year. In percentage terms, unemployment rate will remain at 3.4 per cent in 2017-18,‚Äù the report added.

India had performed slightly well in terms of job creation in 2016, when a ‚Äúmajority‚Äù of the 13.4 million new employment created in Southern Asia happened in the country.

The report also acknowledged that India‚Äôs 7.6 per cent growth in 2016 helped Southern Asia achieve 6.8 per cent growth that year.

The report added that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent (from 5.7 per cent in 2016) ‚Äî representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017).

‚ÄúWe are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for millions of new labour market entrants every year,‚Äù said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.

The increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries ‚Äî as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017. The number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 (during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016), it said.

‚ÄúAlmost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,‚Äù said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.

That statistic is even worse for emerging countries.

Those living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing the greatest risk.

In contrast, unemployment is expected to fall in 2017 in developed countries (by 670,000), bringing the rate down to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2016.PTI

Surveying India‚Äôs unemployment numbers,"Monthly measurement of the unemployment rate is one of the requirements of the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The SDDS ‚Äî India was one of the early signatories ‚Äîwas established in 1996 to help countries access the international capital markets by providing adequate economic and financial information publicly. India complies with many requirements of the SDDS, but it has taken an exception with respect to the measurement of unemployment.

The Government of India does not produce any measure of monthly unemployment rate, nor does it have any plans to do so. Official plans to measure unemployment at an annual and quarterly frequency is in a shambles. This does not befit India‚Äôs claims to be the fastest growing economy and as the biggest beneficiary of a famed demographic dividend.

The Centre for Monitoring India Economy (CMIE), a private enterprise, has demonstrated over the past three years that fast frequency measures of unemployment can be made and that seeking an exception on SDDS compliance is unnecessary.

Higher frequency survey

The CMIE decided to fill India‚Äôs gap in generating fast frequency measures of household well-being in 2014. In its household survey, called the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS), the sample size was 172,365 as compared to that of the official National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO), which was 101,724. In both surveys, the sample selection method has been broadly the same.

The CPHS is comprehensive, surveying its entire sample every four months. Each survey is a wave. The CPHS is also a continuous survey, and so, for example, three waves are completed in a year. The CMIE‚Äôs CPHS thus has a much larger sample and is conducted at a much higher frequency than the NSSO‚Äôs.

Further, the CPHS is conducted as face-to-face interviews necessarily using GPS-enabled smartphones or tablets. Intense validation systems ensure high fidelity of data capture. All validations are conducted in real-time while the teams are in the field. The data capture machinery ensures delivery of high quality data in real time obviating the need for any further ‚Äúcleaning‚Äù, post field operations.

Once the data is collected and validated in real-time, it is automatically deployed for estimations without any human intervention.

In 2016, the CMIE added questions regarding employment/unemployment to the CPHS. Since then, the CMIE has been generating labour market indicators regularly and making these freely available for public use (https://bit.ly/2OxLAs4).

A difference between the CPHS and the NSSO surveys is the reference period of the employment status of a respondent. While the NSSO tries to capture the status for an entire year and for a week, the CPHS captures the status as on the day of the survey. This could be as one of four factors: employed; unemployed willing to work and actively looking for a job; unemployed willing to work but not actively looking for a job, and unemployed but neither willing nor looking for a job.

Since the recall period in the CPHS is of the day of the survey (or the immediate preceding day in the case of daily wage labourers) and the classification is elementary, the CPHS has been able to capture the status fairly accurately with no challenges of the respondent‚Äôs ability to recall or interpret the status. In contrast, the NSSO‚Äôs system is quite complex.

The large CPHS sample is distributed evenly across rural and urban regions for every week of the execution cycle of 16 weeks of a wave. It is this machinery that enables us to understand the Indian labour market with fast-frequency measures. So what do these fast-frequency measures tell us?

Key findings

The most important message from the data is that India‚Äôs labour participation rate is very low by world standards and that even this low participation rate fell very sharply after demonetisation. The average labour participation rate was 47% during January-October 2016. The world average is about 66%.

Immediately after demonetisation in November 2016, India‚Äôs labour participation rate fell to 45%; 2% of the working age population, i.e. about 13 million, moved out of labour markets. That is a lot of people who were willing to work who decided that they did not want to work any more.

The data show that it was not the employed who lost jobs and decided to stop working. The employed mostly retained their jobs. But it was largely the unemployed who decided that the labour markets had been so badly vitiated after demonetisation that they gave up looking for jobs any further. In short, they lost hope of finding jobs in the aftermath of demonetisation.

As more and more unemployed left the labour market, the unemployment rate fell. This is because the unemployment rate is the ratio of the unemployed to the total labour force. This fall gave misleading or at least confusing signals, almost implying that the unemployment rate was falling in a positive sense. In reality it was a reflection of an exodus of the unemployed from the labour markets ‚Äî a fall in the labour participation rate. And this underlines the much greater importance of the labour participation rate.

On female labour

Specifically, India‚Äôs female labour participation rate is very low. Official statistics have always shown that India‚Äôs female labour participation rate is low and falling. Researchers have shown that this fall is because of rising household incomes that reduce the need for women to join the labour force; increased enrolment in higher education by women which delays their entry into the labour force, and cultural and security factors that keep women away from the labour market in India. Further, it is evident that employers are also biased against hiring women.

The CPHS shows that the situation with respect to women‚Äôs participation in the labour force is extremely poor ‚Äî much poorer than what the official agencies tell us. The entire brunt of demonetisation was borne by women. Their labour participation fell sharply while that of men did not.

After the demonetisation jolt came the Goods and Services Tax shock of July 2017 that drove away small enterprises which could not compete in a tax-compliant environment out of business. This caused a substantial loss of jobs. Preliminary estimates suggest that employment shrunk by 11 million in 2018. The brunt of this was again borne largely by women. But men too were also impacted.

Male labour participation rate was 74.5% in 2016. This dropped to 72.4% in 2017 and then to 71.7% in 2018. In contrast, female labour participation was as low as 15.5% in 2016 which dropped to 11.9% in 2017 and then 11% in 2018. Urban female labour participation rates fell faster than rural female participation. In urban India it dropped from 15.2% in 2016 to 10.5% in 2018. The corresponding values for rural women were 15.6% and 11.3%, respectively.

Although female labour participation is substantially much lower than male participation, the few women who venture to get employment find it much more difficult to find jobs than men. The unemployment rate for men was 4.9% in 2018 and that for women in the same year was much higher ‚Äî 14.9%.

This higher unemployment rate faced by women in spite of a very low participation rate indicates a bias against employing women. Drawing women into the labour force by removing the impediments they face to at least bring their participation levels close to global standards is critically important for India to gain from the demographic dividend opportunity it has. This window of opportunity is open only till 2030. By not using a good data monitoring machinery, the Indian government is keeping both itself and the citizenry in the dark.

Is the unemployment crisis for real?,"Yes | Mahesh Vyas

Employment opportunities, formal jobs and the labour force are all shrinking

The jobs situation in India does not reflect a crisis, but it is a matter of serious concern. A crisis is understood as an emergency that demands immediate attention, without which we could see a calamity of sorts. There is no immediate calamity of any kind on hand. But there is a deeply insidious problem at work in the form of shrinking employment opportunities, shrinking formal jobs, and a shrinking labour force.

A populous and demographically young country like India has a lot to gain if the expanding working-age population can join the labour force and be provided with gainful employment. More hands at work can ensure greater prosperity and relatively evenly spread growth.

Problems of unemployment

But if India cannot provide employment to its growing working-age population, it does not just miss a chance to become a prosperous country, but also risks becoming an unmanageable or unruly country. Unemployed youth, beyond a threshold, can lose hope of a job and can easily stray into becoming unsocial elements.

A bigger problem is that those who do get jobs and prosper do not appreciate the plight of those who do not. It is mistakenly believed that those who do not get good jobs are not worthy of getting them. The blame is placed at the door of the unemployed as if it is entirely their problem. The macro-economic and social dimension of the problem is not appreciated in India.

Statistics give us clues of the brewing problem and its insidious nature. First, we are in the midst of a serious investments deficit. CMIE‚Äôs CapEx database demonstrates the persistent fall in new investment proposals since 2011-12. New investment proposals had peaked at ‚Çπ25 trillion in 2010-11. In 2017-18, these were down to ‚Çπ11 trillion, and in 2018-19, these are unlikely to cross ‚Çπ10 trillion.

The impact of this fall in investments is visible in shrinking jobs. In a point-to-point comparison, in 2018, the number of persons employed declined by 11 million. An estimated 408 million people were employed in December 2017. This fell to 397 million in December 2018. The average employment in 2017 was 406.5 million. This fell to an average of 402.1 million in 2018. This shows a smaller fall of 4.5 million. Either way, we see a very substantial fall in employment. One (11 million) is only much worse than a fairly bad fall of 4.5 million, or 10%.

Labour participation rate

This fall in jobs is not translating into a proportionate rise in unemployment. But it is showing up in a fall in the labour participation rate. A rise in unemployment is bad, but a fall in the labour participation rate is worse. The former reflects a shortage of jobs compared to the number of people looking for jobs. The latter reflects a fall in the number of people looking for jobs. When we juxtapose this against falling jobs, we see a glimpse of the hopelessness of people who should be looking for jobs.

Our real crisis is in the nature of the government‚Äôs response to the situation. When the establishment works hard to rubbish sound statistical practices and results of large sample household surveys and instead uses back-of-the-envelope calculations to measure employment, we are headed towards a bigger crisis than the jobs crisis.

The methodology used in the surveys is questionable. What India has is a wage problem

The furore around the unemployment issue is ill-founded. Most of the analysis is based on incomplete representations of the labour market. The recent surveys that profess spiralling unemployment are either unverifiable or heavily skewed by sampling biases. This narrative raises questions on the political motivations behind these surveys that may intend to change the perception of India‚Äôs growth trajectory, nationally and globally.

What the surveys ignore

CMIE claimed that the total working population in India declined by 11 million (1.1 crore) in 2018. These preliminary estimates seem opportunistically quoted by the think tank two months ahead of schedule. CMIE has considered a minuscule sample of 1,40,000 respondents for a nation of more than 1.3 billion citizens. With regards to the leaked excerpts of the National Sample Survey Office survey, the public has been unduly kept in the dark about the methodology used to compute the claimed 6.1% unemployment rate.

Estimating a macro profile of employment for the country based on a survey of even 2 million participants is not statistically valid without a study of the various components of job creation. Such surveys have biased weights which have recently been contradicted by more concrete research. These surveys give higher weight to States with large populations but where less formal jobs are being created. There is a higher supply of formal jobs in Maharashtra and in south India than in States like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Another trend which was noticed was that jobs were being created in big cities. However, cities carry less weight in the aforementioned surveys. A company called BetterPlace Safety Solutions, which has one of the deepest databases of the formal sector workforce in India, had recently released these revelatory migration trends. Until such biases are removed using actual data, we must reserve judgment.

Creation of formal jobs

India has been creating formal jobs in large numbers. Further, deliberations based on other proxy databases like vehicle sales, the annual reports of the IT department, and MUDRA loan disbursals help ascertain jobs in large job-creating markets like transport, the professional sector, and small-scale entrepreneurship, respectively. This provides us with a robust methodology of ascertaining employment.

We have estimated that India requires around 1.5 crore jobs a year. This is because it has got about 2.5 crore people attaining the age of 21 every year. We estimate that 40% of this population may not want formal jobs, as they choose agriculture or become homemakers after marriage. The social security databases point to around 70 lakh jobs created annually (in companies with over 20 employees), the transport sector creates around 30-35 lakh jobs, and the professional sector creates around 6-10 lakh jobs. That‚Äôs 1.1 crore jobs from just three sources. The rest (30-40 lakh jobs) is contributed by people starting their own ventures. India has not improved on its Ease of Doing Business ranking for nothing, and this sector is expected to generate more employment with support from initiatives like Make in India.

Today, if you talk to employers like shopkeepers and small and large firms, they will tell you that they are not finding enough employees. This means that there are not enough skilled people in the market. Manish Sabharwal of TeamLease has been producing an annual labour report documenting a healthy demand for jobs. However, these jobs provide insufficient compensation for the applicants. India has a wage problem and not a job problem. This problem can only be solved by creating higher-quality jobs to meet aspirations.

The issue that is more pressing than unemployment is underemployment

Work is fundamental in determining one‚Äôs quality of life. Indians rely on their jobs to earn a living, to fulfil family obligations, and to satisfy the aspirations that motivate them daily. Yet jobs that are productive, with fair pay, and that allow citizens to live healthy lives are scarce, and are becoming even more so.

Waiting for a good job

Leaked data from the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) latest labour force survey suggests that unemployment rose to an all-time high of 6.1% last year. This is, no doubt, a worrying trend.

Yet the rise in unemployment can largely be explained by the fact that more young people are obtaining an education. With education comes the expectation of a ‚Äòbetter‚Äô job. Those who can afford education also tend to be in a position to wait for a job that meets their requirements. Those who are not as financially fortunate must find the means to make a living, however poor in quality the work may be. The data show that unemployment is higher among the educated, and lower among those with less financial means and education.

The need to work to make ends meet also fuels India‚Äôs large informal economy. Over 90% of the employed (farm and non-farm) are informal workers. In the non-farm sector, 66% of those employed are informal workers. The informal economy is characterised by low levels of productivity and low wages because many of these workers are underemployed.

The urgent crisis confronting the economy, then, is underemployment. Underemployment occurs when workers are unable to find employment that makes use of their qualifications and skills. For instance, an engineer might be working in a mechanic shop. Underemployment and/or refers to the sharing of low-productivity work, as is common in agriculture, for example. Or picture a 16-year-old who spends his mornings selling just enough coconuts to make the bare minimum to survive. And these are just examples of visible underemployment.

Persistent underemployment also contributes to the decline in labour force participation rates. As people grow frustrated with their inability to find a good job, they may stop looking for work and drop out of the labour force altogether. Data from the leaked NSSO labour force survey suggest that the labour force participation rate declined to 49.8% in 2017-18 from 55.9% in 2011-12.

Both underemployment and this form of discouragement are a significant loss of productive potential. This is particularly troubling when it pertains to India‚Äôs large and growing youth population. Pathways to productive and high-quality employment are essential to deliver better living standards to citizens, but also for sustainable and inclusive economic growth.

Three-pronged strategy

So, how can we address the problem? Addressing the underemployment crisis entails a three-pronged strategy.

First, we must improve the quality of jobs by improving productivity in agriculture and in enterprises. Second, we must align education, technical and vocational education and training to market demand. Third, we must make enduring and long-term investments in human capital through good-quality education, skills, and on-the-job training, as well as in basic social protection.

Recent data do suggest that there is rising unemployment. To be sure, this is a problem. But perhaps the larger and arguably more pressing challenge is underemployment.

"Christians most educated, but highest unemployment rate: Survey","The unemployment rate in urban areas reduced from 4.5 per cent in 2004-05 to 3.4 per cent in 2011-12, new data from the National Sample Survey Office show. In rural areas, the rate has been stable at around 1.7 per cent during this period.

According to the survey, which was conducted in 2011-12 and released on Friday, the unemployment rate across all the religious groups in rural areas was on the lower side than those in urban areas for both males and females. Unemployment rate is defined as the number of persons unemployed as a proportion of the labour force (persons who are either ‚Äòworking‚Äô or ‚Äòseeking or available for work‚Äô), not the total population.

Christians have the highest rate of unemployment in both rural (4.5 per cent) and urban (5.9 per cent) areas in 2011-12. The rate in urban areas for Christians stood at 8.6 per cent in 2004-05 while the rural rate stays constant.

Speaking to The Hindu, Alakh Sharma, Director of Institute of Human Development, said: ‚ÄúUnemployment level in India is highest among those people who are richer and more educated. The reason is that poor people can‚Äôt afford to stay unemployed, and hence, opt for any kind of work, irrespective of the nature of the job. The better off have the capacity to be unemployed as they look for the right job. Christians are the most educated group, hence unemployment rate is higher among them.‚Äù Data from the report supports the claim. ‚Äò

Among the persons of age 15 and above, the proportion of people who are not literates was the lowest for Christians. Also, the proportion of persons with educational level secondary and above is highest for Christians.

While the unemployment rate in rural areas has decreased for Sikhs (from 3.5 to 1.3 per cent) ‚Äî now the lowest across all religious groups ‚Äî it has slightly increased for Muslims (from 2.3 to 2.6 per cent). At 3.3 per cent, Hindus have the lowest unemployment rate in urban areas.

Casual labour



Self-employment is the major source of income for almost half the households, across all religious groups, in rural areas, followed by casual labour.

In urban areas, the proportion of households deriving major income from regular wage or salary earnings is the highest. Half the Muslim households in urban areas have self-employment as major source of income, the highest among all religions, while regular wage or salary earnings was the highest for Christians with 45.8 per cent households.

Sudden spike from 2011-12

Unemployment among urban women saw the steepest climb (Over 5 percentage points), while the unemployment rate among urban and rural men rose by 4 percentage points

Education doesn't mean jobs

Across all demographics (urban and rural women and men), those who had finished secondary school and above had the highest rate of unemployment. This was particularly pronounced among urban women (about 20%).

Traditionally, people who finish secondary education and above constitute the largest section of unemployed people, going by past surveys. However, the gap between this section and others was much wider in 2017-18.

IT, electronics boom

About 20% of those who had received some formal vocational/technical training were trained in IT-related disciplines, while electrical and electronics came next.

Just over half employed

Only about 5-6 persons out of 10 who had received formal vocational/technical training were employed. About 3 out of 10 people were not in the labour force during the survey.

The government‚Äôs failure to release the NSSO report was the latest sign of a complete lack of transparency regarding jobs data, they said.

‚ÄúThe NSSO findings are not surprising, but they are alarming. The trends of rising unemployment were already visible. Our analysis showed it was higher in 2015 than in 2011-12, and we expected demonetisation to have a harsh effect,‚Äù said Amit Basole, head of the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University in Bengaluru, and lead author of a report, ‚ÄúState of Working India, 2018‚Äù.

Data confusion

Dr. Basole noted that the government‚Äôs decision to discontinue the NSSO‚Äôs five year surveys, failure to regularly release Labour Bureau data and delay in releasing the NSSO‚Äôs periodic labour force survey had led to ‚Äúan atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion. Instead, the government kept citing job numbers based on EPFO‚Äôs payroll data and the Mudra loans, which are not helpful,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThe data, as cited by the news report, shows that there has been a rise in unemployment and a decline in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) post demonetisation, which is in line with what we have also been saying,‚Äù said Mahesh Vyas, chief executive and managing director of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which has done its own unemployment surveys.

‚ÄúThe LFPR is a measure of people looking for jobs. So, if this is declining while unemployment is growing, it means that there is a very real and serious crisis in jobs. The government has to make the data public as soon as possible,‚Äù added Anamitra Roy Chowdhury, a labour economist with the Centre for Informal Sector & Labour Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Jobless growth becomes more systemic,"The findings of the latest employment survey, called the Periodic Labour Force Survey (2017-18), are a cause for concern as the scenario is still far from anything that would denote decent employment. The two biggest issues here are: the shrinking share of the labour force; and the rising unemployment.

The labour force participation rate (% of people working or seeking work in the above-15 years age category) in the earlier survey of 2012 was 55.5%. This has shrunk to 49.7% in 2018. There is an absolute decline in the number of workers from 467.7 million in 2012 to 461.5 million in 2018.

Multiple dimensions

Recent attempts by some to create an impression that self-employment has not been captured by the National Sample Survey is absolutely false since the definition of ‚Äòemployment‚Äô includes in itself ‚Äòself-‚Äô as well as ‚Äòwage employment‚Äô. Within the category of ‚Äòself-employed‚Äô, the survey also counts those engaged in ‚Äòunpaid family labour‚Äô.

Also Read Can the government help create jobs?

The figure for the overall unemployment rate at 6.1% is 2.77 times the same figure for 2012. A few experts have raised doubts about comparability of estimates between the two periods though we feel that they are not substantial issues that prevent anyone from a judicious comparison.

The rise in overall unemployment has both locational and gender dimensions. The highest unemployment rate of a severe nature was among the urban women at 10.8%; followed by urban men at 7.1%; rural men at 5.8%; and rural women at 3.8%.

When we ignore the location of residence, we find that severe unemployment among men at 6.2% was higher than among women at 5.7%. However, given the sharp decline in women‚Äôs labour force participation rate, they have been losing out heavily due to the double whammy of exclusion from the labour force and an inability to access employment when included in the labour force. The decline in women‚Äôs labour force participation from 31% to 24% means that India is among the countries with the lowest participation of women in the labour force.

The issue of educated unemployment, given its link with not just growth but also with transformative development, has never been as acute as at present. Defined as unemployment among those with at least a secondary school certificate, it is at 11.4% compared to the previous survey‚Äôs figure of 4.9%.

Also Read The sum and substance of the jobs data

But what is significant is that the unemployment rates go up as levels of education go up. Among those with secondary school education, it is 5.7% but jumps to 10.3% when those with higher secondary-level education are considered.

The highest rate is among the diploma and certificate holders (19.8%); followed by graduates (17.2); and postgraduates (14.6%).

Of course, educated persons are likely to have aspirations for specific jobs and hence likely to go through a longer waiting period than their less-educated counterparts. They are also likely to be less economically deprived. But the country‚Äôs inability to absorb the educated into gainful employment is indeed an economic loss and a demoralising experience both for the unemployed and those enthusiastically enrolling themselves for higher education.

Burden more among women

Here again, the burden is the highest among urban women (19.8%) followed by rural women (17.3%), rural men (10.5%) and urban men (9.2%). Among the educated, women face a more unfavourable situation than men despite a low labour force participation rate. Compared to the earlier 2012 survey, unemployment of educated men has more than doubled in both rural and urban areas and in the case of women, the rate has nearly doubled. However, it is important to remember is that the rate was higher for educated women, when compared to educated men, in both the periods.

It is almost scandalous that youth unemployment rate (unemployment among those in the 15-29 years age category) has reached a high 17.8%. Even here, the women stand more disadvantaged than the men, especially urban women, whose unemployment rate of 27.2% is more than double the 2012 figure of 13.1%. The rate for urban men, at 18.7%, is particularly high as well.

The overall conclusion here is that the trend of ‚Äòjobless growth‚Äô that was till recently confined largely, if not only, to the organised sector has now spread to other sectors of the economy, making it more generalised. This calls for a thorough re-examination of the missing linkages between growth and employment.

Congress to create a ‚ÄòNational Register of the Unemployed‚Äô,"The youth wing of the Congress on Thursday launched a nationwide campaign to prepare a National Register of Unemployed (NRU) to highlight rising unemployment and demand answers from the government about the steps it was taking to address the issue.

‚ÄúThe IYC will reach out to every unemployed person. To prepare the data base, a phone number (8151994411) has been circulated on which one can give a missed call,‚Äù Mr. Allavaru said.

Congress leaders said the NRU is also an attempt to keep the focus on ‚Äòreal issues‚Äô and not allow the BJP to change the narrative into a polarizing one.

The shape of the jobs crisis,"Job creation has slowed since 2011-12, the year of the last published National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) labour force survey. I used Labour Bureau annual survey (2015-16) data and Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt. Ltd. (CMIE) data (post-2016), which has a sample size larger than the NSSO labour force surveys, to reach this conclusion. Both surveys cover rural and urban, and organised and unorganised sector employment; in other words, they capture both the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation/National Pension Scheme (organised) as well as such employment as might be generated by Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency Ltd (MUDRA) loans or platform economy jobs. The latter two job sources are precisely what the government claims were not being captured by jobs data available. We have repeatedly stated that government claims on absence of ‚Äògood‚Äô data on jobs are simply untenable.

My analysis prior to the leak of NSSO 2017-18 data had shown that the jobs situation has turned grim since 2012.

A jump now

What the leaked NSSO 2017-18 data have shown is that while the open unemployment rate (which does not measure disguised unemployment and informal poor quality jobs that abound in the economy) by the usual status never went over 2.6% between 1977-78 and 2011-12, it has now jumped to 6.1% in 2017-18. This was expected. In the last 10-12 years, more young people have become educated. The tertiary education enrolment rate (for those in the 18-23 age group) rose from 11% in 2006 to 26% in 2016. The gross secondary (classes 9-10) enrolment rate for those in the 15-16 age groupshot up from 58% in 2010 to 90% in 2016. The expectation of such youth is for a urban, regular job in either industry or services, not in agriculture. If they have the financial wherewithal to obtain education up to such levels, they can also ‚Äúafford‚Äù to remain unemployed. Poor people, who are also much more poorly educated, have a much lower capacity to withstand open unemployment, and hence have lower open unemployment rates.

What NSSO 2017-18 also shows is that as open unemployment rates increased, more and more people got disheartened and fell out of the labour force; in other words, they stopped looking for work. The result is that labour force participation rates (LFPR, i.e. those looking for work) for all ages, fell sharply from 43% in 2004-5 to 39.5% in 2011-12, to 36.9% in 2017-18 (a reflection mainly though not only of the falling female LFPR). This shows up in the growing numbers of youth who are NEETs: not in education, employment or training. They are a potential source of both our demographic dividend but also what is looking to be a mounting demographic disaster.

Meanwhile, government economists have repeatedly told us that there is no jobs crisis.

Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, as many as 7.5 million new non-agricultural jobs were being created every year. The unemployment rate was only 2.2%. The volume of open unemployment was almost constant (at around 10 million) until 2011-12, but it increased to 16.5 million by 2015-16. Increased open unemployment, post 2011-12, suggests that those in education prior to 2011-12 would start searching for non-agricultural jobs but did not find them. The latest NSSO data suggest that this situation had worsened further by 2017-18.

Across education categories

A sharp increase in the unemployment rate of the educated (based on our estimates of the Annual Survey, Labour Bureau) should have worried the government. My estimate is that the unemployment rate rose over 2011-12 to 2016 from 0.6% to 2.4% for those with middle education (class 8); 1.3% to 3.2% for those who had passed class 10; 2% to 4.4% for those who had passed class 12; 4.1% to 8.4% for graduates; and 5.3% to 8.5% for post-graduates. Even more worrying, for those with technical education, the unemployment rate rose for graduates from 6.9% to 11%, for post-graduates from 5.7% to 7.7%, and for the vocationally trained from 4.9% to 7.9%.

While NSSO 2017-18 data show the share of regular wage jobs rising, especially in urban areas (and the share of self-employed and casual wage work falling), this rise in nowhere close to the number of educated youth entering the labour force.

For an economy at India‚Äôs stage of development, an increase of workers in agriculture (of 20 million that took place over 1999-2004) is a structural retrogression, in a direction opposite to the desired one. Between 2004-5 and 2011-12, the number of workers in agriculture fell sharply, which is good, for the first time in India‚Äôs economic history. Similarly, the number of youth (15-29 years) employed in agriculture fell from 86.8 million to 60.9 million (or at the rate of 3 million per annum) between 2004-5 and 2011-12. However, after 2012, as non-agricultural job growth slowed, the number of youth in agriculture actually increased to 84.8 million till 2015-16 and even more since then (as the CMIE data would attest). These youth were better educated than the earlier cohort, but were forced to be in agriculture.

Drop in manufacturing jobs

Even worse, manufacturing jobs actually fell in absolute terms, from 58.9 million in 2011-12 to 48.3 million in 2015-16, a whopping 10.6 million over a four-year period. This is consistent with slowing growth in the Index of Industrial Production (IIP), which consists of manufacturing, mining, and electricity. The IIP had sharply risen from 100 in 2004-5 to 172 by 2013-14 (in the 2004-5 series), but only rose from a base of 100 in 2011-12 in the later series to 107 in 2013-14, and to 125.3 in 2017-18. This is also consistent with exports first falling after 2013, then barely recovering to levels still lower than 2013. It is also consistent with investment-to-GDP ratio falling sharply since 2013, and still remaining well below 2013 levels. This holds for both private and public investment.

What is tragic is the growing number of educated youth (15-29 years) who are ‚ÄúNEET‚Äù. This number (70 million in 2004-5) increased by 2 million per annum during 2004-5 and 2011-12, but grew by about 5 million per annum (2011-12 to 2015-16). If that later trend continued (as there is evidence it has) we estimate it would have increased to 115.6 million in 2017-18. That is a 32 million increase in ‚ÄúNEETs‚Äù in our society over 2011-12 to 2017-18 ‚Äî potential lumpen fodder.

These youth (‚ÄúNEET‚Äù and unemployed) together constitute the potential labour force, which can be utilised to realise the demographic dividend in India. Will a new government at least recognise there is a crisis?

I estimate that the number of new entrants into the labour force (currently at least 5 million per annum), and especially educated entrants into the labour force will go on increasing until 2030. It will thereafter still increase, though at a decelerating pace. By 2040 our demographic dividend ‚Äî which comes but once in the lifetime of a nation ‚Äî will be over. China managed to reduce poverty sharply by designing an employment strategy (underpinned by an education and skills policy) aligned to its industrial strategy. That is why it rode the wave of its demographic dividend. Unfortunately, India has neither an industrial policy nor an employment strategy, let alone the two being aligned.

Is our political class listening? Or are our educated unemployed and NEETs meant to be merely used as political fodder? That is the trillion rupee question for the fastest growing large economy in the world, about to become the fifth largest in the world.

Creating jobs for young India,"Amartya Sen had once quipped that India‚Äôs unemployment figures were low enough to put many developed countries to shame. Professor Sen was, of course, not commending the country‚Äôs record in employment creation, but instead, highlighting the difficulties involved in measuring employment and unemployment in a developing country.

Unemployment has been at the centre of public debates in India recently. The government‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey carried out in 2017-18 revealed that unemployment in the country reached an all-time high rate of 6.1%. What explains this sudden jump in unemployment in India, which had remained at a rather low rate of around 2% for several decades?

Our estimates based on official employment surveys and the Census show that in 2018, there were 471.5 million persons employed and 30.9 million unemployed in India. At the heart of the unemployment problem in India were young, unemployed men aged 15 to 29 years who comprised 21.1 million or 68.3% of all the unemployed in the country. To understand how their numbers rose recently, we need to examine the behaviour of not just labour demand but also labour supply over time.

Rising numbers of job seekers

First, the size of labour supply in India is getting a boost from the rapid expansion of the working-age population in the country ‚Äî the population of 15-59-year-olds increased at the rate of 14 million a year in the 2000s.

Second, the nature of labour supply is changing too, with increasing enrolment of young adults for education and their rising job aspirations. Of all 15-29-year-old females in India, 31% had been attending schools or colleges in 2018, up from 16.3% in 2005 (although, it needs to be mentioned here that there have been questions on the quality of education received and skills acquired by these young people).

Third, the size of the workforce engaged in agriculture (and allied activities) has been declining in India: from 258.8 million in 2005 to 197.3 million in 2018 (which still accounted for 41.9% of the total workforce in the country). This decline has been partly due to the ‚Äòpush‚Äô from low-productivity agriculture, which has suffered due to stagnant public investment from the 1990s onwards. The decline has also been driven by the ‚Äòpull‚Äô of new opportunities that emerge in the towns and cities. A significant number of people who are ‚Äòemployed‚Äô according to official statistics could actually have been in ‚Äòdisguised unemployment‚Äô in agriculture (consider a person who does no job but occasionally assists his family in cultivation). Young persons in rural areas will be increasingly keen to exit disguised unemployment in agriculture.

As a result of the above-referred factors, there has been a significant increase in India in the supply of potential workers for the non-agricultural sectors. These are 15-59-year-olds who are not students nor engaged in agriculture. If provided the relevant skills, they could possibly work in industry, construction and services. Our estimates show that the potential non-agricultural workforce in India grew at the rate of 14.2 million a year between 2005 and 2012, which rose further to 17.5 million a year between 2012 and 2018.

How has the growth of labour demand matched up to the job challenge in India? Between 2005 and 2012, construction had been the major source of employment in India, absorbing men who exited agriculture in rural areas, especially in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The growth of construction jobs was associated with a revival in agricultural incomes and rural wages during this period.

Labour demand lagging behind

However, the growth of agricultural incomes and the rural economy in India slowed down markedly after 2012. New employment opportunities in construction created in rural India amounted to 18.9 million between 2005 and 2012, which fell sharply to 1.6 million between 2012 and 2018. The size of the manufacturing workforce in India declined by one million between 2012 and 2018, with micro and small firms in the informal sector suffering severe setbacks. At the same time, some segments of the services sector, especially education and professional, business and allied services recorded acceleration in employment growth after 2012. The crisis in the rural economy appears to have been moderated to some extent by an increase in governmental spending in 2016-18.

Even from 2005 to 2012, job creation in industry, construction and services in India (at the rate of 6.3 million a year) was inadequate to absorb the increase in potential job seekers into these sectors (at the rate of 14.2 million a year). Between 2012 and 2018, while the supply of potential workers into the non-agricultural sectors accelerated (to 17.5 million a year), actual labour absorption into these sectors decelerated (to 4.5 million a year). Thus, the mismatch between potential supply of and demand for labour deepened after 2012. While only the women suffered due to the mismatch during 2005-2012, young men were also affected after 2012. In fact, 30-59-year-old men managed to secure 90.4% of all new non-agricultural employment opportunities that emerged in India between 2012 and 2018, leaving too few new jobs for women and younger men.

Faced with the inadequate number of new jobs generated in the economy, women withdrew altogether from the labour market. Of all 15-59-year-old women in India, only 23% were employed in 2018, down from 42.8% in 2005. Correspondingly, there had been a sharp rise in the proportion of women who reported their status as attending to domestic duties in their own households. At the same time, the response of young men to the slow job growth in the economy was to continue in the labour market as job seekers. Among 15-29-year-old men, there was an unprecedented increase in the number of the unemployed, from 6.7 million in 2012 to 21.1 million in 2018. This was indeed the main contributor to the sudden increase in overall unemployment in India.

India faces a tough challenge in creating decent jobs for its growing young population. To tackle this, action will be needed on multiple fronts including investments in human capital, revival of the productive sectors, and programmes to stimulate small entrepreneurship. If the country is unable to make effective use of the strengths of its young women and men now, it can perhaps never do so. Within the next two decades or so, India‚Äôs population will gradually start getting older, and it will be tragic for millions of poor Indians to grow old before getting even moderately rich.

Unemployment data based on draft report: NITI Aayog,"The government‚Äôs think tank NITI Aayog on Thursday debunked claims of a news report that unemployment in 2017-18 was at a 45-year high. The NITI Aayog said the report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), cited as the source for the report, was in fact a draft and not approved by the government.

‚ÄúThis is a draft report,‚Äù NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said at a press conference. ‚ÄúWe need to publish data on a quarterly basis. The July 2017-December 2018 data has just been received. Therefore, we don‚Äôt know the data or the veracity of the data. Citing this data or comparing it with the 2011-12 data will not be correct.‚Äù

Mirrors 1972

A report in the Business Standard on Thursday, which cited the NSSO‚Äôs periodic labour force survey ‚Äî that is yet to be released ‚Äî said the unemployment rate was 6.1% in 2017-18. The only year of comparable data when the unemployment rate was higher was in 1972-73. It was at 2.2% in 2011-12.

The NSSO report is a matter of much controversy, with the two external members of the National Statistical Commission citing the delay in its release as a major reason for their resignations on Monday.

The data reportedly showed that joblessness was higher in urban India (7.8%) than in rural India (5.3%). Within this, it stood at 17.4% for rural males and 13.6% for rural females. In urban India, joblessness was at 18.7% among males and a huge 27.2% among females.

Importantly, the data reportedly showed that the labour force participation rate (LFPR), the measure of people working or looking for jobs, declined from 39.5% in 2011-12 to 36.9% in 2017-18. This phenomenon ‚Äî of unemployment rising while the LFPR dipped ‚Äî is a cause for serious worry, experts say, explaining that it probably shows that people are simply giving up on finding jobs and have stopped seeking work.

‚ÄòPeople leaving low quality jobs‚Äô

CEO of NITI Aayog and ex-officio member of the National Statistical Commission Amitabh Kant on Thrusday said, ‚ÄúNearly 7.8 million jobs have been created. We have to take into account people leaving the low quality jobs. We are creating adequate number of jobs for new entrants. The problem seems to be the quality of jobs.‚Äù

‚ÄúIndia needs about seven million jobs and enough jobs have been created for new entrants,‚Äù

Mr Kant was speaking at a press conference in response to a news report in the Business Standard which cited data from the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) of unemployment being at a 45-year high.

Vice-Chairman of the NITI Aayog Rajiv Kumar said the government in fact had evidence of increasing job creation. Stating that the NSSO report was only a draft that had not been approved by the government, he said: ‚ÄúThe government will approve the report which has not been finalised yet. The reason for the delay is it was felt that there were other quarters of data to be made available.‚Äù

Unemployed graduates caught peddling drugs worth Rs. 50 lakh,"After failing to get jobs, three science graduates along with their friend took to peddling drugs to earn a living.

A team from the narcotics wing of the Central Crime Branch on Friday arrested the unemployed youth and recovered seven kg of marijuana, 70 strips of LSD and 13 kg of hashish oil worth Rs. 50 lakh from them.

The accused are Harikrishnan and Harishankar who are residents of Avalahalli; Mohammed Fibin from K.R. Puram and Rahul who resides in Electronics City. All of them are from Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala. They came to Bengaluru for studies.

According to Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Sandeep Patil, Harikrishnan had a degree in automobile engineering while Rahul has an MSc. in computer science. Harishankar had finished his BSc. in computer science and Fibin is a pre-university drop out.

‚ÄúThe accused had finished studies a year ago but were unable to get jobs. They began to peddle drugs,‚Äù said a senior police officer. Their clients were mainly students from reputed colleges across the city and those working in the IT sector.

The accused allegedly sourced the drugs from a contact in Andhra Pradesh. They arranged for the consignments to be brought to Bengaluru through private buses and trains once a fortnight.

The police recovered five mobile phones from the accused. ‚ÄúEfforts are on to track down the buyers to ascertain the magnitude of their network. Though the four youth have been dealing with drugs for a year, this is the first time they were caught,‚Äù Mr. Patil said.

How they were caught

CCB police chanced upon the gang while following up on a lead. An undercover team placed an order with them and arranged to take delivery at Bhattarahalli signal. The accused were caught red-handed, said a police officer. He added that the hashish oil bottles were disguised to make them appear like they were honey.

Maharashtra‚Äôs economy to grow at 5.7%,"Maharashtra‚Äôs economy is expected to grow at 5.7% in 2019-20 compared to 5% the previous fiscal, according to the Economic Survey presented in the Assembly on Thursday. The State budget will be presented on Friday.

The 0.7% rise in the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) is attributed to the growth in agriculture and allied activities at 3.1% compared to (-)2.2% the previous fiscal. However, the growth in the industry sector has dipped to 3.3% compared to 5.5% in 2018-19. This can be attributed to a drop in the growth of the manufacturing sector from 6.0% to 2.7% in the current fiscal. The services sector is expected to register a slide in growth by 7.6% compared to 8.1% in 2018-19.

According to the advance estimates, nominal GSDP for 2019-20 is expected to be ‚Çπ28,78,583 crore and real GSDP ‚Çπ21,54,446 crore. The per capita State income in 2019-20 is expected to be ‚Çπ2,07,727. The revenue deficit has risen to ‚Çπ20,293 crore compared to the revised estimates of ‚Çπ14,960 crore for 2018-19. The fiscal deficit is ‚Çπ61,670 crore and the debt stock ‚Çπ4,71,642 crore, the report said. The percentage of fiscal deficit to GSDP is 2.1% and debt stock to GSDP is 16.4%. Both indicators are within the fiscal limits prescribed by the 14th Finance Commission.

In 2018-19, the production of food grains and fruits, and vegetables decreased by 27.3% and 10.1% respectively, whereas sugarcane, oilseeds and cotton increased by 8%, 16.1% and 8.2% respectively over the previous year.

The survey said the unemployment rate in January to March 2019 was 8.3% as compared to 9.6% in October to December 2018. A total of 37,567 offences were reported in the State in 2019, in which women were victims, as compared to 35,497 in 2018 and 31,997 in 2017, the report said. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) inflows in 2019-20 was ‚Çπ25,316 crore, which is less compared to ‚Çπ80,013 crore in 2018-19 and ‚Çπ86,244 crore in 2017-18. Maharashtra was second in the country after Karnataka in terms of FDI in 2019-20.

"The link between jobs, farming and climate","At a panel discussion hosted recently by the students of Delhi‚Äôs Ambedkar University, the topic was, ‚ÄòAre we heading for an economic crisis?‚Äô Presumably, they had been prompted by the all-absorbing news of a slowing economy. It is indeed correct that such a slowing is taking place. Growth has slowed for the past few quarters ‚Äî the past two-and-a-half years, if we go by annual growth rates.

That this has not been comforting to the government is evident from the fact that its Ministers are running from pillar to post in an effort to goose the economy. But should we be worried?

Those who heard the address to the United Nations climate change summit by the teenager Greta Thunberg earlier this month may not be as worried about economic growth as the government is. Globally, industrial growth driven by mindless consumption is the cause of climate change, now unmistakably upon us. But India does need some growth as income levels here are still very low. The problem of low incomes can, however, be tackled even with less growth so long as it is of the appropriate type. So, the slowing of growth in India cannot reasonably be termed a crisis.

Rural unemployment

There is, however, one feature of the economy that does answer positively to the query of whether it is in crisis today, and that is unemployment. Figures reported in the report of the last Periodic Labour Force Survey point to a dramatic rise in the unemployment rate since 2011-12, when the previous survey on unemployment was undertaken. Apart from the category of ‚ÄòUrban Females‚Äô, the most recent estimate of unemployment shows that it is the highest in the 45 years since 1972-73. But even for ‚ÄòUrban Females‚Äô, it is double what it was in 2011-12. For the largest cohort, namely ‚ÄòRural Males‚Äô, in 2017-18, it is four times the average for the 40 years up to 2011-12. These figures should convince us of the existence of a grave situation, if not crisis, with respect to employment in the country. In the average country of the OECD, an increase in unemployment of such magnitude would have triggered a nationwide debate, not to mention agitation on the streets.

The government has responded to the slowing of growth by announcing a range of measures, the most prominent of them being the reduction in the corporate tax rate. While this may have a positive effect, the move is not based on the big picture. The tax cut is meant to be a remedy for stagnant corporate investment. But if the level of corporate investment itself reflects some underlying reality, it is only by tackling the latter that we can get to the root of the problem. A large part of corporate sales is driven by rural demand, reflected in the reported lay-offs by biscuit manufacturers. We do not hear their voices or, more importantly, the government does not, as they are less organised than some other sections of the corporate world, the automobile industry being one such.

The rural picture matters not only because the largest numbers are located there but also because of their low incomes. This means that the future growth of demand for much of industrial production is likely to come from there. After all, how many more flat-screen televisions can an urban middle-class household buy once it already possess one? The high unemployment rate for ‚ÄòRural Males‚Äô does suggest that we have zoomed in up to a reasonable degree of precision on the site of low demand.

Production decline

We must now answer the question of why rural incomes are growing so slowly. The recent history of crop agriculture points towards one reason. In the nine years since 2008-2009, this activity has recorded zero or negative growth in five. Put differently, in the majority of years, it has shown no growth. The economy has very likely not seen anything like this since 1947.

When growth fluctuations include production decline, a particular feature emerges. Households incurring consumption debt in bad crop years would be repaying it in the good ones. This implies that consumption does not grow appreciably even in good years. Recognising the record of agricultural production is sufficient to grasp what we see in India today. This does not imply that other factors do not matter, and we could imagine several, ranging from low export growth to the state of the banking sector, but this does suggest that poor agricultural performance is a significant explanation of slack domestic demand. Unstable agricultural production first lowers the demand for agricultural labour and, subsequently, its supply, showing up in greater unemployment. It has been pointed out that the investment rate has declined. This is indeed correct but this may well be a reflection of the poor agricultural performance. Private investment both follows output growth and leads it. When non-agricultural firms observe slow agricultural growth, they are likely to shrink their investment plans and may not revise their decision till this growth improves. Thus, attempting to influence the private investment rate is to only deal with a symptom. It is rural income generation that is the problem.

Long-term solution

Any long-term solution to the problem of unemployment to which the slowing growth of the economy is related must start with agricultural production. Observing the performance of crop agriculture for close to a decade since 2008-09, we might say that we are witnessing something wholly new in India. It has long been recognised that there is a crop-yield cycle related to annual variations in rainfall but we are now witnessing a stagnation. Now, unlike in the case of a cycle, recovery cannot simply be assumed. We would need the expertise of agricultural scientists to confirm what exactly is responsible for this state but it would not be out to place to ask if there is not a role for ecological factors in causing agricultural stagnation. These factors encompass land degradation involving loss of soil moisture and nutrients, and the drop in the water table, leading to scarcity which raises the cost of cultivation. Almost all of this is directly man-made, related as it is to over-exploitation or abuse, as in the case of excessive fertilizer use, of the earth‚Äôs resources. Then there the increasingly erratic rainfall, seemingly god-given but actually due to climate change entirely induced by human action. A deeper adaptation is required to deal with these factors. Intelligent governance, resource deployment and change in farmer behaviour would all need to combine for this.

It is significant that the reality of an unstable agricultural sector rendering economy-wide growth fragile has not elicited an adequate economic policy response. Policy focus is disproportionately on the tax rate, the ease of doing business in the non-agricultural sector and a fussy adherence to a dubious fiscal-balance target. It is now time to draw in the public agricultural institutes and farmer bodies for their views on how to resuscitate the sector. We may be experiencing an ecological undertow, and it could defeat our best-laid plans for progress.

No unemployment data post-demonetisation: Labour Minister,"There is no data available on unemployment subsequent to the period of demonetisation, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar told Parliament on Monday, in a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha.

More than a third of the questions asked by Members of Parliament to the Labour Ministry on Monday were related to unemployment data. The Ministry held firmly to citing Labour Bureau surveys on unemployment, for which the latest data available is pre-demonetisation. According to this data, the unemployment rate in 2015-16 was 3.7%, Mr. Gangwar said.

‚ÄòNot centrally‚Äô

In response to another question, Mr. Gangwar said, ‚ÄúInformation related to impact of demonetisation on employment in the unorganised sector is not maintained centrally.‚Äù

With regard to the NSSO‚Äôs survey, Mr. Gangwar only said that the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) has ‚Äúinitiated‚Äù the PLFS, whose primary objective is ‚Äúto measure quarterly changes of key Labour Force Indicators such as Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR), Worker Population Ratio (WPR) and Unemployment Rate (UR) in urban areas as well as to generate the annual estimates of different labour force indicators both in rural and urban areas‚Ä¶The report of the same has not been published,‚Äù he said.

Asked why the Labour Bureau‚Äôs Quarterly Employment Surveys have been put on hold, he said that a committee under the chairmanship of former MoSPI secretary T.C.A. Anant had submitted a report examining the current relevance of these surveys and that the report was being studied.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/no-unemployment-data-post-demonetisation-labour-minister/article26177893.ece,
The employment test,"Attuned as we have become to political grandstanding on the purpose of democracy, we may not have imagined that something so prosaic as statistics can alter our perception of how it is actually working for us. The emergence over the past few months of data on employment, speaking precisely the lack of it, cannot but have an influence on our assessment. They paint a picture of an economy that is widely out of line with the government‚Äôs pronouncements on its performance. These have generally avoided any reference to employment, except to say that there is a lack of reliable data on it, for the rectification of which the government itself has done very little.

Arun Jaitley, Finance Minister for the greater part of this government‚Äôs tenure, has claimed that it has coincided with a degree of macroeconomic stability that has not been surpassed. Perhaps he had in mind the combination of falling inflation and declining Budget deficits since 2014. However, while this has indeed transpired, it is important to note that these trends had commenced even before. Moreover, after repeatedly expressing a commitment to fiscal consolidation, the government did not hesitate to swerve from the path of rectitude to finance an income support programme for farmers in an election year.

Silence on jobs

But of greater significance is the fact that neither he nor the Prime Minister has had anything to say about employment. In this the BJP is not unique. Employment does not usually figure in the public discourse orchestrated by political parties, either at the Centre or in the States. This must change, for steady employment is the citizen‚Äôs aspiration, to realise which she elects representatives. Governments in India must therefore be routinely subjected to an employment test which gauges their success in generating and sustaining high employment. In his election campaign in 2014 Narendra Modi had announced that he would generate jobs.

Employment data from government sources (Labour Bureau) for about half a decade up to 2015 and from the independent agency Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) for the period since give us a reasonably good idea of the progress made with respect to employment. When supplemented with other information, these sources also suggest to us the proximate factors responsible for that history. The evidence they provide tell two stories. First, the Modi government has had next to no success in generating employment, notwithstanding its promises at election time. A development that may require some effort to understand fully, but which nevertheless it is important for the citizen to do, is that the labour force may actually have shrunk while it has been in office. The labour force is the sum of the employed and those unemployed who are seeking employment. A shrinking of the labour force is most unusual in an economy with a growing population, and thus a growing working age cohort.

The demonetisation effect

While this decline had already emerged in 2015, it became pronounced after demonetisation in 2016. We owe to CMIE, a private Indian body, both this finding and the articulation of the precise mechanism at work. A section of those hitherto willing to work may have simply dropped out of an already challenged labour market. This possibility is recognised in macroeconomics as the ‚Äòdiscouraged-worker effect‚Äô and has been observed in Western economies. The loss of skill that can accompany being unemployed even temporarily, and the consequent loss of long-run output for the economy, is the basis of the argument that public policy must respond with alacrity to growing unemployment. No such sensibility has infused the government, which appears not to have noticed the decline in the labour force itself, a development that occurred very early in its tenure. It has instead congratulated itself on having delivered macroeconomic stability. We are now able to see that whatever may have been the acclaimed beneficial impact of demonetisation in terms of raising direct tax compliance, it has caused demoralisation among a section of the already unemployed who may have given up all hope of finding employment.

The second of the two histories referred to, seen in the reports of one of the government‚Äôs agencies, is that of a rising unemployment rate from 2011 onwards. This point has political significance as we stay poised for the general election. This is that while the Modi government may have run amok with the demonetisation, India‚Äôs unemployment challenge predates this episode and evidently runs deeper. Labour Bureau data show that the unemployment rate almost doubled between 2011 and 2015. It is surprising that the government‚Äôs own reports did not flag this. The economic, as opposed to the political, message is that the recent history of unemployment has been impervious to the political formation governing India.

If we are to more than just wring our hands at the existant unemployment, an understanding of what underlies it is necessary. Actually, no more than standard macroeconomic analysis is needed in this regard. Both output growth and employment are under normal circumstances associated with capital formation. Capital formation as a share of output has been declining since 2011-12. Unlike consumption expenditure, capital expenditure is unique in expanding both the supply and demand sides of the economy. Despite the declining capital formation, neither United Progressive Alliance (UPA) II nor National Democratic Alliance II considered it necessary to respond to it by stepping up public investment, the obvious thing to do in the prevailing circumstances.

The clue to this inertia may be found in the political economy. For UPA II the success of its first term in office must have looked like the perfect opportunity to expand its political base by legislating rights and reciting the mantra ‚Äúinclusive growth‚Äù. Then came Narendra Modi, who somewhat incongruously for an avowedly nationalist politician, embraced the dogma of the Washington Consensus. Popular in the 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union, it extolled small government and asserted the capacity of the market mechanism to deliver an optimal outcome. There was in this scheme of things no place for any involuntary unemployment. So, whatever may have been the calculation of the two political formations, employment generation just took a back seat in their respective programmes.

Cost of failure?

We have adopted representative democracy as our form of government because we cannot in isolation achieve the outcomes we desire even when they are exclusive to us. Employment is one example of this. Though it manifests itself as jobs for individuals, it is determined by macroeconomic factors which individuals cannot influence on their own. The Great Depression in the 20th century and the Great Recession in the 21st, both which have originated in the U.S. but quickly spread across the world, testify to this helplessness of individuals in the face of market forces. In a democracy, it is left to elected representatives whether to pursue macroeconomic policies conducive to the generation of employment. India‚Äôs political parties have for close to a decade now failed to so, either wilfully or out of neglect. However, when elected to govern, they are given a chance to create the conditions that enable Indians to lead flourishing lives, which includes being meaningfully employed during their working age. India‚Äôs political parties must pass ‚Äòthe employment test‚Äô. When they fail they must vacate the stage.

Unemployment data survey ongoing; results in three months: Centre to Rajya Sabha,"Admitting that nationwide unemployment data is not available since late 2016, the government told the Rajya Sabha that it is in the process of conducting surveys and will release the data within the next two to three months.

In his written answer to a starred question, Labour and Employment Minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar had said, ‚ÄúData is not available for unemployed persons since November, 2016.‚Äù

When questioned about this in the Rajya Sabha, he said, ‚ÄúThe survey is ongoing...the results will come within three months.‚Äù

In his written answer, he had given details of quarterly employment surveys being conducted by the Labour Bureau in eight selected labour-intensive and export-oriented sectors. In total, these sectors added more than 5 lakh jobs between October 2016 and October 2017, it estimated.

Of these, construction was the only sector which saw a fall in employment, with a drop of 11,000 jobs. The best performing sectors were manufacturing, which saw a gain of 1.87 lakh jobs, while the education sector added 1.4 lakh jobs over that year, according to those survey results.

Other sectors which increased employment in that period included health (75,000), trade (57,000), IT and BPO (28,000), transport (21,000) and accomodation and restaurants (10,000).",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/unemployment-data-survey-ongoing-results-in-three-months-centre-to-rajya-sabha/article24455527.ece,
‚ÄòNo unemployed youth would vote for TRS‚Äô,"Hours after the dissolution of the State Assembly followed by Chief Minister‚Äôs press meet on Thursday, groups of unemployed youth gathered at their regular spot here ‚Äî a Rajasthan tea stall ‚Äî for the evening break.

Their first observations response was: ‚ÄúWhy did KCR not speak about the unemployed, and the media present there not raise questions on jobs?‚Äù

The Telangana movement, a Group-II aspirant K. Giribabu recollects, was driven on three demands ‚Äî Neellu, Nidhulu, Niyamakalu ‚Äî water, resources and appointments. ‚ÄúBut what we learnt in the four years after 2014 is patience and enduring pain,‚Äù he says, as others join.

‚ÄúEvery time there is front page news announcing koluvula sambaralu and koluvula jathara, we work even hard but fail to hear any further. There has been no Group-1 notification or an exam calendar. Instead, many pending orders and legal tangles for exams,‚Äù Sekhar Reddy, a guest lecturer in a BC Hostel says.

Cattle and cash

Nalgonda town, known for coaching institutes for aspirants from villages, including from Suryapet and Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri, has more than 3,000 youth in six private centres attending separate batches of classes. Many others live in hostels, study in libraries or reading halls. And, English language being the ‚Äòscare‚Äô, most students opt for State-level exams and only a small number prepare for banks and public service commission exams.

Agitated that the government was ended prematurely leaving many aspirants high and dry, the aggrieved say they have started a word-of-mouth campaign, describing the failed promises to youth, and to not vote for Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) in the forthcoming elections.

"How is economy growing when unemployment rate at highest, asks P. Chidambaram","Former finance minister P. Chidambaram on Friday raised doubts over the GDP figures, wondering how the economy is growing at 7% when the unemployment rate was the highest in 45 years.

Taking a dig at the Centre, he claimed that when the government revised the GDP figures it did not realise that the unemployment figures also got revised.

Mr. Chidambaram‚Äôs remark came ahead of the interim Budget on Friday.

The government on Thursday said it has not finalised the survey on labour force which reportedly showed that the unemployment rate in the country hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18.

The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO‚Äôs) periodic labour force survey (PLFS), according to the Business Standard, states that unemployment was last this high in 1972-73. The unemployment rate was 2.2% in 2011-12, it said.

‚ÄúNITI Aayog vice-chairman asked ‚ÄòHow can a country grow at an average of 7% without employment?‚Äô That is exactly our question. With unemployment at a 45-year high, how can we believe that the economy is growing at 7 per cent,‚Äù Mr. Chidambaram said on Twitter.

‚ÄúModi Government revises GDP growth figures upward. What government did not realise was that unemployment figure was also revised upwards,‚Äù he tweeted.

On Thursday, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar, who had previously mounted a defence of lowering of UPA-era GDP growth rates, at a hurriedly called press conference said the report cited by the newspaper ‚Äúis not finalised. It is a draft report‚Äù.

The report generated a lot of controversy, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi saying the Modi government had promised two crore jobs, but five years later a ‚Äúleaked job creation report card‚Äù has revealed a ‚Äúnational disaster‚Äú.

Mr. Chidambaram also took a swipe at the government over claims of high growth despite demonetisation and asked if this time ‚Çπ100 notes would be demonetised.

‚ÄúThe demonetisation year was the best year of growth (8.2%) under Mr. Modi. So, let‚Äôs have another round of demonetisation.This time let‚Äôs demonetise 100 rupee notes,‚Äù he said.",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/how-is-economy-growing-when-unemployment-rate-at-highest-asks-p-chidambaram/article26147257.ece,
"Declare unemployment national disaster, says youth collective","With the lack of jobs becoming a major issue in the run-up to the Lok Sabha election, over 60 youth groups representing the educated unemployed and government job aspirants have demanded that the Centre declare unemployment a national disaster.

Joining together under the banner of Yuva Halla Bol, the groups passed a resolution on Sunday giving the Central and State governments one month to meet their demands for job opportunities, fair selection, an exam code and recruitment bodies.

‚ÄúThe government must first acknowledge that this is a serious issue; only then they can take action. Instead, they are trying to hide the unemployment data,‚Äù said Anupam, founder of Yuva Halla Bol (YHB) and a vice-president of Yogendra Yadav‚Äôs Swaraj India party.

He was instrumental in creating the YHB coalition in the wake of widespread protests against the Staff Selection Commission examination paper leak in March 2018. ‚ÄúIf the parties in power at the Centre and in the States do not act on our demands, we will take them for being anti-youth, and they should not be our representatives‚Ä¶The youth will campaign against such parties in the election.‚Äù

At a youth summit in the capital, several hundred young men, along with a handful of women, repeated the movement‚Äôs slogan, Job chahiye, jumla nahin, and voiced support as speakers from different States and professions recited a familiar complaint.

‚ÄúThere are 24 lakh sanctioned but vacant posts in State and Central governments. Instead of filling them, the government is destroying jobs‚Ä¶We need a law to guarantee employment for educated youth,‚Äù said Akshay Hunka of Berozgaar Sena, one of the groups that has joined the YHB platform.

Such legislation, which would provide compensation to unemployed youth, is one of the YHB‚Äôs major demands. Another is an exam code with detailed time lines, stipulating that every recruitment process be completed in nine months.

‚ÄúIn 18 years of Jharkhand‚Äôs existence as a State, only five rounds of the Jharkhand Public Service Commission recruitment has happened. For the last round, the notification was issued in January 2015. Till 2019, the recruitment process for that round has not been completed,‚Äù said Sharif Ansar from Jharkhand.

Aspirants for jobs in the railways, the police and schools shared sector-specific grievances. ‚ÄúOut of 24 lakh vacancies, 10-12 lakh are for teachers alone. But the government is not taking education seriously,‚Äù alleged Shailendra Singh.

While the panel was entirely male, a few women were scattered in the audience. ‚ÄúFor many women, it is a fight against patriarchy to get educated and then to apply for a job. When there is such corruption and difficulty in getting a job, many women cannot fight further. I applied for the Basic Teacher Certificate last year, but the exam papers were leaked twice,‚Äù said Lucknow University graduate Pooja Shukla, who says she has been blacklisted from admission to a Masters degree because of her involvement in student agitations. ‚ÄúThe government wants the youth to stay unemployed, so they can make money off us. No one is refunding application fees to those who do not get the job.‚Äù

At a recent railway recruitment exam, 2.37 crore people applied for 60,000 vacancies, each applicant paying a ‚Çπ500 fee. ‚ÄúThe Railways made over ‚Çπ1,000 crore from that one exam,‚Äù said Anupam. ‚ÄúAnd each candidate fills in a dozen such forms for different exams. Apart from exam fees, there are coaching classes, books and hostels. We are trying to quantify the value of this whole parallel industry that feeds off the hopes of poor unemployed youth.‚Äù",https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/declare-unemployment-national-disaster-says-youth-collective/article26105589.ece,
"India's Unemployment Rate Rises to 7.78% in February, Highest in 4 Months: CMIE","New Delhi: India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 7.78 per cent in February, the highest since October 2019, and up from 7.16 per cent in January, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Monday, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

India‚Äôs economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37 per cent in February from 5.97 per cent in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65 per cent from 9.70 per cent, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed.

Beyond Unemployment Rate: More People in Their 20s Have Stopped Looking for Jobs,"A slowing economy has often thrown up questions on the unemployment rate among Indian youth. Our GDP is expected to have hit a multi-quarter low at below five per cent for the July-September quarter this fiscal (official data for which is yet to be released), prompting fresh concerns over job creation. Economists have been arguing that India‚Äôs shrinking industrial output, slower growth in services and a slowing external trade amid slackening investments by corporate India may have all contributed to rising joblessness. But government data has not proved this theory in any conclusive manner, though private agencies have shown that unemployment is on the rise.

Previous government labour data, with which current numbers could have been compared, have been rendered incomparable with present stats since the methodology for the periodic labour force survey (PLFS) was changed some time back. So, when a leaked PLFS report showed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate for people aged 15 years and above was at a 45-year high of six per cent in 2017-18, the government said these numbers were not comparable with previous data since the survey methodology had been changed.

Against this background comes the latest quarterly PLFS report for January-March 2019 (Q1 2019) showing a slight improvement in unemployment parameters over the immediate previous quarter (Q4 2018). According to the PLFS for 2019, the unemployment rate in urban areas for all ages was 9.3 per cent in Q1 2019, down from 9.9 per cent in Q4 2018 and lowest in a year. For people aged 15 years and above, this figure was 9.2 per cent, down from 9.7 per cent in Q4 2018. And for the youth, 15-29 years, unemployment rate was 22.5 per cent, compared to 23.7 per cent in Q4 2018. So the unemployment rate has fallen sequentially for all the three categories of workers the PLFS tracks.

But private data sources have been talking of a rise, not a dip, in unemployment. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), showed that the unemployment rate was 6.87 per cent between January and April this year, a significant increase from 5.5 per cent in the same four months of 2018 and a slight increase from the unemployment rate of 6.67 per cent in the September-December period of 2018. The sample size, methodology, etc, are different for CMIE and PLFS.

Anyway, the pertinent data point to note from the latest PLFS is that at least every fifth Indian youth remains jobless with unemployment staying above 22 per cent for a year. Is this not a worrying state of affairs despite marginal improvement in jobs data?

Another point to ponder: the PLFS data also shows that the labour force participation rate (LFPR) has dipped in Q1, indicating that a weak economy may be forcing people to quit looking for jobs and withdraw from the workforce. The LFPR for all ages in urban India was 36 per cent in Q1 2019 against 36.3 per cent in Q4 2018. If one were to take just the urban youth, in the 15-29 year age group, the LFPR dipped to 37.7 per cent from 38.2 per cent quarter on quarter, showing the rate at which urban youth ‚Äì the most employable segment of any population ‚Äì has been withdrawing from the labour force.

Then, while national official statistics provide some cheer in terms of unemployment percentage, a look at the conditions in different states throws up a mixed bag. Take Kerala for example. India‚Äôs most literate state (as per the 2011 Census) continues to house the highest proportion of unemployed urban youth among all states while Gujarat has the least percentage of jobless youth.

The PLFS 2019 data shows that 37.2 per cent urban youth were unemployed in Kerala in Q1 2019 this year. In other words, at least every third urban youth in the state was jobless when the national percentage of unemployment was 22.5 per cent or at least every fifth. For Gujarat, the unemployment among urban youth stood at just 9.5 per cent, or less than even one in 10.

https://english.mathrubhumi.com/news/kerala/36-25-lakh-are-unemployed-in-kerala-outnumbers-national-average--1.4241096

This piece in the Mathrubhumi newspaper says that over 36 lakh people, including medical and engineering graduates, remain unemployed in the state. And among the unemployed youth, women outnumber men, with over 23 lakh women remaining unemployed.

The PLFS shows that more than six in 10 (60.1 per cent) urban young women in Kerala were jobless in Q1 2019 against 29 per cent at the national level and this was an increase from 57.6 per cent such women in the immediately preceding quarter. The percentage of unemployed young women hovered around the 60 per cent mark of only two other states this year: Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir. Gujarat continued to provide employment to the maximum number of young urban women with the unemployment rate in this category lowest among all states, at 10.5 per cent, even though this was the highest unemployment among urban young Gujarati women in a year.

The PLFS data also leads us to another worrying trend: declining female labour force participation and rising female unemployment. The female LFPR remains between 16-17 per cent, which means only every sixth woman is even seeking employment. For Q1 2019, the LFPR for women was 15 per cent (all ages) against 56.2 per cent for men. For the age group of 15-29 years, it was 16 per cent, versus 57.9 per cent for men. Nearly three in 10 young women were unemployed in Q1 on an all-India basis but, in some states, the ratio of women employed was highly skewed.

The data was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for his second term. Indian voters gave him a big mandate in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8% in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years.

"Unemployment in India at 45-Year High After Demonetisation, Report Stalled by Centre Shows","New Delhi: The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey recorded the unemployment rate in India at a 45-year-high of 6.1 percent in 2017-18, Business Standard reported on Thursday.







Two independent members of the National Statistical Commission had resigned this week after the government allegedly failed to publish the report that was prepared last month. The report is still not public.







This is the first survey on employment by a government agency after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes in November 2016. The Periodic Labour Force Survey is the first annual household survey of the National Sample Survey Office and data was collected between July 2017 and June 2018.







Documents reviewed by the Business Standard showed that unemployment rate was at its highest since the 1972-73 period, from when the employment data is comparable. In comparison, the unemployment rate stood at 2.2% in 2011-12, during the United Progressive Alliance‚Äôs second term, according to the survey.







The report showed that the unemployment rate among the youth was at a higher level compared to previous years and ‚Äúmuch higher compared to that in the overall population‚Äù.







The rate of unemployment among men in rural areas between the ages of 15 and 29 years jumped to 17.4 percent in 2017-18 compared to 5 percent in 2011-12. The unemployment rate among women in rural areas stood at 13.6 percent in 2017-18 compared to 4.8 percent in 2011-12, according to the survey.







Unemployment among youth in urban areas was higher than in rural areas ‚Äì 18.7 percent for men and 27.2 percent for women in 2017-18.







More among the educated were jobless in 2017-18 than they were in 2004-05. For educated women in rural areas, unemployment was at 17.3 percent in 2017-18 compared to 9.7 percent-15.2 percent during 2004-05 to 2011-12. For educated men in rural areas, the unemployment rose to 10.5 percent in 2017-18 compared to 3.5 percent to 4.4 percent during 2004-05 to 2011-12.







The labour force participation rate, which is the proportion of population working or seeking jobs, declined from 39.5 percent in 2011-12 to 36.9 percent in 2017-18. The labour force participation has been declining since 2004-05.

"OPINION | As India Stares at Record Unemployment, Govt's Acknowledgement Just First Step Towards Battling Crisis","New Delhi: The two biggest challenges for Modi 2.0 are a slowing economy and a severe unemployment crisis. Both the pain points are a legacy of this government‚Äôs first term, a five-year period when at least on the jobs front, the government remained in complete denial.

In a famous television interview in January 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had waived aside all criticism on lack of jobs and said selling ‚Äòpakoras‚Äô also counted as employment. This ‚Äòpakodanomics‚Äô was mocked by the Opposition and subsequently led to a fierce debate over the number of jobs being created, the quality of these jobs and whether there were enough jobs for the millions of Indians who were joining the labour force afresh every year.

In that TV interview, the PM had said, ‚ÄúIn one year, more than 70 lakh provident fund accounts have been added. Over 10 crore people have benefited from Mudra Yojana launched by the Centre... Government initiatives have empowered small-scale entrepreneurs and informal sectors. If someone opens a 'pakoda' shop in front of your office, does that not count as employment? The person's daily earning of Rs 200 will never come into any books or accounts. The truth is massive people are being employed.‚Äù

Now, as the latest economic and jobs data underlines the massive problems at hand, there is reluctant acknowledgment that things do not look too bright. The government‚Äôs own data show that GDP growth was the slowest in five years last fiscal, falling below the 7% mark (at 6.8%) in 2018-19. In the last quarter of that year, GDP growth was only 5.8%, lowest in 20 quarters. As for unemployment, the government‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey ‚Äî which was finally released earlier this month ‚Äî showed unemployment reached a 45-year high at 6.1% in 2017-18, with the youth, the educated and women facing the most trouble in getting jobs.

And this is not all. Unemployment has continued to rise in 2019 too and according to estimates by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE), the unemployment rate in May this year was 7.17%. This was slightly better than the 7.35% in April but much higher than the 6% average in 2018.

The CMIE unemployment database comprises about 522,000 people, providing employment or unemployment status for each member (who is greater than or equal to 15 years of age). For the government‚Äôs first annual PLFS, 12,800 First Stage Units or FSUs (7,024 villages and 5,776 UFS blocks) were surveyed at the all-India level during July 2017-June 2018. The PLFS covered 102,113 households (56,108 in rural areas) and 433,339 persons.

So as the economic engine slows down and more jobs continue to vanish, it is heartening to see that the government has finally woken up. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister formed two Cabinet committees to address economic woes and unemployment. Of these, the Cabinet Committee on Employment and Skill Development (CCESD) is tasked with tackling the jobs challenge. Besides Modi, it comprises 14 top ministers, including those heading finance, agriculture, commerce, small & medium enterprises, labour and HRD ministries.

So how bad is the jobs scenario in India? The PLFS highlights some alarming trends:

One, as unemployment breached a four-decade-high figure, it is the urban youth who face the worst prospects for a job. The PLFS says 18.7% or every sixth urban male youth, aged between 15-29 years, was unemployed in 2017-18. The only group which fared worse than even the young urban male was the young urban female, since more than one in four were unemployed at 27.2%.

Two, during 2017-18, about 54.9% of rural males and 18.2% of rural females were in the labour force; about 57% urban males and 15.9% urban females were in the labour force. This means, just about one in two rural men and a little more than one in two urban men were working at a job; about one in six rural women and less than one in six urban women held a job.

Three, between 2004-05 and 2011-12 as well as between 2011-12 and 2017-18, the labour force participation rate for rural males remained almost at the same level. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, for rural female, LFPR decreased by nearly 8 percentage point and between 2011-12 and 2017-18 it further decreased by around 7 percentage points. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12 as well as between 2011-12 and 2017-18 rounds, LFPR for urban males remained at the same level. For urban females, between 2004-05 and 2011-12, LFPR decreased by about 2 percentage points and between 2011-12 and 2017-18, it remained almost at the same level. So more and more rural women are dropping out of the workforce.

Four, the unemployment rate for educated Indians was significantly higher compared to the overall rate. For educated (highest level of education secondary and above) rural males and rural females, unemployment rates were 10.5% and 17.3% respectively.

As per CMIE data too, there is an upward trend in the unemployment series; the unemployment rate is rising because employment has stagnated and there is a steady and large stream of new employment seekers entering the labour market.

‚ÄúThis is particularly true for urban India, where employment is falling. Employment in urban India during each of the ten months ending May 2019 was lower than it was during the corresponding month a year ago. In 11 of the past 12 months, employment in urban India was lower than it was a year ago. While urban employment has been falling, the ranks of the urban unemployed have been rising steadily,‚Äù CMIE said.

It is evident that a severe jobs crisis is on our hands. The sooner the government addresses it through a mix of policy initiatives and measures to boost the economy (which will in turn create jobs), the better it will be.

Major Boost for Under Fire Kamal Nath Govt as Unemployment Rate Falls to 4.2% in Madhya Pradesh,"Bhopal: Under fire from Bharatiya Janata Party over accusations of failure in the first ten months of his rule, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Tuesday received a major boost as an independent monitoring agency in its report claimed that joblessness has declined in MP in the last nine months.

In its report for September, 2019, Mumbai based private firm, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), claimed that unemployment rate in MP has dipped to 4.2% in the last nine months.

According to the report, joblessness is still high in neighbouring states of Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan with unemployment rates of 8.6 per cent and 7.4 per cent respectively. Both the states are also ruled by the Congress party.

Buoyed by the report, CM Kamal Nath on Monday tweeted: ‚ÄúDue to the mis-governance of the BJP, the unemployment rate had soared to 7% but the Congress government has shattered the joblessness under its rule. With the efficient policies, we have managed to bring down the unemployment rate by 40%.‚Äù

PC Sharma, the public relations minister, credited the turnaround in MP to the implementation of the Chhindwara model across the state. Meanwhile, the BJP has rejected the outcome of the report.

Abhilash Pandey, the president of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, belied the data mentioned in the report. ‚ÄúWe would soon reach out to the youth in the state at mandal and booth level and would prepare database of jobless youths,‚Äù Pandey added.

CMIE--the private firm established in year 1976, had earlier reported that during the last one year of the BJP rule, the unemployment rate had surged to 7% from paltry a 1.2% in June 2017.

This phase of the 15-year BJP rule was also marred by persistent protests from Berozgar Sena, a volunteer organisation underlining the plight of joblessness in MP.

Akshay Hunka, the former convener of Berozgar Sena who later joined Congress, speaking to News18 claimed that Congress government has infused positivity in the state economy.

It is heartening to note that MP is recording surge in job creation at a time when the entire country is reeling under economic sluggishness, Hunka said.

"India's Unemployment Highest Since 2016, Climbs to 7.2% in February: CMIE Report","New Delhi: The unemployment rate in India rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, the highest since September 2016, and up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) that was released on Tuesday.

The unemployment rate has climbed despite a fall in the number of job seekers, Mahesh Vyas, head of the Mumbai-based think-tank said, citing an estimated fall in the labour force participation rate. The number of employed persons in India was estimated at 400 million in February compared with 406 million a year ago, he said.

The CMIE numbers are based on a survey of tens of thousands of households across the country. The figures are regarded by many economists as more credible than the jobless data produced by the government.

The figures will be unwelcome news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the Lok Sabha elections due to be held by early May. Concerns about weak farm prices and low jobs growth are often brought up as election issues by opposition parties.

When the government has released official data for the jobless rate in the past it has tended to be out-of-date. But recently it withheld a batch of data because officials said they needed to check its veracity.

The figures that were withheld in December were leaked to a local newspaper a few weeks ago, and showed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18.

A CMIE report released in January said nearly 11 million people lost jobs in 2018 after the demonetisation of high value notes in late 2016 and the chaotic launch of a new goods and services tax in 2017, hit millions of small businesses.

The government told Parliament last month that it did not have data on the impact of demonetisation on jobs in small businesses.

"Unemployment and Inflation Increased, We All Have to Suffer: RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat","Nagpur: Expressing his displeasure over the government‚Äôs policies, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that inflation and unemployment have increased in the country and everyone has had to bear its impact.

""The policies in the country affect everybody. I do not make the policy nor you, but we all have to bear its impact. Inflation increased, I did not increase it nor you, but we all have to suffer. Unemployment increased, I did not increase it nor you, but we all have to suffer. That is why we will have to learn to live for our country,"" he said at the silver jubilee of the Prahaar Samaaj Jagruti Sanstha in Nagpur.

Bhagwat‚Äôs apparent criticism came after RSS general secretary Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi rued the delay in the construction of the Ram Temple and sarcastically remarked that ""now, it (the temple) will be constructed only in 2025.""

The reference was to the series of delays, political and legal tangles bogging the BJP's assurances of taking up the temple construction.

Bhagwat also lamented that though there was no war going on, soldiers were still dying on the country's borders.

This was happening because ""we are not doing our job properly"", he said at the function on Thursday.

He said it was time to sacrifice life for the country before India gained freedom. After Independence, one had to do it on the borders when there was a war, the RSS chief said.

""(But) in our country there is no war (at the moment), still people (soldiers) are getting martyred....because we are not doing our job properly,"" he said.

""Otherwise, if there is no war then there is no reason why a soldier should die on the border. But it is happening,"" he said, adding that steps must be taken as a society to stop this and ""make the country great"".

He said people have to strive all the time to make one's country great.

""Everybody has to strive...this is not something for which we can give contract to somebody. (We rest easy thinking) the government will do it, police will do it, the Army will do it, but it's not like that, the entire society has to make efforts,"" Bhagwat said.",https://www.news18.com/news/politics/unemployment-and-inflation-increased-we-all-have-to-suffer-rss-chief-mohan-bhagwat-2006825.html,
"In Lok Sabha, Govt Says Unemployment Rate Almost Doubled Between 2013-14 and 2017-18","New Delhi: In a reply to Congress MP Kodikkunnil Suresh in the Lok Sabha, Ministry of Labour and Employment on Monday said that the unemployment rate in the country has increased from 3.4 percent in 2013-14 to 6 percent in 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

According to the reply, the unemployment rate stood at 3.7% in 2015-16.

Meanwhile, government data released last month showed that the urban unemployment rate between January-March 2019 stood at 9.3 percent. During April-June 2018, it stood at 9.8 percent.

The data showed that unemployment rate in urban areas among males was estimated at 8.7 per cent during January-March 2019 as compared to 9 per cent during April-June 2018.

For women, the UR was at 11.6 per cent during the reported period as against 12.8 per cent during April-June 2018.

The government had been receiving a lot of criticism for high unemployment rates amid slowing economic growth.

The statement last month pointed out that the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) was estimated as 36 per cent in the urban areas during January-March 2019, as compared to 35.6 per cent during April- June 2018.

The LFPR for men was estimated to be 56.2 per cent, while for women it was at 15 per cent in the urban areas during the January-March 2019 period.",https://www.news18.com/news/business/in-lok-sabha-govt-says-unemployment-rate-almost-doubled-between-2013-14-and-2017-18-2409081.html,
United Nations' New Report Blames Unemployment in India for Increase in South Asia's Food Insecurity,"New Delhi: A recent report released by the United Nations has blamed the unemployment rate in India and the economic slowdown in Pakistan for the increase in food insecurity in South Asia.

As per the report, severe food insecurity is concentrated in South Asia and has increased from less than 11 percent in 2017 to more than 14 percent in 2018. The report attributed the increase to the rise of unemployment rate in India between 2017 and 2018. As per the NSSO report released earlier this year, the rate of unemployment in the country was record 45 years high.

The report titled ‚ÄòThe State of Food Security And Nutrition In The World, 2019‚Äô is a global analysis collaborated by Food and Agriculture Organizations (FAO) in partnership with World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF and International Fund for Agricultural Development.

In context of India, the report adds that the economic slowdown coupled with natural resource depletion and climate change has negatively impacted the food production and employment opportunities. This has led to increased threats to food security due to lower purchasing power. Quoting a World Bank report, it stated that the economic growth in the agricultural sector has been slower than the industrial and services sector.

The report acknowledged a decline in poverty rate proportional to an increase in the per capita GDP. The report has praised the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), world‚Äôs largest public works programme, for helping rural households to stabilise their earnings and to smooth their consumption all along the year.

Comparing the two Asian giants, India and China, the report stated the rate of poverty reduction with respect to the growth of per capita GDP was more in the latter than the former. During 1999 and 2005, China‚Äôs estimate income elasticity of poverty, i.e. percentage reduction in poverty with economic growth, was at 1.51, whereas that of India was at 0.4.

Between 1990 and 2017, India and China had an average GDP per capita growth of 4.5 percent and 8.6 percent, respectively. The poverty reduction here ‚Äòmodestly‚Äô moved ‚Äúfrom 48.9 percent in 1987 to 21.2 percent in 2011, or to 13.4 percent in 2015 if another World Bank source is used‚Äù; while that in China, it declined from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015. Notably, India has been categorised under a lower-middle income country while China as upper-middle income country. Both the countries have been classified as low commodity dependent countries with low export and import.

The report also mentioned health infrastructure and literacy to establish the trends in poverty and food insecurity. In India, there were 0.8 hospital beds for every 1,000 people in 1980, which declined to 0.7 in 2011. On the contrary, it rose from 2.2 to 3.8 in China from 1980 to 2011. The report flagged that 51 percent of women of reproductive age (15-49) have been anaemic. The number increased from 165.6 million in 2012 to 175.6 million women in 2016. However, the prevalence of undernourishment in India has decreased from 22.2 percent during 2002-04 to 14.8 percent during 2015-17. Stunting in children under 5 years of age fell from 54.2 percent in 2000 to 38.4 percent in 2015 ‚Äì still higher than the global average of 23.2 percent. Stunting prevalence has been noted to be higher in ‚Äòhouseholds with lower wealth and income‚Äô.

‚ÄúOnly in 2011 India was able to reach the levels of literacy that China had in 1982,‚Äù the report said.

"Unemployment Is The Biggest Problem Facing the Country, Says Nitin Gadkari","Nagpur: Unemployment is the biggest of the major problems facing the country, Union Minister Nitin



Gadkari said on Friday, adding that there was a ""difference"" between employment and jobs.

He was addressing a youth empowerment summit organised by Fortune Foundation here.

Speaking on employment generation, Gadkari said, ""To address the problem of unemployment, not everyone can get jobs. Because there is a difference between employment and jobs. There are limitations to jobs and therefore creation of employment is the main part of the financial policy of any government.""

""There is a need to think about how to create employment opportunities in rural and urban areas of the country,"" Gadkari added.

He claimed that the Maharashtra government had managed to create jobs in Vidarbha, particularly Nagpur in the last four years, and cited Multi-modal International Cargo Hub and Airport (MIHAN), the Butibori MIDC area and Nagpur metro rail as examples.

""Chief Minister (Devendra) Fadnavis and I are both from Nagpur and had decided to provide employment to at least 50,000 youths of Vidarbha,"" he said.

""Accordingly, about 27,000 youths have already got employment opportunities in various ways and the figure will



cross 50,000 by next year,"" Gadkari claimed.

Stressing that electricity, water and roads were required for industries that would generate employment, Gadkari said the state government was working towards it.

He said the state was working towards achieving electricity surplus and was also building Rs 1 lakh crore worth of roads in the Vidarbha region.

Gadkari informed that the Union government will be initiating irrigation works estimated at Rs 1 lakh crore in Maharashtra.

""About Rs 9.5 lakh crore loans have been distributed under Mudra Yojana initiated by the Prime Minister. Besides, Rs 11 lakh crore loan has been distributed in the agriculture sector,"" he said.

India's Urban Unemployment Rate Drops to Over 9.3% in January-March 2019: Govt Data,"New Delhi: The urban unemployment rate in the country fell to 9.3 per cent during January-March 2019 from 9.8 per cent in April-June 2018, government data showed on Saturday.







The data does not contain comparable figure for the year-ago period of January-March 2018.

The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation released its Quarterly Bulletin for the January-March 2019 period, presenting estimates of labour force indicators, for urban areas, a statement said.

The data showed that unemployment rate in urban areas among males was estimated at 8.7 per cent during January-March 2019 as compared to 9 per cent during April-June 2018.

For women, the UR was at 11.6 per cent during the reported period as against 12.8 per cent during April-June 2018.

The government had been receiving a lot of criticism for high unemployment rates amid slowing economic growth. In May this year, government data had shown that joblessness in the country was 6.1 per cent of total labour force during 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The statement on Saturday pointed out that the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) was estimated as 36 per cent in the urban areas during January-March 2019, as compared to 35.6 per cent during April- June 2018.

"Report Claiming Unemployment in Country at 45-Year High Not 'Verified', Says NITI Aayog","New Delhi: Hours after a National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)‚Äôs leaked report on the state of jobs in the country, which had been earlier withheld by the government, revealed that unemployment had reached a four decade-long high, the NITI Ayog claimed that the data was ‚Äònot verified‚Äô as the NSSO report was yet to be finalised.

At a hurriedly convened press conference, NITI Ayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar attempted to downplay and dismiss the leaked NSSO report and said the numbers were not comparable to the unemployment data collected from 2010-11 as sample size and methodology of survey were different.

‚ÄúI want to state categorically that the report is not finalised yet. It is just a draft report. The data cited (in news reports) is not yet finalised and approved by the government. Therefore, using it is not the right thing to do,‚Äù Kumar told reporters. He added that the ‚Äòleaked draft report was creating confusion‚Äô.

The reason why the NSSO report had not yet been put in public domain, Kumar said it was because the baseline data from July to September 2017 quarter could only be verified after being crosschecked with data from July to September 2018 quarter, which was not part of the NSSO report.

‚ÄúThe data from July to September 2018 has just been received and processed. Without that data, we cannot do a quarter on quarter comparison. We have to make sure the data collected in first round is verified by the data collected in subsequent quarter.‚Äù

Kumar said neither did the NITI Aayog know the ‚ÄòDelta‚Äô (the difference between data sets from two quarters) nor could it vouch for the veracity of the data. According to him, data from four quarters from 2017 and 2018 was included in the NSSO report and they needed to be crosschecked and verified with data from comparable last two quarters (till December 2018) which had just been received by the NITI Aayog.

The NITI Aayog Vice Chairman said that it was ‚Äòwrong‚Äô to compare present data on unemployment with data from 2010-11. ‚ÄúThat was a quinquennial (done every five years) survey and the methodology was very different. It was divided on the basis of only two strata: affluent and poor. The present data is collected annually, quarter on quarter. It is based on educational qualification of households,‚Äù Kumar said.

According to Kumar, It was incorrect to use the NSSO report as a final one to infer that unemployment is high as it must be verified with data collected in second round.

Kumar, along with the NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, then went on to cite various surveys and reports done by private firms and third parties like McKinsey, Ghosh and Ghosh and Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers and said that data from those surveys suggest about 7.5 to 8 million jobs had been added to Indian economy. They, however, did not say if the data they had cited for their argument was verified or not.

‚ÄúWorld Bank, IMF, UN, whatever report you take, they show Indian economy is growing at about 7 per cent. So where is that growth coming from if no jobs are being added?‚Äù Kumar questioned reporters. ‚ÄúThere is a lot of evidence that jobs have been created in the last four years,‚Äù he added.

Kumar said that the NSSO report, as widely reported, had not been suppressed by the government but merely withheld for verification purposes and the final data in unemployment in India would be available in public domain in March. The leaked data that appeared in a Business Standard report Thursday morning had not yet been approved, Kumar said. However, he deflected questions about the resignation of two independent National Statistical Commission (NSC) members over the delay in release of the NSSO data. ‚ÄúPeople resigning will have their own personal reasons, they have not contacted me, neither have I contacted them,‚Äù Kumar said.

Reporters questioned Kumar and Kant over their claim that the data was yet to be approved and argued that the data was slated to release in December 2018. The NSC had already approved the release, so whose approval was required now. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who else will approve it, I think the cabinet will,‚Äù Kumar said.

Kumar also refused to comment on the report that cited leaked NSSO data, revealing that India was facing its worst jobs crisis in 45 years. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt comment on Business Standard report because it has not been released by the government,‚Äù he said. Kumar, however, had no objections when Kant went on to cite data that said Ola and Uber had added a total 2.2 million jobs in the transport sector in the past few years. When questioned that a large chunk of that data would overlap as several drivers are registered on both cab aggregator platforms, a flustered Kant said, ‚ÄúThat must be only 15 per cent of total drivers.‚Äù He did not, however, back his claim with any verified data.

The NITI Aayog CEO went on to say that the problem was not lack of jobs but the lack of good quality jobs. ‚ÄúThere is a wages problem and there is large informal sector,‚Äù Kant said. He added that there were jobs being created for new entrants, but the quality of those jobs was not high. Kant also said that attempts to formalise the informal jobs sector were underway. ‚ÄúIt is unbelievable that no new jobs are being created,‚Äù Kant at one point said.

Toward the end, Kumar and Kant stood up to leave as journalists called the press conference 'totally misleading' and 'utterly unfortunate'.

The NITI Aayog press conference was announced hours after an explosive Business Standard report that had accessed the delayed NSSO Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), revealed that unemployment in India was at 45-year high and stood at a record 6.1 per cent in the year 2017-18. The report cited NSSO data from the first full fiscal year following demonetisation.

The two NSC members, including acting chairman, resigned on Monday, claiming that the government had sidelined them and withheld the release of the report that could potentially cause damage to the government ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.

National Disaster: Rahul Gandhi Attacks Modi as Leaked Report Reveals Ballooning Unemployment,"New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday said it was time for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to go as he had failed to keep his 2014 promise of adding two crore jobs every year.

Citing a media report on the leaked findings of the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey, which pegged unemployment at a 45-year-high, Gandhi termed the job creation report card as a ‚Äúnational disaster‚Äù.

NoMo Jobs!



The Fuhrer promised us 2 Cr jobs a year. 5 years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a National Disaster.

According to the survey findings reported by Business Standard, India is facing unprecedented unemployment of 6.1% in 2017-18. The report has not been made public with two members of the National Statistical Commission alleging that the government was delaying the data.

The two members had resigned earlier this week, following which the Congress accused the Modi government of ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù another institution.

Reacting to Gandhi's comment, the BJP tweeted from its official handle: ""It's clear that he has inherited Mussolini's shortsightedness and has myopic understanding of issues. EPFO's real data shows sharp increase in jobs, created in just the last 15 months. Only a man who hasn't ever held a proper job & is totally jobless can peddle such.""

The NSSO report was the first survey on employment by a government agency after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes in November 2016. The Periodic Labour Force Survey is the first annual household survey of the National Sample Survey Office and data was collected between July 2017 and June 2018.

It showed that the unemployment rate among the youth was at a higher level compared to previous years and ‚Äúmuch higher compared to that in the overall population‚Äù.

The rate of unemployment among men in rural areas between the ages of 15 and 29 years jumped to 17.4 percent in 2017-18 compared to 5 percent in 2011-12. The unemployment rate among women in rural areas stood at 13.6 percent in 2017-18 compared to 4.8 percent in 2011-12, according to the survey.

Unemployment among youth in urban areas was higher than in rural areas ‚Äì 18.7 percent for men and 27.2 percent for women in 2017-18.

Shortly after the report went viral, #HowstheJobs shot up as the top trend on Twitter, a parody of the immensely popular ‚ÄòHow‚Äôs the Josh‚Äô punch-line from the movie Uri: The Surgical Strike. The dialogue has been used by several BJP leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union ministers Nirmala Sitharaman, Manohar Parrikar and Smriti Irani.",https://www.news18.com/news/politics/nomo-jobs-rahul-gandhi-mocks-modi-as-leaked-report-reveals-ballooning-unemployment-2020543.html,
"Unemployment Not the Only Problem, 8 out of 10 Indians Don't Even Have Decent Jobs","New Delhi: That India is experiencing jobless growth is worrying‚Äîwell, that‚Äôs old news. What‚Äôs more alarming is the fact that those who are employed continue to suffer from dangerous and demeaning jobs.

According to the 2018 United Nations Human Development Report (UNHDR), some 77.5 per cent workers in India are under vulnerable employment. This data is way higher than the global average of 42.5 per cent; and if you were to rank India as per this metrics, the country with 51.9 per cent employment to population ratio would hit almost the bottom deck at 180 in a list of 189 countries.

The International Labour Organization‚Äôs (ILO) World Employment and Social Outlook report published earlier in January this year predicted that of the 535 million labour force in India in 2019, some 398.6 million would have poor quality jobs.

An estimated 1.4 billion workers were found to be living in vulnerable employment globally in 2017, the report mentioned, and an additional 17 million are expected to join the ranks per year in 2018 and 2019.

Vulnerable employment is often characterised by inadequate earnings, low productivity and difficult conditions of work that undermine workers‚Äô fundamental rights. The United Nations defines it as the sum of the employment status groups of own account workers and contributing family workers. They are less likely to have formal work arrangements, and are therefore more likely to be subjected to indecent working conditions and lack basic social security.

The report notes that ""while there has been strong job creation in some ICT-intensive services, notably in India, a significant portion of the jobs created in the services sector over the past couple of decades have been in traditional low value-added services, where informality and vulnerable forms of employment are often dominant.""

In general, the incidence of vulnerable employment is highest in the agriculture sector, which employs more than 50 per cent of the total workforce in India. It is followed up by the manufacturing sector, where another 30 million workers suffer from long hours and improper wages.

‚ÄúThe (Central) government should implement the Maharashtra (Rural) Employment Guarantee Scheme all throughout the country and increase public sector expenditure in all areas, more importantly in education and health care, to address this problem,‚Äù distinguished political economist Amiya Kumar Bagchi said.

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) gives the legal guarantee of hundred days of wage employment to adult members of a rural household who demand employment and are willing to do unskilled manual work. The Employment Guarantee Scheme in Maharashtra, on the other hand, provides wage employment ‚Äúthroughout the year to every adult person who volunteers to do unskilled manual work‚Äù.

It is concerning that while the overall unemployment rate in India hovers between 3.4 per cent to 3.5 per cent between 2017-19, the unemployment rate in youths (15-24 age group)‚Äîcomprising 28 per cent of the total population‚Äîis predicted to increase further from 10 per cent in 2014 to 10.7 per cent in 2019.

What‚Äôs even more worrying is that female labour participation rate in India stands at 27.2 per cent as against 78.8 per cent than that of male‚Äîa difference of 51.6 per cent‚Äîthe UNHDR report found. It ranked India 12th on the list of 20 countries with the widest difference in male and female labour force participation rates.

"Govt Dubs Leaked NSSO Report on Unemployment as Fake, Says Data Still Not Processed","New Delhi: Minister for Statistics Sadananda Gowda on Thursday told Lok Sabha that the NSSO is still processing quarterly data from July-December 2018 on unemployment, as the opposition attacked the NDA government alleging that it was trying to hide the NSC survey.

Terming as ""fake"" a report cited by some members that unemployment rate touched 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the highest since 1972-73, Gowda said the final data is always brought out by the Government and the National Statistics Commission (NSC) only guides it in conducting survey.

As the opposition in Lok Sabha raised the issue of the NSC survey on unemployment, Gowda said it is a periodic labour force survey of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).

""The sample for urban labour force data has to be collected quarterly, while for rural yearly for the period July 2017-December 2018. We are in the process of collecting and processing quarterly data for July-September and October-December 2018,"" Gowda said.

A controversy erupted after two members of the NSC -- PC Mohanan and JV Meenakshi-- resigned amid the government holding back release of its unemployment survey. NSC is the apex advisory body on statistical matters. Mohanan was serving as chairman of NSC.

""NSC is an autonomous institution. They guide us in doing surveys. Bringing out the final data is the responsibility of the government. We are still collecting data,"" Gowda said.

He said the Ministry has not yet come out with any report. ""What you are citing is a fake report,"" Gowda said.

Mohammad Salem (CPM) said at a time when the government is talking about digital village, it is saying that it does not have data.

""They are being arrogant, but not revealing data,"" Salem said.

'If Unemployment Rises and Incomes Decline...': P Chidambaram Warns Govt over 'Sliding Economy',"New Delhi: Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Tuesday attacked the Modi government over the state of the economy, saying if unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is a danger of youth and students ""exploding in anger"".







""The nation is engrossed with the anti-CAA, anti-NPR protests. Both present a clear and present danger,"" Chidambaram said.

The sliding economy is an even greater threat to the country, the former finance minister said in a series of tweets.

""If unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is the danger of youth and students exploding in anger,"" he said.

Chidambaram also attacked the government over the rising consumer price index (CPI) inflation.

Retail inflation jumped sharply to 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI's comfort level, mainly due to high food prices, government data showed on Monday.

The retail inflation based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) was 2.11 per cent in December 2018 and 5.54 per cent in November 2019.

""The circle of incompetent management is complete. Mr Narendra Modi's government started in July 2014 with CPI inflation at 7.39 per cent. In December 2019, it was 7.35 per cent,"" Chidambaram said.

""Food inflation stands at 14.12 per cent. Vegetable prices are up 60 per cent. Onion prices are over Rs 100 per kg. This is the 'achhe din' promised by the BJP,"" he said.

Rahul Gandhi to Address 'Yuva Aakrosh' Rally Over Issue of Unemployment in Jaipur on Tuesday,"Jaipur: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will address a rally in Jaipur on Tuesday to highlight the issues of economic distress and unemployment.

AICC general secretary in-charge of Rajasthan Avinash Pande and Deputy Chief Minister and PCC president Sachin Pilot on Monday reviewed the preparations for 'Yuva Aakrosh' rally at Ramnivas garden.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said the biggest problem that the youth today are facing is unemployment.

He said the employment crisis is worsening and the Centre in its upcoming budget should focus on creating new jobs and adopting policies that will make the industry thrive and provide employment to the people.

""Biggest issue today for youth is unemployment as ppl employed in different sectors hv bn facing redundancies in last 5 yrs. Job crisis is worsening. In next budget, Govt must focus on generating new jobs,on adopting policies wch allow industries to grow & increase number of staff (sic),"" the chief minister tweeted.

""Unemployment is growing in the country, we are all suffering because of rising inflation. Trade and industries are facing slowdown. Due to wrong policies of BJP government at the Centre, the country's economy is going down. The youth are feeling frustrated and angry (sic),"" he added.

During the rally, Gandhi is also likely to talk about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

The Rajasthan Assembly on Saturday passed a resolution urging the Centre to repeal the CAA. It is the second Congress-ruled state after Punjab to pass such a resolution.

""The central government is diverting public attention from the real issues and Gandhi will primarily focus on them in the rally,"" Deputy Chief Minister Pilot said.

Bring in National Register of Unemployment Youths Instead of NRC: Digvijaya Singh to Amit Shah,"Bhopal: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh here on Thursday asked Home Minister Amit Shah to bring in a National Register for Unemployed Youths instead of a National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Singh accused the RSS of diverting the attention of youths away from employment and engaging them in religious activities. ‚ÄúI ask the youth to fulfill their religious obligations, but urge them to not be carried away by the RSS,"" he said.

""I ask Amit Shah to bring in a National Register for Unemployed Youths,"" said Singh, questioning the requirement of an NRC as the government already has everyone‚Äôs data through Aadhaar and voter cards.

The former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister claimed that the amendment in the contentious citizenship law wasn‚Äôt required as the old Act had the provision of offering citizenship to anyone with a long-term visa of over 11 years.

‚ÄúLegislations like the NRC and the CAA are used to intimidate Muslims who have lost all hopes except for glimmer of hope from the judiciary,‚Äù he said.

Pointing to the massive unrest over the issues of NRC, CAA and the National Population Register (NPR), Singh accused the political fraternity of having lost control of the agitation, with students and the minority community taking over. Days ago, Singh had visited Shaheen Bagh, the iconic New Delhi protest site where thousands of Muslim women and kids have been staging a dharna for more than a month.",https://www.news18.com/news/politics/amit-shah-should-bring-in-national-register-of-unemployment-youths-instead-of-nrc-says-digvijaya-singh-2470719.html,
"No Correct System of Collecting Job Data, Says PM After Report Showed 45-Year Unemployment High","New Delhi: Facing criticism over lack of job creation by his government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday rejected allegations of rising unemployment and said crores of new jobs have been created in formal and unorganised sectors in the last four and half years.

Jobs have been created both in informal and formal sectors, he said in Lok Sabha, citing data from provident fund and National Pension System (NPS), Income Tax filings and sale of vehicles among others.

His defence came amid allegations of jobless growth, which has been highlighted by a leaked NSSO (National Sample Survey Office) report, which pegged unemployment at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, but has not been released since December. Two members of the National Statistics Commission had resigned over it, alleging that the government had suppressed it.

Replying to the debate on Motion of Thanks to the President's address to Parliament, Modi rejected the findings of the leaked report and said informal sector accounts for 85-90 per cent while the formal sector provides only 10-15 per cent employment in the country.

The Prime Minister said in 15 months till November 2018, 1.8 crore people got enrolled in the Employees Provident Fund for the first time. Of these 64 per cent were below 28 years of age.

As many as 65 lakh employees were part of NPS system in 2014 which has increased to 1.2 crore by October 2018. About 6.35 lakh new professionals have filed income tax returns in the last four year. ""Isn't this indication of job creation,"" the PM quipped on the repeated barbs of opposition leaders on employment situation in the country.

‚ÄúIn the past four years, there are more than 6 lakh new professionals in the country. Do you think when a doctor opens a clinic or a nursing home, he will only employ one person? Or a chartered accountant will only run his office by giving job to only one person? No. There is no logic to joblessness claim. There are more jobs in the unorganised sector,‚Äù he asserted.

With the general elections looming, the strong rebuttal assumes significance as jobs has been the number one concern of voters in most surveys conducted so far. In a survey by Firstpost and YouGuv India, roughly 70 per cent youth who will be first-time voters said jobs is their biggest demand from the next government.

Although the Prime Minister cited EPFO and other supplementary data to back up his claim of job creation, economists have frequently said failure to release the NSSO report was the latest sign of a complete lack of transparency regarding jobs data.

They said that the government‚Äôs decision to discontinue the NSSO‚Äôs five-year surveys, failure to regularly release Labour Bureau data and delay in releasing the NSSO‚Äôs periodic labour force survey had led to an atmosphere of uncertainty and confusion.

But the PM said there is no ‚Äúcorrect system‚Äù of collecting job data at present and his government is trying to put one in place.

Referring to the informal sector, he said, 36 lakh new large trucks/commercial vehicles, 1.5 crore passenger vehicles and 27 lakh new autos were sold. Have those been bought for parking, he asked, adding they are not included in the job data.

He said 1.25 crore opportunities were created in hotel industry, 1.5 crore in tourism, besides a large number of jobs have been created by cab aggregators and through Mudra scheme. Cab aggregators are app-based but vehicles are not ""driver-less,"" Modi said as he reeled out data on jobs created in different sectors.

He also took a jibe at previous non-BJP governments saying that in earlier times odd jobs created even in STD booths were cited in Parliament. The government has launched several initiatives like Skill India, Stand-Up India and Digital India aimed at promoting self-employment in the country.",https://www.news18.com/news/politics/no-correct-system-of-collecting-job-data-says-pm-modi-after-leaked-report-showed-45-year-unemployment-high-2029111.html,
"Depressed Over Unemployment, Delhi Man Kills Children Before Jumping in Front of Metro Train","New Delhi: A 44-year-old man allegedly killed his daughter and son before ending his life by jumping in front of a Delhi metro train at Haiderpur Badli Mor station on Sunday, police said.

No suicide note has been recovered, but police claimed that the man, Madhur Malani, was depressed since his sandpaper-manufacturing factory was closed some six months ago due to financial crunch leaving him jobless. Madhur's parents had been supporting his family financially since then.

He used to stay with his wife Rupali, daughter Samiksha (14) and six-year-old son Shraiyans at a rented house in northwest Delhi's Shalimar Bagh area, they said.

Rupali was not at home when Madhur strangled their children. He might have also smothered their daughter but the exact cause of death would be ascertained only after the post-mortem reports arrive, a police official said.

After killing his two children, he jumped in front of an approaching train at Haiderpur Badli Mor Metro station following which he was rushed to a hospital where doctors declared him 'brought dead', the official said.

Metro services on the Yellow Line were briefly delayed due to the incident.

""Delay in services from Samaypur Badli to GTB Nagar due to a passenger on track at Haiderpur Badli Mor,"" the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) tweeted.

After about 15 minutes, it again tweeted that normal services have been restored. The Delhi Metro's Yellow Line connects Samaypur Badli in Delhi to HUDA City Centre in Gurgaon.

The suicide was reported to the police around 5.40 pm while the Shalimar Bagh Police station received a call about the killings around 6.50 pm.

On reaching the house, police found bodies of the children lying in beds in two rooms. During enquiry, it was learnt that their father has left the house, a senior police officer said.

While police were trying to trace Madhur, they learnt about a suicide at the metro station. On verifying the details, it surfaced that Madhur committed suicide after killing his children, the officer said.

Rupali told police that she had gone to a nearby market around 3 pm and on returning home she found the bodies of her children while her husband was missing.

A case under relevant sections of the IPC has been registered and investigation was underway, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Northwest) Vijayanta Arya said.

"OPINION | Addressing Soaring Unemployment, Induce Higher Consumption: What to Expect from Union Budget 2019","The NDA Government‚Äôs first full-fledged Union Budget in its second term comes at a crucial juncture. The Indian economy has been passing through a difficult phase of late and the country is looking to the Budget to present a roadmap to recovery. The Finance Minister has her task cut out as she prepares to tackle sagging growth, soaring unemployment, and slackening consumption. Indeed, she must walk a tightrope ‚Äî balancing fiscal consolidation with necessary growth stimuli.

The current crisis can be traced to an unprecedented credit crunch with banks wary of lending due to bad experience with Non-performing Assets (NPAs). This has slowed down private investment and, in turn, job creation.

At the same time, dwindling disposable incomes have left consumers with lesser purchasing power, completing a vicious cycle. The Budget must look to build momentum for investment by making allocations for public capex, while also incentivising private investors. It must also address the employment issue and induce higher consumption to unshackle the economy. In order to revive the economy, I would like to see the FM target strategic interventions under the following broad heads:

Infrastructure is a critical sector as it generates derived demand besides being the second largest employer after agriculture. The government must increase budgetary allocations to maintain the momentum on construction of roads and highways. It must also earmark funds to expedite the completion of key projects like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, high-speed trains, expanding metro connectivity, and upgrading of ports. Fast-tracking the proposed dedicated freight corridors can be a game-changer for logistics. Extending tax holidays and simplifying land acquisition norms will help attract private investment. The government may consider issuing tax-free bonds for raising long-term capital to finance infrastructure projects.

Real estate is similar to infrastructure in having a multiplier effect on the rest of the economy, but has seen a pronounced slump in recent times. The government must look to rationalise the tax burden by subsuming stamp duty under the Goods and Service Tax (GST), restoring input tax credit and relaxing Minimum Alternate Tax (MAT), besides implementing a single-window clearance for developers. It must also inject liquidity by relaxing norms for Real Estate Investment Trusts and raising lending limits for Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs). Extending infrastructure status to the whole sector and relaxation of External Commercial Borrowing norms will also ease inflow of a capital. More direct tax sops to home buyers is likely to translate into increased sales.

Including power projects under investment-linked deductions scheme and restructuring of loans will provide huge relief to developers saddled with stressed assets. After a quiet Interim Budget, the renewables sector expects enhanced allocations for i) developing a Green Corridor to boost transmission, ii) strengthening the grid for smooth integration of RE, and iii) supporting emerging technologies like floating solar and storage.

Subsidies and tax incentives will help popularise rooftop solar installations. A crucial reform I expect the government to initiate is to restore financial and operational health of discoms so they can reduce losses, pay their dues timely and honour RPOs. The sector also awaits rationalisation and long-term clarity on GST.

I also expect a clear action plan for fast tracking usage of eco-friendly electric vehicles, including enhanced access to funds, tax credits and duty exemptions for manufacturers, subsidies for buyers and adequate charging infrastructure. Allocation of funds and tax incentives to encourage in-house R&D will further underline the government‚Äôs commitment to a cleaner future.

The Budget must also ring in the next generation of agricultural reforms to transform the rural economy, create more jobs and boost demand. Increased public expenditure on developing agri-infra like micro-irrigation, cold storage units, a national warehouse grid will help augment farm income. The government should also consider increased allocations for schemes such as MGNREGA and the Deen Dayal Grameen Kaushal Yojana.

This Budget should announce rationalisation of corporate and income tax rates. A universal reduction in corporate tax rate to 25% will generate an investible surplus, and bring tax rate in line with other major economies, thus enhancing our global competitiveness. Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) spend should be counted as expense and not under profits. Similarly, direct tax reforms will leave more money in hands of consumers and stimulate consumption and savings. The Budget would do good to announce tweaks such as raising basic exemption limit to Rs 5 lakh, upward revision of tax slabs, and enhancing investment limits under Sec 80C and 80D as well as deduction for interest on home loans.

To create more jobs, the government must design a programme where it identifies, invests in and incentivises sectors with maximum employment potential like food processing, textiles, construction, manufacturing, tourism and retail ‚Äì forming Special Economic Zones (SEZs) with subsidised land, tax holidays and import duty exemptions can be a preferred route. The Skill India initiative should also receive higher budgetary allocation as it makes people more productive and employable.

The Budget must also set aside funds for recapitalisation of banks as a healthy banking system alone can meet the demand for credit and keep the wheels of economy in motion. Progressive reduction of government stake in PSU banks will allow fresh infusion of funds and make them more efficient and autonomous. Strategic disinvestment can also be a source of funds for the government, and it can show positive intent by using the Budget to unveil a disinvestment schedule, targeting loss making PSUs and others with idle assets.

I hope the upcoming Budget will steer our economy back on the growth track, carry forward the reforms agenda, and set the foundation for a stable, forward looking policy environment. It is a great opportunity for a government which has only just received a mammoth mandate, to show it can deliver in tough situations, by lifting the economy out of troubled waters through a well-conceived mix of reforms and fiscal stimuli.

"In Last 2 Years, Unemployment Rose by 53%, Suicides 20 Fold in Madhya Pradesh: Berozgar Sena","Bhopal: Berozgar Sena, a voluntary outfit fighting unemployment in Madhya Pradesh refuted the government‚Äôs claims and said that unemployment has gone up by 53% in the last two years and unemployment-related suicides have surged 20 times between 2005 and 2015.

On Sunday, the outfit organized a ‚ÄòBerozgar panchayat‚Äô in Bhopal to unite the unemployed youth of the state to put forward their demands to BJP and Congress. The group also intends to ask these parties to address their issues in the election manifestos for the upcoming state elections.

On speaking about increasing suicides in the state, Berozgar Sena convener Akshay Hunka said, ‚ÄúMadhya Pradesh leads in unemployment-related suicides.‚Äù

Hunka claimed that against 57 lakh registrations at employment offices, barely 1% have received jobs so far in the last ten years and the 60,000 vacancies as advertised by the state government appeared only during the election year.

Hunka further added that there was a clear disparity between the unemployment figures compiled by the MP government and the actual unemployment figures in the state.

The organization alleged massive anomalies in government recruitment and rampant corruption in schemes meant for promoting entrepreneurship.

Giving a broad definition of unemployment, Hunka said if anyone completes BE and works at a call centre for Rs 10,000 per month, it‚Äôs also unemployment.

‚ÄúThrough our persistent campaigns and protests, we have at least managed to bring this problem before the mainstream society and political parties are now forced to talk about ways of giving youth jobs and vocational options,‚Äù claimed Hunka, who had formed the outfit after resigning from Aam Aadmi Party‚Äôs (AAP) state unit.

Former Samajwadi Party spokesperson, Pankhuri Pathak, who reached Bhopal to extend support to the cause, claimed that instead of working for youth political parties are dividing them based on their caste, which is also one of the reasons why she quit Samajwadi Party.

On being asked whether she agreed to the notion that reservation was hampering opportunities for deserving students, Pathak said she personally suffered due to the reservation system while pursuing a law degree at Delhi University.

Responding to a query whether she saw herself in MP politics, Pathak said she has been betrayed by the Akhilesh Yadav-led party and won‚Äôt be able to put faith in any other political party.

"Unemployment Rate at 6.1 Percent in 2017-18, Govt Cites New Survey in Rajya Sabha","New Delhi: Unemployment rate in the country as per a new survey was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the government informed Rajya Sabha on Wednesday. Minister of State for Labour Santosh Gangwar said the government is conducting a new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with new parameters and bigger sample size, and its results cannot be compared with previous surveys in this regard.

""As per the new Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by the government, the labour force participation is 36.9 per cent and the rate of unemployment for 2017-18 is 6.1 per cent,"" he said.

Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the minister said the report of this survey is very different than the surveys conducted in previous years.

This survey is not comparable to previous surveys, he said, adding it was an attempt to provide authentic data with the new survey conducted through the Ministry of Statistics.

""We are focusing on infrastructure development and ease of doing business and India's position in the world has improved. India has improved its position to 63rd rank now in 2019 against 196 in previous years,"" he said.

""Our government is very conscious of creating employment opportunities and is running such programme which generate employment.

""The way our government is functioning, employment opportunities are being created and the youths are getting jobs also,"" the minister said.

Gangwar said the government has stopped the previous survey as the sample size was low and an attempt is being made to improve the data by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.

The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also.

Unemployment Rate Among Women Engineers in India is Five Times Higher Than Men: Study,"New Delhi: Unemployment among women engineers in India is five times that of men and the rate has been increasing in many parts of the country, according to a study.

The study, which presented insights on the gender bias experiences of Indian women and men working for 'Western engineering companies' in India, suggested that both genders in the country experience high levels of bias, in different forms.

""Women are more likely to experience gender bias, while men face bias based on where they come from and their language spoken,"" said the report by The Society of Women Engineers in partnership with the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.

According to the study titled 'Walking the Tightrope', 44 per cent of men and 30 per cent of women engineers said they faced bias due to the state or region they are from.

The nationwide survey was conducted online beginning Fall 2017 among a cross section of 693 engineers across a variety of disciplines, engineering sectors and employment levels.

""The report underlines the bias problems that India's engineering workplace experiences. This is the tipping point. It is a call to action for organisations to address these pressing issues,"" said Neeti Sanan, faculty, Indian Institute of Management, Udaipur, and consultant to the SWE study.

According to the study, 76 per cent of engineers reported that they have to prove themselves over and over to get the same level of respect as their colleagues.

On the tug-of-war bias, it said 45 per cent of women reported that they have to compete with their female colleagues to get the one ""woman's spot"" available.

""We need to start thinking of women engineers as an integral part of organisations and treat them the way their male counterparts are treated,"" said Joan C Williams, founding director, Center for WorkLife Law at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.

The study said 11 per cent of women engineers and 6 per cent of men engineers reported unwanted romantic or sexual attention or touching in the workplace.

It further said despite the high level of bias that men tended to report, some significant gender differences emerged where women experienced higher levels of bias than men.

It said 45 per cent of women but only 28 per cent of men reported that it was perceived as inappropriate when women argued at work, even when it was work-related.

Rahul Gandhi grills PM Modi on unemployment,"New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday for not talking about the main issue of unemployment and ‚Äúdistracting‚Äù people by raising other things from Jawaharlal Nehru to Pakistan.

Responding to Modi after the Prime Minister replied to the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President‚Äôs Address in Lok Sabha, Gandhi said both the Prime Minister and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman have given long speeches in Parliament but have failed to reply on providing employment to youth.

He said, ‚ÄúAll youngsters of this country want that after studies school, college, university they get employment. We asked the Prime Minister repeatedly that you have given a one and a half hour speech and if for two minutes you can tell the youth about employment and what your government has done about it.‚Äù

He further added that earlier, the government used to talk about economy, Make in India, $5 trillion, but the Prime Minister now does not talk about the biggest issue facing the country and is distracting the people by talking about other things, ranging from the Congress and Nehru to Pakistan and Bangladesh.

New Delhi: The Congress on Sunday released its manifesto for Delhi polls, promising to implement an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000-7,500 per month and cashback schemes for water and power consumers if voted to power.

Presenting the manifesto, Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra said the party will provide free power up to 300 unit per month.

The manifesto also committed to spending 25 per cent budget each year on fighting pollution and improving transport facilities.

An unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 for graduates and Rs 7,500 for postgraduates per month will be provided under the Yuva Swabhiman Yojna, he said.

Congress will launch flagship cashback schemes for power and water supply to benefit consumers in saving these resources. The party, if voted to power, will open 100 Indira Canteens to provide subsidised meals at Rs 15, Chopra said.

Congress will challenge the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the Supreme Court and demand the Centre to withdraw the law. The party will also not implement the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the existing form of the National Population Register (NPR), if voted to power in Delhi.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/020220/cong-launches-manifesto-for-delhi-polls-focus-on-unemployment-cashba.html,
India's urban unemployment rate slows in March quarter: report,"The Indian government has in recent years faced public ire for not releasing comprehensive jobs data regularly.

New Delhi: India‚Äôs urban unemployment rate between January and March this year fell to 9.3 per cent, the lowest in at least four quarters, according to an unpublished government report reviewed by Reuters.

The numbers, recorded in the statistics ministry‚Äôs quarterly jobs report, could provide some relief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has faced criticism for not being able to create enough jobs amid slowing economic growth.

The urban unemployment rate of the January-March quarter compared with 9.9 per cent in the preceding quarter. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter‚Äôs rate is the lowest since then.

The report, which is likely to be published soon, did not assess rural unemployment.

The estimates were arrived at using the so-called ‚Äúcurrent weekly status‚Äù method which gives an average picture of unemployment in a short period of seven days preceding the survey period, the document said. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.

Joblessness among the youth - those aged between 15-29 years and who account for roughly over a third of India‚Äôs 1.3 billion people - was also marginally lower at 22.5 per cent in the quarter ending March 2019, from 23.7 per cent in the preceding quarter.

The Indian government has in recent years faced public ire for not releasing comprehensive jobs data regularly.

The first extensive annual report for the July 2017-June 2018 period, leaked in February and published in the Business Standard newspaper, showed unemployment rate was the highest in at least 45 years. Modi‚Äôs government officially released the report in May.

That month, the statistics department also released one set of quarterly urban unemployment reports that revealed data for April to December 2018. The latest report, reviewed by Reuters, contains jobs assessment for the first quarter of this year.

The fall in the unemployment rate, by weekly status methodology basis, came as employment among regular wage employees and a section of self-employed workers increased during the period, the statistics ministry report showed.

Still, the labour force participation rate - the percentage of population making up the labour force - which had slowly edged up between April and December last year, recorded a dip to 36 per cent during the March quarter, the report showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia‚Äôs third largest economy.

India‚Äôs economic growth fell to an over four-year low of 5.8 per cent in the January-March period. Subsequently, it fell further to 5 per cent in the following quarter.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/231119/indias-urban-unemployment-rate-slows-in-march-quarter-report.html,

"Economic growth seen slipping in April-June, more stimulus expected","The unemployment rate rose to 7.51 per cent in July from 5.66 per cent a year earlier. (Representational Image)

New Delhi: India‚Äôs economy likely expanded at its weakest pace in more than five years in April-June, a Reuters poll showed, as consumer demand and private investment weakened at a time global trade frictions have dampened business sentiment.

The median figure from the poll of economists is for annual growth in gross domestic product of 5.7 per cent in the quarter, compared with 5.8 per cent in the previous three months and 8 per cent for the same period of 2018.

If the latest number for expansion of gross domestic product is 5.7 per cent or less, the quarter had the slowest expansion in 21 quarters, since 5.3 per cent in January-March 2014.

‚ÄúEconomic growth is collapsing,‚Äù said Sunil Sinha, principal economist at India Ratings, the Indian arm of Fitch, noting that April-June likely was the fifth straight quarter of slowing since 8.1 per cent in the first three months of 2018.

He said the slowdown has been driven by a fall in household savings and banks‚Äô increased bad loans, which has hit private investment.

‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs economic slowdown could continue for next 2-3 years as the economy faces serious structural issues of a slowdown in consumer demand and decline in manufacturing growth,‚Äù Sinha said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government is taking steps to try to attract investment to combat the slowdown.

On Wednesday, he approved 100 per cent foreign investment in coal mining and eased rules for sectors including contract manufacturing and single brand retail.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sithraman is likely to announce more measures soon to support sectors such as auto - where July sales tumbled 31 per cent, the biggest decline in nearly two decades - and real estate.

Limited space for stimulus

But in spite of a windfall dividend to the government of nearly USD 21 billion from the central bank, the room for aggressive stimulus is limited due to slower growth in tax receipts, analysts say.

India could consider a ‚Äúmodest stimulus‚Äù for some sectors after the Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs hefty dividend while following fiscal discipline, said a senior government official, who declined to be named.

During April-June, the government‚Äôs capital spending fell 28 per cent from a year earlier to 630 billion rupees (USD 8.81 billion), partly due to restrictions on announcing new projects during the election campaign that took place in part of that period.

Industry chambers are lobbying for a cut in goods and services tax rate on passenger vehicles and cement to revive growth, warning that falling sales could force more job cuts.

The unemployment rate rose to 7.51 per cent in July from 5.66 per cent a year earlier, estimates the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a private think tank in Mumbai.

New Delhi is banking on continued support from the central bank, which this year has cut the benchmark repo rate by 110 basis points, while indicating it will further cut rates as inflation remains below its 4 per cent medium term target of 4 per cent.

The RBI‚Äôs monetary policy committee (MPC) next meets October 1-4.

However, analysts said one reason monetary stimulus will not be sufficient to revive growth is that debt-ridden banks are reluctant to pass on benefits, and largely using the space given by rate cuts to protect their loan margins.

‚ÄúBand aid kind of solutions are not going to help the economy. We should be prepared for growing below our potential of near 8 per cent growth for next two-three years,‚Äù said Sinha of India Ratings.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/290819/economic-growth-seen-slipping-in-april-june-more-stimulus-expected.html,

New Delhi: Launching yet another attack on the government, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday provoked the Centre to break its silence on job losses and closure of companies.

Sharing a collage of multiple Hindi newspaper articles, Vadra further sought accountability for the plunging economy.

Lucknow: Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Saturday said that the danger of economic slowdown was looming large over India and urged the Centre to take serious note of the prevailing economic condition.

Mayawati also said that businessmen are very distressed with the prevailing economic situation in the country and claimed that some of them are even forced to take extreme to commit suicide.

New Delhi: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Friday cited a media report to claim that jobs of 10 lakh people in the automobile sector were in danger and asserted that the BJP government's silence on job losses was ""most dangerous"".

Her remarks came after industry body ACMA on Wednesday said around 1 million jobs could be on the line if the prolonged slowdown in the automobile industry continues. Priyanka Gandhi tagged the media report on Twitter which said auto parts industry is fearing that 1 million jobs could be at stake due to the slowdown.

""Jobs of 10 lakh people working in the auto sector are in danger. People working in this sector will have to search for new job avenues,"" she said. ""The silence of the BJP government on job losses, weakening trade and policies damaging the economy is most dangerous,"" Priyanka Gandhi claimed.

The Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (ACMA), which represents the auto component industry that alone employs around 5 million people, has sought a uniform GST of 18 per cent for the entire automobile sector in order to revive the vertical which has now witnessed 10 months of continuous decline in sales.

ACMA president Ram Venkataraman had said considering the fact that the auto component industry grows on the back of the vehicle industry, a current 15-20 per cent cut in vehicle production has led to a crisis-like situation. ""If the trend continues, the layoffs are inevitable and an estimated 10 lakh people could be laid off,"" he said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/politics/260719/bjp-govts-silence-on-job-losses-most-dangerous-priyanka-gandhi.html,
"Corporatisation of railways' production units will bring jobs, investments: Goyal","Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday admitted that the government is moving towards corporatisation of its production units, including Rae Bareli Modern Coach Factory and said that the move will offer jobs, bring investments and ensure growth.

New Delhi: A day after Congress leader Sonia Gandhi raised the issue, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Wednesday admitted that the government is moving towards corporatisation of its production units, including Rae Bareli Modern Coach Factory and said that the move will offer jobs, bring investments and ensure growth.

Replying to supplementaries in Lok Sabha during Question Hour, he hit back at Gandhi, saying the party only made announcements and not a single coach was made till 2014.

""The production units that are being corporatised will offer jobs, bring investments, ensure growth, make good modern electric and aluminium coaches. To make all this happen, we will bring the corporates on board while the government stays the majority stakeholder,"" Goyal said.

The issue was raised by Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Wednesday, a day after Gandhi opposed the government's proposal to corporatise Rae Bareli Modern Coach Factory alleging that it was the ""first step"" towards their privatisation.

""Congress-run government didn't do corporatisation but privatisation. Congress government set up a coach factory and from 2008 to 2014, no coach was made. We made factory run and 1,422 coaches were made last year by this coach factory, giving employment to a number of people,"" he said.

Responding to the charges, Goyal said the charge by the Congress leader shows the grand old party's ""double standards.""

""Former finance minister during UPA regime had said that disinvestment and privatisation are useful economic tools. See this is their double standard. Congress created a private company and transferred the entire GST data to it and even majority stake was held by the private companies. However, under Narendra Modi ji's leadership, we created a government company in September 2018 for this purpose,"" he said.

"'India has wage problem, not job problem': Mohandas Pai","Pai suggested that India adopt the Chinese model of opening up labour-intensive industries and building infrastructure near coasts, besides investing heavily in hitech R&D to meet the aspirations of job-seekers. (Photo: File)

Bengaluru: Former Infosys CFO and multi-sector investor T V Mohandas Pai has said India does not face a job problem, but one of wages, as a lot of low paid jobs being created do not find favour with degree holders.

""India is not producing good jobs, but creating a lot of Rs 10,000-Rs 15,000 low-paid jobs which are not fancied by degree holders. India has a wage problem, not a job problem,"" he told PTI.

Also, India has regional and geographical problems, Pai said.

Pai suggested that India adopt the Chinese model of opening up labour-intensive industries and building infrastructure near coasts, besides investing heavily in hitech R&D to meet the aspirations of job-seekers.

""We should look at what China has done. They first opened up the labour intensive industry - invited the rest of the world to come and use its labour and started an export industry. We have not incentivised labour intensive industries. We don't have proper policies, so we cannot use our surplus labour,"" he said.

Pai pointed out that China has also invested heavily in hitech Research and Development in many areas, including electronic assembly and chip creation, by incentivising at lower level to create an eco-system.

""Thirdly, China built infrastructure near the coasts so that infrastructure and supply chain comes down. We have not built infrastructure around the coasts,"" he said.

Pai said the data on unemployment put out by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) that 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 was erroneous.

""There are flaws in the survey methodology for unemployment for the age group of 15 to 29 years,"" he said.

Pai said the best data on jobs was the EPFO payroll data, which says 60 to 70 lakh people get formal jobs every year.

Even vehicle sales throw light on the job situation in India, Pai said, adding that every year 30 to 35 lakh people get jobs after discounting vehicle purchases.

""For example, India buys about seven lakh tractors, six lakh autorikshaws, seven-and-a--half lakh trucks every year.

As many as 28 lakh cars are bought, of which five lakh may require drivers. The drivers create 30 to 35 lakh jobs every year,"" he said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/160619/india-has-wage-problem-not-job-problem-mohandas-pai.html,

Mumbai: BJP's largest ally Shiv Sena on Monday asked Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman to find a solution to the ""economic crisis"", citing the latest official data on slumping growth and rising unemployment.

Shiv Sena's comments came after the NSSO report, released on May 31, showed the GDP growth rate plunging to 5.8 per cent during the January to March quarter of the financial year 2018-19.

Recalling the Modi government's promise to create two crore jobs annually after it came to power in 2014, the editorial said, ""In 2015-16, over 37 lakh job positions were vacant, but only 1.48 people were recruited.

Slump in economic growth and unemployment 2 major challenges: Congress,"The country's fiscal deficit in 2018-19 stood at 3.4 per cent of GDP, roughly in line with the Interim Budget estimate. (Photo: PTI)

New Delhi: The Congress on Friday said the slump in economic growth and unemployment are two important challenges before the country and expressed the hope that the new government would address these issues.

""Slump in 'economic growth' & Runaway 'unemployment' are two important challenges before the country. Hope PM & FM will address them by laying a short-medium-long term roadmap of kick starting the growth engine as also employment generating strategy,"" he tweeted after CSO reported that the economic growth rate for the financial year 2018-19 stood at a five-year low of 6.8 per cent.

Real GDP or GDP at constant (2011-12) prices is now estimated at Rs 140.78 lakh crore. The GDP growth estimate during FY 19 was revised to 7 per cent as compared to 7.2 per cent in 2017-18.

During January to March quarter, the growth slipped to a low of 5.8 per cent, mainly due to a slowdown seen in key sectors like agriculture, industry, and manufacturing in the past nine months. The number was below the forecast of 6.5 per cent for the March quarter.

The country's fiscal deficit in 2018-19 stood at 3.4 per cent of GDP, roughly in line with the Interim Budget estimate. Spending during the financial year was Rs 23.1 lakh crore against the revised target of Rs 24.1 lakh crore.

Meanwhile, the rate of growth in eight core infrastructure industries during April came to 2.6 per cent against 4.9 per cent in the previous month. The combined index stood at 127.5 in April 2019 with cumulative growth during April to March 2018-19 at 4.3 per cent.

The slowdown reached a high point with the country's industrial output touching a 21-month low in March. Factory output as measured in terms of the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had grown by 5.3 per cent in March 2018, according to the CSO data.

New Delhi: Exit polls after the end of India‚Äôs general election on Sunday showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies retaining power with an overwhelming majority.

The Hindu nationalist leader will need to tackle a host of issues ranging from unemployment to weak economic growth:

JOBS

Creating work for an estimated 1.2 million young people entering the market each month will be a key challenge. Economists say the next prime minister will need to encourage businesses to step up investment to create job opportunities.

Unemployment rose to 7.6 per cent in April, the highest since October 2016, and up from 6.71 per cent in March, data from private think-tank the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed.

An official survey that was withheld by the government showed India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent, the highest level in at least 45 years, in 2017-18, the Business Standard newspaper reported in January.

ECONOMY

Economic growth, which hit a five-quarter low of 6.6 per cent in October-December, appears to be slowing further. Car and motorbike sales have tumbled and industrial output contracted for the first time in nearly two years in March. Rural demand and manufacturing growth have also weakened.

Economists have also questioned the quality of the official economic data, saying the on-the-ground situation is far bleaker.

The new government will have limited options to boost the economy given the prevalent revenue constraints - it may need to rework its expenditure plans and deploy more funds to schemes that can help boost weak consumption in rural areas.

The government will also need support through rate cuts and liquidity measures from the Reserve Bank of India to help bring down cost of funds for banks and make loans cheaper for consumers.

TRADE

India‚Äôs trade relationship with major partners, including the United States and China, remains on a shaky footing.

US President Donald Trump‚Äôs administration has called out India on its high tariffs, price caps on imported US medical devices and rules around e-commerce trade.

Indian government officials say they fear Trump‚Äôs administration will soon end preferential trade treatment for India, which allows duty-free entry for up to USD 5.6 billion worth of its exports to the United States.

Adding to India‚Äôs troubles is the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China, which is likely to benefit countries such Japan and South Korea. India remains vulnerable to dumping of cheap Chinese imports.

PAKISTAN

National security issues and relations with arch-rival Pakistan will be high on agenda. Tension between the nuclear-armed neighbours has been high after Modi this year sent warplanes into Pakistan to avenge the killing of 40 Indian police officers in a militant attack which was claimed by a Pakistan-based group.

In recent weeks, Pakistani leaders have suggested that they are tired of conflict, opposed to extremism and open to peace talks with India, but those offers have been met with scepticism.

India is steadfast in its demand that Islamabad stop its support for militant groups, particularly those operating in the disputed Kashmir region, and has said it isn‚Äôt open to talks until then.

RELIGION

Allies of Modi‚Äôs BJP will likely renew their controversial demand to build a Hindu temple on the ruins of a 16th century mosque in the northern town of Ayodhya.

A violent Hindu mob destroyed the mosque in Ayodhya in 1992, triggering riots that killed about 2,000 people in one of the worst episodes of sectarian violence since independence from colonial rule in 1947.

India‚Äôs Supreme Court has set up a panel to arbitrate the decades-long dispute.

Modi could also end the special constitutional status given to India‚Äôs only Muslim-majority state, Jammu and Kashmir, as the BJP believes the status prevents outsiders from buying property there and hinders its integration with the rest of India.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/economy/200519/as-election-dust-settles-jobs-trade-security-high-on-governments-t.html,

Sitting outside a coaching institute here, several groups of 18 to 25-year-old job aspirants are busy discussing notes from the previous class. The discussion turns into a political debate at the mention of Lok Sabha elections and unemployment ‚Äî a dominant theme of the electoral discourse. There are around 14,000 registered unemployed people in Bikaner alone, according to data provided by the National Career Service (NCS).

However, many young job seekers feel Prime Minister Narendra Modi should return to power and employment generation should not be the only measure of the BJP government‚Äôs performance. Sukhdev Singh (18) shrugs at the mention of lack of jobs in India and goes on to explain vociferously why the country needs Modi. ‚ÄúSo what if there are no jobs? How much can a single man do? And Modi ji has still done a lot for the country.

It‚Äôs not like there are no jobs, those who study hard do find jobs,‚Äù Singh, who is preparing for the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) exams, told PTI. According to the NCS, about 6 lakh people in Rajasthan were jobless till March 2019, with only 27,920 job vacancies. Singh, who will vote the first time on May 6 from Kolayat near Bikaner, said, ‚ÄúToday, the country is globally recognised and the last five years have seen more development than 70 years under the Congress.‚Äù Amit Chaudhary (19) echoed Singh‚Äôs sentiments.

‚ÄúWho says there are no or not enough jobs? There are enough jobs right now and more are coming. As far as I know, nobody can stop Modi ji from coming back to power. Plus, who is going to face him?‚Äù Chaudhary asked. Sanwarlal Bhargav feels getting jobs is harder due to increased competition. ‚ÄúThose who are preparing for SSC also appear for Rajasthan LDC (lower divisional clerk) exams, this shoots up the cut-off for the latter.

"After demonetisation, 50 lakh lost jobs over 2 years: Report","A government report which was leaked in January this year also recorded that the unemployment rate in India rose to a 45-year high in 2017-2018. (Representational image)

Mumbai: As per a report released on Tuesday by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University, almost 50 lakh people lost their employment between 2018 and 2019 after November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes would not be considered as legal tender.

As per the report, the beginning of the decline in employment rate coincides with the government‚Äôs note ban in 2016 but no ""causal link"" can be built up based on the information, says the report titled ‚ÄòState of Working India 2019‚Äô.

The employment losses are higher when women are taken under consideration. The women workforce participation has also lowered, the report said.

According to the report, ""Whether or not this decline was caused by demonetisation, it is definitely a cause for concern and calls for urgent policy intervention,""

A government report which was leaked in January this year also recorded that the unemployment rate in India rose to a 45-year high in 2017-2018.

The overall unemployment rate was pegged at around 6 per cent in 2017-2018, according to the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO) Periodic Labour Force Survey, held between 2017 and 2018.

But NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said the report was ""not verified"" and the ""veracity of the data was not known"".

The report said unemployment has largely been driven by higher-educated men in both urban and rural areas, those in the age group of 20 to 24.

""Clearly, there is a large differential impact by level of education. This is consistent with the idea that the informal sector, where we can expect the share of less educated men to be higher, was hit hardest by demonetisation as well as the introduction of GST,"" the report noted.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/170419/after-demonetisation-50-lakh-lost-jobs-over-2-years-report.html,
"From farms to slums, Indian women on sharp end of jobs crisis","Indian women sometimes do not take jobs far from home due to fears for their safety. (Representational image)

Mumbai: A few years ago, in this sweltering corner of western India, the horizon was dotted with hunched, barefoot women swinging sickles all day to cut wheat for the spring harvest.

Now, a giant green harvester clears an entire half-acre field within minutes, allowing farmers to save money and quickly sell the wheat, typically used to make Indian flat breads.

Chhaya Kharade, 36, and other women doing lighter farm work were gradually replaced by the machines that now crisscross wheat, sugar cane and onion fields surrounding Chincholi, a village 190 km (120 miles) east of India‚Äôs financial hub of Mumbai.

‚ÄúI should be busy now, as the wheat harvesting is going on. But there is hardly any work for me. Almost all farmers are using machines,‚Äù Kharade said in her spartan two-room house.

Indian women, especially those working in precarious informal sectors, are at the sharp end of what economists and opposition politicians describe as a jobs crisis in India. According to the private Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), 90 per cent of around 10 million jobs lost last year were held by women.

Several unemployed women interviewed by Reuters said they had soured on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a Hindu nationalist who swept to power in 2014 vowing to turn India into an economic powerhouse but has struggled to create jobs.

While Modi remains the favourite in general elections that kick off next month, insufficient employment - despite India‚Äôs roughly 7 per cent economic growth rate - is a major voter worry.

‚ÄúModi‚Äôs government has not done anything to create employment in this region. We would like to vote for a party that will set up factories and create jobs,‚Äù said Mumtaj Mulani, a 40-year-old woman who was plucking weeds from a pearl millet field in the area. She said she usually struggles to find work due to the spread of machines.

The dwindling female labour participation rate could have far-reaching implications for India‚Äôs economic development and the progress of women‚Äôs rights in the often deeply conservative country.

‚ÄúWhen nearly fifty per cent of the labour force is unable to live up to its potential, India is foregoing significant growth, investment, and productivity gains,‚Äù said Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia programme at the Carnegie Endowment.

‚ÄúThe social costs, while less tangible, are nevertheless acute,‚Äù Vaishnav added, noting research suggests women‚Äôs economic empowerment reduces inequality and ensures women have a greater voice in society.

Measuring the problem is tricky, and Modi‚Äôs government has delayed the release of controversial jobs data.

But the official report, leaked to local newspaper Business Standard in February, shows the female labour participation rate was merely 23.3 per cent in 2017-2018, down about 8 percentage points from 2011-2012.

Private estimates are gloomier. CMIE puts the figure at just 10.7 per cent between May and August 2018.

DOUBLE WHAMMY: NOTE BAN AND GST

To be sure, the loss of jobs to machines is a global issue, but Indian women have a more limited range of alternative work than their male counterparts. And in family-focused India, women across economic lines often quit work after getting married or having children.

Also, as some families‚Äô earnings rise, more women can afford to become caregivers.

Still, when compared to nations with similar income levels, India‚Äôs female labour participation rate is ‚Äúa distinct outlier,‚Äù according to Vaishnav.

Economists say Modi‚Äôs two signature economic policies - a ban on high-value banknotes in 2016 and the implementation of a national sales tax rate (GST) in 2017 - have hurt women more than men because they are more likely to be employed in vulnerable, informal workplaces.

Demonetisation thrust the informal, cash-based economy into turmoil. A year later, many small businesses went under, unable to deal with GST‚Äôs complexities or rate increases.

‚ÄúIf there are fewer jobs available, who will move out? The women will move out, because they get lower wages. The men will go compete for the few jobs,‚Äù said CMIE‚Äôs CEO Mahesh Vyas.

In Dharavi, a Mumbai slum that is one of Asia‚Äôs largest, 33 year-old Farzana Begum has struggled to provide for her five children since the workshop she stitched buttons for shut shop in the wake of GST.

‚ÄúI have stopped all extra spending on clothes and good food,‚Äù said Begum. ‚ÄúIf you ask anyone in Dharavi, everyone has seen a fall in income, lost their jobs or seen factories close after GST.‚Äù

Her dismay was echoed on the other side of the country, in a village near Kolkata, where Nuren Nesa‚Äôs earnings from embroidering saris fell from 700 rupees a week to 300 after demonetisation. Following GST, work ground to a halt and her embroidery machine is gathering dust.

‚ÄúModi‚Äôs note ban and GST measures have destroyed our source of income,‚Äù said Nesa, 41, who withdrew her son from university because tuition fees grew out of reach.

‚ÄúI will vote for the leader who will help us out with proper work and income,‚Äù she added.

As the battle for women‚Äôs votes heats up, Modi has pointed to programmes to provide toilets and subsidised cooking gas cylinders as evidence his administration cares for women. This month, the main opposition party, Congress, vowed to reserve a third of federal government jobs for women if elected.

HARD WORK TO HIRE WOMEN?

Some business owners say they receive few applications from women.

‚ÄúWe do not find too many women in the segment we service, even though we would like to hire more women because they are more sincere, there is less attrition and they can multi-task,‚Äù said Vineet Pandey, who owns Mumbai-based housekeeping firms Kaarya Facilities & Services and Hecqo.com.

Indian women sometimes do not take jobs far from home due to fears for their safety.

Call centres or factories run by multinationals often attract women workers by providing transport after late shifts, but working at many other jobs entails commutes on packed trains and buses through India‚Äôs teeming and cities.

One businessman who employees roughly 1,000 men at his chemical factory in southern India, says hiring women would mean providing separate bathrooms and transport at night.

He argues bypassing men would also stoke tensions in India, where economic transformations and an influx of technology are testing the social fabric.

‚ÄúIn the rural areas, it is a more patriarchal society, if we give jobs to women and not men, there will be complaints from men,‚Äù said the businessman, who asked to remain anonymous.

‚ÄúIt is to maintain harmony.‚Äù

In any case, it is a moot point for now. His plant, struggling with high costs of power and transport, is not hiring.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/200319/from-farms-to-slums-indian-women-on-sharp-end-of-jobs-crisis.html,
"Unemployment rate highest in 45 years, shows Centre‚Äôs ‚Äòburied‚Äô: report","The survey is the first on employment by a government agency since demonetisation.

New Delhi: India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high during 2017-2018, the Business Standard newspaper on Thursday quoted a government survey as showing, in the latest setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi just months before a tightening election.

The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent, the highest since 1972-73, Business Standard reported.

The survey has become a political issue after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the job data resigned saying there was delay in its release.

The head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission PC Mohanan said on Wednesday that he and colleague J Meenakshi were unhappy at the non-publication of jobs data that had been due for release in December and alleged interference by other state agencies over backdated GDP data.

Business Standard said the report showed that joblessness stood at 7.8 per cent in urban areas compared with 5.3 parts in the countryside.

The data is significant because this was the first comprehensive assessment of the employment situation conducted after Modi‚Äôs decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country‚Äôs banknotes from circulation overnight, the report said.

India‚Äôs economy has been expanding by 7 per cent plus annually -- the fastest pace among major economies -- but the uneven growth has meant there are not enough jobs created for millions of young Indians entering the workforce each year. This has put pressure on Modi as he seeks to retain power in a general election due by May.

Earlier this month, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a leading independent think-tank, said the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/310119/unemployment-rate-highest-in-45-years-shows-centres-buried.html,
‚ÄòRush for govt jobs doesn‚Äôt mean lack of job opportunities‚Äô: Piyush Goyal,"New Delhi: Job security irrespective of performance is the attraction of government jobs, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said on Tuesday, adding that the sheer volume of those who apply for such jobs should not be seen as lack of other job opportunities in the country.

Goyal and Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar were speaking at a CII workshop on jobs and livelihoods. They said the government has provided enough jobs in the last five years; however, data sources were unable to adequately capture this trend.

Javadekar remarked that people who do not work out of choice cannot be considered 'unemployed'.

Citing the example of railways where 15 million applications are received for a handful of posts, the railway minister said such data is often used to highlight high rate of unemployment.

""The attraction and lure of government jobs in the traditional Indian context is extremely huge. People think if they get a government job, they are sorted for life....they are permanent and, even if they misbehave and are found to be not good at their work, it does not matter, the unions will take care of them. That is the reality,"" Goyal said.

The minister, however, noted that alternative job opportunities have increased and new sectors were encouraging self-employment, which was not being captured in any labour data.

Indicating that there was a need to change and upgrade government systems, Goyal said the process of appraisal in government wherein the appraisee is shown his performance review defeats the purpose of an ""honest"" review.

""In this system, I have to work with someone throughout the year and I am writing their appraisal and handing it back to them. This goes down the line till the bottom of the pyramid. What can I write in that? I have to work with the same person throughout the year.‚Äù

""I am expected to give an honest appraisal and hand it to him and still continue to work with him and get the best out of him. This is something on which deliberations are needed,"" he said.

Javadekar also said there was a need to collect authentic data and pointed out that as of now only those in the organised sector were accounted for.

""There is no system to collect data from unorganised sector, the self-employed and also a large section of female population who by choice do not work. Are they unemployed? There are various aspects to this that need to be looked into,"" he said. The HRD minister also said there was a need to understand the ""craze for government jobs"". ""We have to find out why people with post graduate degrees apply for sweepers job in government,"" he said.

Goyal seconded Javadekar's viewpoint and said it needed to be deliberated why a person wanted to join the government sector. ""Is it because of lack of opportunities or a certain section sees this as a very 'safe, secure and permanent' employment irrespective of how good or bad the person is at work?"" the railway minister said.

He rued, ""Although instances of misdemeanour come to our notice, we are unable to take action because of the difficult system created"".",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/150119/rush-for-govt-jobs-doesnt-mean-lack-of-job-opportunities-piyush-goyal.html,
Unemployment major challenge for India but reforms would create jobs: IMF,"IMF said that the reforms being carried out for the past few years might help create jobs. (Photo: File | AFP)

New Delhi/Washington: Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Thursday exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country.

""Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,"" the IMF spokesperson, Gerry Rice, told reporters at a news conference in Washinton.

Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards.

""Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,"" Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth.

In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. ""We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,"" he said.

And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India's long-term growth but create jobs as well, Rice said.

""So we think, all of this will help to spur India's continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,"" Rice said.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/300318/unemployment-major-challenge-for-india-reforms-would-create-jobs-imf.html,
India‚Äôs unemployment rate jumps at 15-month high: CMIE,"The number of persons unemployed and are actively looking for a job almost touched 31 million in the week ended February 25, it said. This is the highest count of unemployed since October 2016.

New Delhi: In a major headache for the Modi government, India‚Äôs unemployment rate jumped to highest rate in last 15 months in February as there are still not enough jobs after 15 months of demonetisation, according to Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

The number of persons unemployed and are actively looking for a job almost touched 31 million in the week ended February 25, it said. This is the highest count of unemployed since October 2016.

"Layoffs still commonplace in India, IT sector worst-hit: report","Even as the economy grows, job layoffs continue to remain a ""commonplace"" with the automation prone information technology industry employees experiencing more pain than the others.

Mumbai: Even as the economy grows, job layoffs continue to remain a ""commonplace"" with the automation prone information technology industry employees experiencing more pain than the others, a report said on Friday.

The report comes amid fears of 'jobless growth' being witnessed in the country at present.

""Even as the economy improves, layoffs - due to cost cutting, reducing redundancies after a merger or acquisition, and restructuring events due to changes in the industry - remain commonplace,"" career transition company Risesmart said in a report after interviewing 1,000 executives.

""The survey concluded that employees in the IT sector experienced more layoffs in comparison to employees in other industries,"" a statement issued here said.

It, however, did not elaborate by quantifying the responses across sectors. In May last year, the then Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya had confirmed fears of the 'jobless growth' by stating that the economic growth was not translating into rise in employment opportunities.

""The current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it... growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,"" he had said.

The government and the ruling party had later explained that jobs created in sectors such as tourism and aviation were not counted for the purpose. In the statement, Risesmart said India has been one of the biggest employment creators globally but hiring has ""plummeted"" recently and the spectre of job layoffs is hitting both big and small companies.",https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/130418/layoffs-still-commonplace-in-india-it-sector-worst-hit-report.html,
"Employability in India touches new high of 47%, engineers most employable: Report","Percentage of employable population in the country grew to a new high of 47 per cent this year, an increase of almost 2-3 percentage points since last year, with engineers being the most employable class, a report said Thursday.

The employability rose by 14 percentage points in the last five years, from 33 per cent in 2014, according to India Skills Report, a joint initiative of Wheebox, PeopleStrong and the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).

Around 57 per cent of the final-year engineering graduates were found to be employable, an increase of about five percentage points since last year, the report said.

The employability amongst masters of business administration (MBA) graduates, however, has dropped by three percentage points over last year, the report said, without specifying the exact number.

""It seems that with exponential increase in the number of MBA colleges, the quality of talent is seen to be declining,"" it added.

The report also found that there has been a drop in employability of bachelor of pharmacy (BPharma) graduates.

Among the states, Andhra Pradesh topped the list with highest employability, followed by Rajasthan and Haryana, which have made their entry into the top 10 ranking for the first time. Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Punjab moved out from the top 10 list this year.

There has been an increasing presence of employable talent in tier-II and III cities, according to the report.

""This trend can be seen in spite of lack of big institutions such as IITs and IIMs or any other renowned institutes in tier II and III cities,"" it added.

Wheebox founder and chief executive officer Nirmal Singh said the employability touching 47 per cent is good sign for the market.

Why food delivery boys in India can earn more than PhDs,"Two seemingly unconnected bits of news made me sit up this week -- and between them they show contrasting views of India, its society, its state of education and its economy.

As many as 81,700 graduates have applied for the post of a messenger (commonly known as peons) in Uttar Pradesh police, and among them, hold your breath, are 28,000 post-graduates and even 3,700 PhD holders. The qualification officially required for the job is just primary school education.

The common view is that this reflects the state of unemployment in the country. But I would beg to differ. Why would 81,700 graduates queue up for 62 posts that involve a monthly salary of only Rs 20,000? I think the reasons run deeper. Based on a general observation for decades of how things work -- or don't -- in India, I think it is a reflection of the poor state of education and outlook towards jobs in a substantial part of Indian culture.

My take: In India, people want a job but no work. They want a permanent salary in a secure employment.

It is common in India to see matrimonial ads that speak of ""permanent jobs"" because that secures a lifelong arrangement without fear of being sacked. If it is a government job, that includes a pension. And it is common knowledge that there is in government jobs a scope for oopar ki aamdani (extra income), which is a euphemism for bribes or goodies. Loans are easier when you have a government job. Of course, marriage proposals flow in for men, and with them comes the prospect of a fat dowry.

It is commonsensical to ask: If there are graduates and post-graduates looking for a job, why can't they apply for call centre positions? Turns out in terms of pay there is not much difference, while working the phones as cold-callers or cranky customers may mean a lot more work than being a police peon.

Salary tracking site Payscale.com says a call centre customer service executive in India earns an average salary of around Rs 200,000 per year. There are some bonus and other payments that yield about Rs 40,000 more. Guess what? The final average monthly figure of about Rs 20,000 is the same as what a messenger in UP Police would get. You can say with certainty from posters and ads in India's leading cities that call centre jobs are aplenty. You can also guess why a peon's job in Lucknow may be preferred to that of a call-centre worker in Noida.

According to the substantially implemented recommendations of the 7th Pay Commission, a central government peon gets a starting salary of Rs 21,000 a month.

It seems a peon's job may make more sense for someone whose educational qualifications are mostly on paper and/or someone who looks for a permanent salary with less work, than someone who has to slog to earn commissions -- such as a call centre worker.

Now, there is another industry that is booming in India - e-commerce. Food delivery startup Foodpanda said last week that it is planning to hire as many as 60,000 food delivery assistants over a mere two months. That is nearly 1,000 times the number of jobs advertised by UP police, which has decided to postpone its recruitment because of the overload of overqualified applicants!

Foodpanda promises to pay around Rs 25,000 a month to the delivery riders -- more than the average call centre worker who can boast of air-conditioned offices and white collars but not necessarily higher pay. In some areas like Hyderabad recruitment data suggests delivery boys/girls may get as much as Rs 40,000 a month.

The salary may be well deserved. My guess is that it takes a lot more smartness to be a Foodpanda delivery rider than a messenger in UP Police. You need to work longer, negotiate traffic jams, deal with difficult customers, meet deadlines and achieve targets. The peon in UP Police may well get a 'hafta' that may surpass a framed ""Employee of the Month' certificate that the Foodpanda rider can boast of from his HR department. But how does pride compare with a hafta or a dowry?

Foodpanda and other e-commerce companies are trying to change the work culture in India. For now, both the sarkari culture and the digital age culture co-exist.

I am being a bit cynical here, but the UP and Foodpanda statistics, if true, only confirms the belief that in India, educational qualifications often involve learning by rote, clearing dubious exams in vague hinterland universities, not being acquainted with sufficient employable skills and above all, not being serious about having a real career.

It would take a while for culture to change.

"Indians accept lower paying jobs if they have to travel more for work, says research","New Delhi: A new research reveals that 43 per cent of business travellers in India would accept a lower paying job if it meant they could travel more for work as compared to 30 per cent globally.

Commissioned by Booking.com for Business, the global leader in connecting business travellers with the widest choice of places to stay, the research shows that company bosses are potentially under-valuing business travel as a staff remuneration ""bargaining chip"" as well as a workforce motivation and retention tool, said a statement.

The findings also reflect a broader trend identified by Booking.com for Business which reveals that employees are increasingly smudging the line between business and leisure.

According to data, more than half of Indian business travellers(67 per cent) have extended their business trips, to a different city or country in the past 12 months.

The statistics indicate that this trend in India is higher as compared to the global findings (49 per cent).

Where nearly one third of Indian business travellers (48 per cent) are claiming that they intend to do the same in 2017, only 27 per cent claim the same globally.

Additionally, 69 per cent of Indian travellers surveyed, believe that they will travel more for business in 2017 than they did in 2016, as versus a global finding of 46 per cent.

Ripsy Bandourian, Director of Product Development, Booking.com for Business said: ""No longer seen as lost time or a career inconvenience, business travel is increasingly seen as an opportunity to expand horizons, find inspiration and progress in a career.""

""Today's laptop and latte breed of employee is increasingly mobile and fluid with their travel plans, looking to strike a balance between business and leisure travel,"" Bandourian said.

""As such, they expect employers to keep pace with their need for greater fluidity and flexibility and are even prepared to negotiate on salary to do so.""

'India failed to occupy space vacated by China on jobs front',"New Delhi: India could not take advantage of job opportunities vacated by China in sectors like textile, gems & jewellery and leather in absence of appropriate policies, a top Labour Ministry official said.

""Jobs in manufacturing such as textile, gems and jewellery and leather that were vacated by China, we could not take advantage of that.

""And that went to countries like Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, Bangladesh primarily becuase...We did not have appropriate policies for those sectors, be it textiles, gems and jewellery, leather and like that,"" Labour Secretary Shankar Aggarwal said at a seminar on Compliance of Labour Legislations-Issues and Concern.

He said job opportunities in these sectors will aid in growth, encourage setting up large number of enterprises and help in exports of related products.

India added about 10 million people into the workforce earlier, however, now about 5-7 million join the workforce, as growth in the past few years has mainly been ""jobless"".

""If we got to create jobs, we got to encourage services sector as well as manufacturing. We were adding almost 10 million people every year in the workforce. This number has come down.

However, today we are adding only five-seven million people every year,"" Aggarwal said.

Aggarwal said it is necessary to create many jobs at every level and to create a mechanism to ensure and encourage people to create more jobs.

OECD last week had forecast China grow at 6.8 percent in 2015.

""The deceleration reflects the restructuring underway in the Chinese economy as services replace manufacturing and real estate investment as the main driver of growth,"" the think tank said.",https://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/india-failed-to-occupy-space-vacated-by-china-on-jobs-front_128291.html,
Thriving industries look to fill jobs with skilled labour,"Job growth is slated to be in double digits for many sectors and most of the cities indicate good times for employees. Prachi Rege chats with Neeti Sharma‚Äì Senior Vice President, TeamLease Services, about the hiring trends, new skills in the market place and popularity of temporary jobs in India

What are the current trends in recruitment and hiring?

Improved macro-economic conditions coupled with India Inc‚Äôs plans to ramp up capacity and enter new markets seems to be having a positive impact on the hiring sentiments. Job growth is slated to be in double digits for many sectors and most of the cities indicating good times for employees. While the demand for mid level talent is on the lower side, the biggest gainer in the coming half year (Oct ‚Äô14 ‚Äì Mar ‚Äô15) will be the junior and senior level profiles with a five and four per cent increase respectively. A larger chunk of hiring continue to happen at the bottom of the pyramid. While the industry hiring is looking up, the requirements for skilled labour has been on the rise and will continue to be so for job seekers with functional expertise.

Which industries have an upward trend in recruitment?

The industries which are seeing an upward job growth rate is the Information Technology, FMCD and Healthcare Banking & Financial Sector, Telecom, Retail and Pharmaceuticals. The top gaining cities across these sectors are Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and Ahmedabad.

What common skills and qualities are recruiters across fields looking for?

Employers‚Äô need for newer, and more sophisticated skills is accelerating. Job seekers also aim to be equipped with the latest skills. However, most of our education institutes do not prepare them for job. The gap that separates the two consists of institutional inadequacies that empower candidates with technological and market-focused capabilities. Employers are also placing more emphasis on soft skills and team / collaborative skills and leveraging technological tools that enable hiring right-fit skills at scale. Candidates, on the other hand, are increasingly demanding of workplace environs that nurture their unique capabilities.

Which industry is suffering the most from the problem of skill gap? Why?

Industry, has had its share of challenges in getting their positions filled. Not only have they lowered their hiring standards at the bottom of the pyramid in order to be fully staffed, they have established training programmes to make their hires productive. But this situation is unsustainable because it wrecks productivity and there is not a viable model for employers to ‚Äòmanufacture‚Äô their own employees. Almost all industries feel there is a skill gap between the defined job role and the job seekers‚Äô skills. Job Seekers‚Äô knowledge is based on theoretical skills and lack practical knowledge.

Since most of the hiring is happening at bottom of the pyramid and that too largely for sales jobs, industries such as Banking and Financial, Telecom, Retail and FMCG take the hit. On the other hand, manufacturing industries too are in dire need for technicians who are skilled on latest technology and equipment. Most of the entry level hires in the manufacturing industries happen through ITIs, however the ITI students are not equipped with the right skills for use of tools and techniques.

What is the trend in temporary recruitment? Is it popular in India, where people prefer stable jobs?

Since we are in the midst of the festive season (Sept ‚Äì Jan) , the trend of hiring temp staff has been gradually increasing and as and when volumes of companies grow, the temporary staffing numbers are expected to grow rapidly. For instance, the e-commerce industry alone has added around one lakh temporary jobs for the present quarter as compared to only 30,000 last year. However, the trend of temp staffing is still at its nascent stage and still has a long way to go. Most job seekers in India still look out for permanent jobs with a belief that it would be more stable than a temporary one. However, that is not the case anymore across most industries. Companies are moving into testing waters and then hiring the right fit. This has opened up more temp jobs and people taking these up considering that it‚Äôs better to be employed as a temp rather than being unemployed. On the other hand, there are certain roles, especially in the middle and senior levels where employees have been opting for temporary recruitment.

Is there an ideal assessment tool to monitor productivity at workplace? Please explain.

Workplace productivity is all about achieving maximum profits with minimum efforts and expenses. There is no one tool to assess productivity at workplace. Generic productivity and behavioral assessment tools are available in the market, but not specific to measuring output. In order to monitor productivity in a workplace various strategies need to be put in place, they are as follows:

Inquiring how well the employees they‚Äôre going

Creating objective as well as a subjective measurement scales for the various activities and tasks

Capturing the multi-dimensional nature of the skills your employees

'Rate of employment in 20 years lower than economic growth rate',"New Delhi: The rate of employment in the last two decades has been lower than economic growth rate and the quality of employment, government said on Thursday.

""The Working Group Report on Employment prepared for the 12th Five-Year Plan mentions that the rate of employment in the last two decades is lower than the rate of growth of the economy and that the quality of employment and the level of productivity are areas of concern,"" Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs and Planning Rajeev Shukla said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.

He said the 12th Five-Year Plan recognises that in order to promote employment it is not sufficient to have high rate of growth but that growth should be more inclusive and employment opportunities should be more productive.

""With the above objective in mind, the Plan seeks a substantial step-up in manufacturing sector growth to 12-14 percent over the medium term to generate 100 million additional jobs by 2025,"" Shukla said.

The minister said emphasis is to be given to labour intensive sectors such textile and garments, leather and footwear, gems and jewellery, food processing, as well as micro, small and medium enterprises.

Skill development is another thrust area in the Plan strategy and market demand is sought to be met by optimising respective strengths of the public and private entities engaged in skill development besides focusing on quality, quantity, equity and systemic reforms in skilling.

""The future strategy on employment generation also envisages simplification and rationalisation of labour laws to encourage growth in those sectors that provide productive and better paying jobs for workers,"" he added.

Electronics market to reach Rs 20 lakh crore by 2020: Assocham,"New Delhi: With continuing growth in local manufacturing, the Indian electronics market is expected to reach Rs 5 lakh crore by this year-end and Rs 20 lakh crore by 2020, Assocham on Tuesday said.

In 2010, the electronics market was at Rs 3.25 lakh crore, the industry chamber said.

The industry could rise to such a volume if a strong push is given to domestic manufacturing, thereby bridging the demand-supply gap and generate mass employment in the country.

It called for fostering innovation and developing clusters for local production.

In recent years, high-volume imports of components and finished products have hampered the growth of electronics manufacturing base, said Assocham secretary general D S Rawat.

""There is need to create industrial clusters for fostering innovation and manufacturing domestically,"" Rawat said.

The government needs to take quick steps to start developing an ecosystem which will attract manufacturing investments, he added.

'55 mn jobs needed by 2015 to keep current employment level',"New Delhi: India requires about 55 million additional jobs by 2015 to maintain its current ratio of employed to total population at 39 percent, research firm Crisil said Tuesday.In a report 'Employment in India: Uneven and Weak', Crisil said the country has to nearly double the job creation rate, witnessed during 2005-10, to achieve this number.Net addition of jobs during 2005-10 was 27.7 million as compared to 27.2 million jobs created in 2000-05.""Job creation has clearly not kept pace with the GDP growth. The GDP growth increased to 8.6 percent during 2005-10 from 6 percent during 2000-05, but the net addition to jobs remained almost flat at around 27 million during the two time periods,"" Crisil Chief Economist D K Joshi said.He also said that combined with a decline in the number of self-employed persons, this sharply reduced the employment intensity (number of persons per lakh of real GDP) to 1 in 2005-10 period from 1.7 in the preceding five years.The study -- based on National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data on employment -- also said that generating 55 million jobs would pose an overwhelming challenge without appropriate policy support.It also said that employment potential of fast growing manufacturing and services sector could not be fully exploited due to the lack of enabling policy environment.""In manufacturing, which is a crucial source of jobs for relatively low-skilled labour, (jobs) declined by 7 percent despite a faster growth in manufacturing output,"" Crisil said.It also pointed out that employment growth in financial intermediation and business services slowed down during 2005-10 period.However, job creation was up by around 70 percent in the construction sector, mainly comprising up of casual jobs.The report said that there was a decline in number of self employed people by 25.5 million in 2005-10 period as compared to an increase of 65.5 million in the preceding five years.Similarly, around 65 percent of the total jobs were created in rural areas during this period.Referring to job creation patterns, it said that high economic growth alone would not be able to create jobs as it required appropriate policy measures in this regard.""The role of policy assumes greater importance now since the weak growth in advanced countries is likely to hurt job growth in export-oriented sectors in India,"" Crisil said.The agency said that policy gridlock in labour reforms remained the primary cause of insufficient labour demand in manufacturing. In financial intermediation and business services, labour supply had not kept pace with growing demand due to shortage of highly educated skilled labour.

India to see highest rise in employment in 2016: Survey,"New Delhi: Buoyed by positive economic sentiment, employment scenario in India is set to move up and the country is expected to see the highest rise in hiring process this year among Asia/Australia region, a survey says.

According to the ninth annual Global Business and Spending Monitor survey conducted by American Express in partnership with CFO Research, 83 percent of Indian executives expect their companies to hire more and 52 percent respondents expect employment to grow by over 10 percent.

""Sustained high level of optimism towards growth will see India as a bright spot for hiring as companies get ready to add to the government's initiative towards improving job-oriented skills in the country,"" American Express Global Corporate Payments Country Business Head Saru Kaushal said.

The survey based on sampling of senior finance and corporate executives from large companies around the world said that globally financial executives expect their companies' headcount to increase by 9 percent on an average in 2016, largely owing to decent rise in recruitments by companies in the US, Mexico, and India (13 percent each).

However, talent crunch is expected to affect the recruitment drive of Indian companies going forward.

""7 out of 10 Indian executives polled that their companies' performance goal has been impeded by inability to hire requisite positions in sales and marketing,"" the report said, adding that 60 percent of respondents say their companies have been affected by difficulty in hiring more skilled and specialised workers.

Moreover, half of the respondents find it difficult to fill positions for IT staff, administration and support staff and offshore or outsourced positions.

The survey further noted that around 60 percent of Indian executives expect to raise wages or salaries in order to attract or retain employees, while 53 percent would be looking at improving the working environment and rotate key employees through different functions or departments in order to retain them.

Automation threatens 69% jobs in India: World Bank,"Washington: Automation threatens 69 percent of the jobs in India and 77 percent in China, according to a World Bank research which says technology could ""fundamentally disrupt"" the pattern of traditional economic path in developing countries.

""As we continue to encourage more investment in infrastructure to promote growth, we also have to think about the kinds of infrastructure that countries will need in the economy of the future. We all know that technology has and will continue to fundamentally reshape the world,"" World Bank President Jim Kim said.

""But the traditional economic path from increasing productivity of agriculture to light manufacturing and then to full-scale industrialisation may not be possible for all developing countries,"" Kim said in response to a question at the Brookings Institute during a discussion on extreme poverty yesterday.

""In large parts of Africa, it is likely that technology could fundamentally disrupt this pattern. Research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened in India by automation is 69 percent, in China it is 77 percent and in Ethiopia, the percentage of jobs threatened by automation is 85 percent,"" he said.

""Now, if this is true, and if these countries are going to lose these many jobs, we then have to understand what paths to economic growth will be available for these countries and then adapt our approach to infrastructure accordingly,"" Kim said.

He said one child policy could have been reason of sharp decline in child stunting and malnutrition, which is now at 10 percent.

""The one child policy could have been part of it, but anyway the point is, that if you look at educational outcomes and things like child stunting, India is at 38.7 percent child stunting, they are literally walking into the future with 40 percent of their workforce probably being unable to compete in the global digital economy, whereas China over the years has brought it down very, very low,"" Kim said.

""In India, it is probably partly because of sanitation that children are often in a just constant diarrheal stage, because of open defecation. There is a lot of different pieces of it. But I have been saying to the leaders of these countries that have these high stunting rates, there is like an emergency for you, you have got to tackle it,"" Kim said.

Mechanisation and technology have disrupted traditional industrial production, upended manual jobs and call time on the work that has been done by generations of families. This trend is not isolated to the US. It is affecting people in countries everywhere, Kim said.

""When I was in China at the G20, many world leaders talked about the storm clouds of isolationism and protectionism that were gathering and becoming increasingly worrisome to everybody. These trends come at a time though when we need more cooperation, when we need greater economic integration and stronger partnerships than ever before if we want the world economy to return to higher rates of inclusive, sustainable growth.",https://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/automation-threatens-69-jobs-in-india-world-bank_1936931.html,
Indian companies most optimistic globally on hiring plans,"New Delhi: Indian companies have remained the most optimistic globally on hiring plans for the fourth consecutive quarter, while China is placed at the bottom within Asia Pacific region, a ManpowerGroup survey showed on Tuesday.

Globally, India is followed by Japan as the second-most optimistic on hiring outlook, while the US is placed fifth.

Brazil fares the worst globally as one of the only three countries with a negative outlook, the other two being France and Italy.

Within the Asia Pacific region, China has the least optimistic hiring outlook (5 per cent), ManpowerGroup said, while adding that ""for the fourth consecutive quarter, employers in India report the most optimistic regional and global hiring plans"".

Amid uncertainty, global hiring outlook for the July-September quarter of this year showed continued but slowing hiring intentions. Even employers in India reported the weakest outlook since the first quarter of 2014, and reported a decline of 3 percentage points both quarter-over quarter and year-over-year.

""India's prospects remain comparatively positive even amid global economic slowdown. Despite market volatilities, India's macroeconomic fundamentals have improved due to a combination of various initiatives focused on job creation and skill development with a continuing emphasis on ease of doing business, particularly in relation to infrastructure and other large projects,"" ManpowerGroup India Group Managing Director A G Rao said.

Of the nearly 59,000 employers interviewed globally, 40 of 43 countries and territories anticipate increasing their staffing levels in the July-September quarter.

""Stronger employer hiring intentions in most regions is certainly cause for optimism, though global growth is still below pre-recession levels,"" said Jonas Prising, Chairman & CEO of ManpowerGroup.

""The political uncertainty in Europe and the United States means employers are hesitant to significantly add to their workforce, but they do continue to hire at modest levels, and many are still experiencing difficulty finding in-demand skills.

He exhorted the youth of the states to take advantage of these two projects and set up small factories that will add value and generate wealth for the country.

""Today two major projects are being inaugurated in Dibrugarh. This is important because it will lead to value addition of natural resources and generate many employment opportunities for the youth,"" he said.

The Brahamputra Cracker and Polymer Ltd was conceived as part of the Assam peace accord signed during the tenure of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and its foundation stone was laid in 2007 by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Modi rued about delays in first conceiving the projects, then in announcing and foundation laying and further delays in completion, all of which result in cost escalation.

""I should not have got the opportunity of inaugurating the project if this unit was set up 25 years back by the then Prime Minister, he said.

""But, I sometime feel it is my good fortune to do all these good work (inaugurating projects started previously),"" he said.

"New Year 2016 to bring 'achche din'; job market to see more hiring, better increment","New Delhi: High on hope street, the job market promises pay hikes in the range of 10-30 percent and aggressive hiring by the private sector in 2016, but a push will need to come from e-commerce and 'Make in India'.

Another boost can come from the Seventh Pay Commission, which will trigger a big hike in salaries of the government employees, and a domino's effect can be seen on pay packets of many in the private sector as well.

As 2015 draws to a close, HR experts and headhunters feel green shoots of 'achche din' were visible in the job market as hiring activities grew by nearly 10 percent this year and broadly an upward trend was witnessed as the months passed by, barring a few blips around May-June.

Data compiled by various agencies show that the companies have doled out average pay hikes of 10-12 percent this year while the average increment has been higher at about 25 percent for the top talent.

For the coming year, HR experts forecast pay hikes of 12-15 percent across various sectors, while top talent can look forward to up to 30 percent increase in pay packets.

Some surveys have already pegged Indian companies as the most optimistic globally in terms of their hiring outlook for the new year, while the most of the hiring activities are expected in the e-commerce and Internet-related sectors, as also in the manufacturing space as the companies wait for the 'Make in India' projects to hit the ground.

Experts said the job market remained a mixed bag in 2015 but it was definitely better than the previous year as many companies pumped up hiring activities on expectations that the promises of a better investment climate and the government push to manufacturing industry will soon start bearing fruit.

""Yes, it's really starting of 'Achche Din' in job market. Manufacturing and engineering sector is heading to create more jobs compare to last few years. Coming year outlook is very optimistic and more positive compared than earlier,"" recruitment platform MyHiringClub.com CEO Rajesh Kumar said.

Summing up the year in terms of hiring, executive search firm GlobalHunt MD Sunil Goel said, ""Though there is lot of back-end work happening to bring the 'good days', it is still reflected at sentiment level only. It may start reflecting on ground level in year 2016.""

Leading quarterly hiring surveys also predict a bullish start for the year 2016.

According to Antal Global Snapshot, nearly 88 percent of companies in the country have hiring plans for 2016, while the quarterly Manpower Employment Outlook Survey puts India as the most optimistic among 42 countries in terms of hiring plans for the first three months of 2016.

According to Korn Ferry-Hay Group 2016 Salary Forecast, workers in India are projected to see a real wage hike of 4.7 percent in 2016 -- the highest in three years -- while the overall salary increase is expected to be 10.3 percent.

India ranks 18th on most desirable place to work; US on top,"New Delhi: India has been ranked 18th globally on the list of most desirable destinations to work, even as 70-80 percent of Indians are willing to work in an overseas location, says a new report.

The US has been ranked on the top, followed by the UK, Canada, Germany and Switzerland, making them the five most desirable countries to work on the list compiled by the Boston Consulting Group, total jobs.Com and The Network.

The other countries in the top 10, where foreigners said they would like to work include -- France (6th), Australia (7th), Spain (8th), Italy (9th) and Sweden (10th).

As a desirable work destination, India was ranked 18th among G20 nations.

The Asia Pacific region does not generate as much interest as a possible work destination as the US or Europe, largely because of the perceived difficulty of learning Asian Language, the report said, but noted ""some fast growing Asian countries are starting to reclaim workers they have lost.""

Globally, one in every five participants already has international work experience and almost 64 percent said they would be willing to go to another country for work.

According to the survey, around 70-80 percent of Indians are already living abroad or are willing to move to a foreign country for work.

"'Concerted policy push to add 69 mn non-agri, 11 mn mfg jobs'","Mumbai: Although the new government has undertaken measures that generate employment, a comprehensive 'pro-jobs policy' will help add 69 million non-agriculture and 11 million manufacturing jobs by 2020, credit rating agency Crisil said today.

""The government needs to take more steps towards pro-jobs policy to structurally alter the country's employment profile,"" Crisil said in a report.

""This involves, among other reforms, easing labour market rigidities, building world-class physical infrastructure and alleviating power shortage. This can add 69 million jobs in the non-agriculture sector and 11 million manufacturing jobs by 2020,"" it added.

The time is ripe for that one big, concerted push towards a pro-jobs policy that is imperative to alter India's employment profile, Crisil said.

Manufacturing sub-sectors like textiles, food products and related sectors have the potential to drive employment creation over the next five years, it pointed out.

""We believe four manufacturing sub-sectors -- textiles, food products and related sectors, non-metallic mineral products and transport equipment -- can drive employment creation over the next 5 years,"" it added.

However, the reality is the manufacturing sector won't be able to generate adequate employment and the labour-intensive services sector will have to pitch in, Crisil said.

""We believe the labour-intensive services sectors such as trade, hotels and restaurants, education and health, and personal and community services can add another 36 million jobs by 2020. These services will benefit from changing consumption patterns at households, a focus on urbanisation, and a push to education and better healthcare,"" it said.

With job opportunities in manufacturing and services rising, excessive push to unproductive job creation in the construction sector will not be necessary.

""In recent years, construction employment soared in part because of a large number of projects under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. We expect 13 million additions to construction jobs by 2020, compared with nearly 24 million under the status-quo scenario,"" it said.

Thus, the government's focus on effective implementation of pro-jobs policies coupled with education and skill development of youth will mean 10 million less people will be forced into farm employment by fiscal 2020, it pointed out.",https://zeenews.india.com/business/news/economy/concerted-policy-push-to-add-69-mn-non-agri-11-mn-mfg-jobs_108059.html,

Employment rate worsens in state,"Employment and Technical Education & Training Department building in Bhubaneswar. Telegraph picture

Bhubaneswar, Aug. 29: The scope of employment in the state has come down despite the BJD-run government's claim of achieving an inclusive growth higher than the anticipated national growth rate.

The state government expected the state's economy to grow at 8.78 per cent during the current financial year.

Ironically, despite the growth, job opportunities, both in the government as well as in the organised sectors, have come down during the last six years of Naveen Patnaik's regime.

With the shrinkage of employment opportunities, the state government has organised the Niyukti Mela under the Employment Mission. So far, 10.95 lakh youths have registered themselves in different employment exchanges of the state. Out of them, 10.42 lakh are educated.

Replying to a question, the state employment and technical minister, Sanjay Kumar Das Burma said: ""From 2008 till the current year, 95 recruitment melas have been organised. Around 70, 260 youths got employment in different categories.""

Of the total employment provided to the people in various sectors, nearly 13,927 have been employed in the IT sector only.

Madhulita Pradhan, 34, an unemployed youth said: ""There is no need to register one's name in the employment exchange as the scope of getting employment has come down considerably. It is frustrating to enroll one's name and waiting endlessly for a call from the employment exchange.""

Government officials said the state government has launched the Chief Minister Employment Generation Scheme to give a boost to the recruitment drive. ""Under the scheme, around 11 lakh youths, both in the rural and urban areas would be given employment in five years,"" said an official.

These 11 lakh youths will be provided either direct or indirect employment besides self-employment opportunity during the period, the official said. He also said that at least 150 youths from each gram panchayat would be imparted skill development training to make them self-reliant.

The official further said the state government was planning to tie up with the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) to enhance the employability of the youths. Various models of the NSDA would be adopted and extensive training programmes would be organised for the youths in the near future.

""The employment agencies empanelled with the NSDA will be roped in the state,"" the officials said claiming that all these measures would resolve the unemployment problem.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/odisha/employment-rate-worsens-in-state/cid/1470862?ref=search-page,

Sebi bid to curb volatility in stock markets,"The market regulator sharply cut down the market wide position limit (MWPL) on stocks that are part of the futures & options (F&O) segment and tightened rules for institutions to short-sell equity index derivatives by linking it to their holdings of the underlying stock. Telegraph file picture

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Friday introduced a slew of measures to curb the volatility in stock markets that will be valid for a month from March 23.

The market regulator sharply cut down the market wide position limit (MWPL) on stocks that are part of the futures & options (F&O) segment and tightened rules for institutions to short-sell equity index derivatives by linking it to their holdings of the underlying stock.

MWPL is the maximum number of open positions (all outstanding positions) that are permitted across all F&O contracts of an underlying stock. Currently, it is the lower of 30 times the average number of shares that are traded daily during the preceding month in the cash segment of the stock exchanges or 20 per cent of the non-promoter holding.

In a circular issued on Friday, the market regulator said MWPL may be lowered to 50 per cent of the existing levels.

Sebi said this would done if the average daily variation between the high and low price of the stock during the last five trading days is more than or equal to 15 per cent. It will also be done if average MWPL utilisation percentage during the previous five trading days is more than or equal to 40 per cent.

The current penalty structure adopted by the stock exchanges or the clearing corporations may be enhanced to 10 times of the minimum and five times of the maximum penalties.The market regulator also raised the margins in the cash market for stocks that are under F&O in a bid to curb excessive speculation. Margins have been raised to 20 per cent from March 23, 30 per cent from March 26 and 40 per cent from March 30.

Sebi also upped the margins on non-F&O stocks. The minimum margin rate shall be increased in phases for shares with a price band of 20 per cent and witnessing an intra-day (high-low) price movement of more than 10 per cent for three or more days in the last one month ‚Äî to 30 per cent from March 23 and 40 per cent from March 26.

Restrictions have also been placed on the exposure of foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), mutual funds, proprietary trading members or their clients in equity index derivatives. In a bid to stonewall short-selling, short positions in index futures should not exceed in notional value their holding in underlying stocks.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/sebi-bid-to-curb-volatility-in-stock-markets/cid/1756194?ref=search-page,
India loses export sop case at WTO,"According to trade experts, the ruling would impact India‚Äôs exports and the government will have to immediately work on alternatives to the schemes. (Shutterstock)

India has lost a case filed by the US at the WTO against domestic export incentives. The dispute settlement panel of the WTO on Thursday concluded that these schemes were inconsistent with the international trade norms.

With this ruling, India will have to rework these incentive schemes to comply with the WTO ruling.

However, India will appeal against the ruling, an official said. ‚ÄúIndia will be appealing the decision of the panel regarding four schemes to the Appellate Body of the WTO,‚Äù the official said.

On March 14 last year, the US had dragged India to the WTO‚Äôs dispute settlement mechanism over New Delhi‚Äôs export incentive schemes, including the Merchandise Exports from india Scheme (MEIS); Export Oriented Units (EOUs) and Export Promotion Capital Goods (EPCG) schemes; and duty free imports for exporters scheme.

The US had alleged that these schemes were harming American companies.

The dispute panel in its report has concluded that most of these schemes such as the EOUs, Electronics Hardware Technology Parks Scheme, EPCG and MEIS are inconsistent with certain provisions of WTO‚Äôs Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.

The dispute panel recommended that India should withdraw the prohibited subsidies under duty-free import for exporters programme within 90 days from the adoption of the report.

It should also withdraw the prohibited subsidies under the EOU/EHTP/BTP schemes, and EPCG and MEIS schemes, within 120 days; and the SEZ scheme within 180 days.

The panel has stated that India will not get an eight-year period like other developing countries for phasing out these schemes.

Cognizant to shed jobs,"During the quarter, revenues rose to $4.25 billion, a rise of 4.42 per cent from $4.07 billion a year ago, while net income rose to $497 million from $477 million. (Shutterstock)

Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (Cognizant) has announced huge job cuts as part of its cost reduction efforts. The move will affect close to 13,000 jobs and India, which accounts for the biggest share of its employee base, may feel the maximum impact.

At the end of September 30, Cognizant‚Äôs total head count stood at 2,89,900. The Nasdaq-listed firm said it planned to remove about 10,000-12,000 mid-to-senior level associates worldwide from their current roles in the coming quarters.

This would include a net reduction of about 5,000 to 7,000 roles (about 2 per cent of its total head count) and re-skilling and redeployment of about 5,000 of the total associates impacted.

‚ÄúWe expect the remaining 5,000-7,000 associates to exit the company by mid-2020 either through attrition or role elimination,‚Äù Cognizant CFO Karen McLoughlin said during an earnings call after its third quarter results. Another 6,000 roles will be impacted by Cognizant‚Äôs decision to exit a subset of its content operations business where it services clients such as Facebook.

‚ÄúOur work is largely focused on determining whether certain content violates client‚Äôs standards and can involve objectionable materials. We‚Äôve determined that this subset of work is not in line with our strategic vision for the company,‚Äù Cognizant CEO Brian Humphries said while commenting on the decision to close the content moderation business.

During the quarter, revenues rose to $4.25 billion, a rise of 4.42 per cent from $4.07 billion a year ago, while net income rose to $497 million from $477 million.

‚ÄúWe are announcing a simplification of our operating model and a cost reduction programme, which will allow us to fund investments in growth. Looking ahead, we see a clear path to unlock the organisation‚Äôs full growth potential, win in our key digital battlegrounds, and return Cognizant to its historical position of being the bellwether of the IT services industry,‚Äô‚Äô Humphries said.

The optimisation of cost structure is expected to result in total charges of around $150-200 million, primarily related to severance and facility exit costs. The move is expected to result in an annualised gross savings run rate of approximately $500-550 million in 2021, the company said.

While the IT services industry has been witnessing softness in key sectors such as banking, financial services & insurance, players such as Infosys have added employees. During the September quarter, the Bangalore-based company made a net addition of 7,457 employees. Its total employee count stands at 2,36,486.

TCS, which has a total count of 4,50,738, made a net addition of 14,097 employees during the quarter over the preceding three months.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/cognizant-to-shed-jobs/cid/1715978?ref=search-page,
Yes Bank gets $1 billion funds prop,"The bank added that it continued to be in advanced discussions with other global and domestic investors. (Shutterstock)

Yes Bank informed the stock exchanges on Thursday that it has received a binding offer from a foreign investor to infuse $1.2 billion in the bank. The board of the bank is meeting on Friday to consider its second-quarter results.

The announcement on the bourses led to the bank‚Äôs shares rising almost 35 per cent during intra-day trade on the BSE. Yes Bank closed at Rs 70.45, a gain of 24 per cent.

The bank said it had received the offer to invest $1.2 billion through a fresh issue of equity shares, subject to regulatory approvals as well as approvals from the board and shareholders.

The bank added that it continued to be in advanced discussions with other global and domestic investors.

Though Yes Bank did not disclose the identity of the investor, a news channel said Hong-Kong based SPGP Holdings had expressed interest in investing $1.2 billion.

‚ÄúApart from maintaining a minimum capital requirements, the amount is sizeable enough to take care of future growth as well,‚Äù said Anusha Raheja, BFSI research analyst at LKP Securities.

Based on the closing price of the Yes Bank stock on Wednesday, analysts estimate the investor could pick up to a little over 30 per cent in the lender. However, much will depend on the RBI.

The rules laid out by the central bank cap investment by a single entity in a private sector bank at 10 per cent.

However, the central bank can allow a ‚Äúregulated, well diversified and listed/supranational institution/ public sector undertaking/government‚Äù to hold up to 40 per cent in a bank. The RBI can also ‚Äúunder special circumstances‚Äù give its permission on a case by case basis.

The RBI has set a precedent in this regard when it allowed Prem Watsa-led Fairfax to gain majority control over Catholic Syrian Bank (now CSB Bank).

Last month, Yes Bank had informed the stock exchanges that it had received strong interest from multiple foreign as well as domestic private equity and strategic investors and it remains firmly on course to raise growth capital.

The Yes Bank stock has been under pressure in recent months because of a rise in its stressed assets.

Sensex at a new high

The BSE Sensex galloped to a fresh lifetime high in intra-day trade on Thursday before closing a tad lower as investors kept their faith in IT and banking stocks amid firm global cues.

After scaling a new peak of 40392.22, the 30-share index pared some gains to settle at 40129.05, up 77.18 points, or 0.19 per cent.

Reliance Jio bid to scupper bailout,"Reliance Jio's headquarters in RCP, Navi Mumbai. Airtel and Jio account for more than half of the dues. Most of the other players have already shut operations, withered by the heat of competition in the sector. (Wikipedia)

Reliance Jio has turned up the heat on its rivals, Airtel and Vodafone, by trying to scuttle the possibility of a government-funded bailout package for the two telecom giants.

The Mukesh Ambani-owned company has written to telecom minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in an effort to torpedo any bailout package for the two legacy telecom players who have been left gutted by an adverse Supreme Court verdict on licence fee dues.

Last week the apex court had upheld the validity of the telecom department‚Äôs notices to 15 telecom players demanding payment of overdue licence fees running into Rs 92,600 crore, inclusive of penalties and interest. It ordered the telecom companies to pay their dues in three months and submit proof of compliance with the court.

Airtel and Jio account for more than half of the dues. Most of the other players have already shut operations, withered by the heat of competition in the sector.

‚ÄúAll operators should be mandated to deposit applicable amounts within the three months‚Äô period as mandated by the Supreme Court,‚Äù Jio said in the letter.

Copies of the letter were also sent to the top bureaucrats in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, cabinet secretary, Niti Aayog, finance and law secretaries, and the department of telecom.

The epistolary war between the two sides erupted after the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to the government seeking a bailout package for the two telecom players, arguing that if the government demurred it would create monopolies in the sector, kill competition, jeopardise the government‚Äôs source of revenue and undermine its goals for digitisation in the country.

‚ÄúAny such package which prima facie appears to mitigate perceived financial strains, if granted, is likely to raise similar demands from other sectors such as aviation,‚Äù the latest Jio letter said.

On Wednesday, Reliance Jio had slammed the COAI for its hasty and biased advocacy of reliefs for the two troubled telecom players without taking the views of the Ambani-owned company into consideration.

When contacted, an official from Vodafone Idea said that they have no comments to offer on the latest Jio letter. However, shares of the telco gained 2.10 per cent to settle at Rs 3.89 on the BSE after crashing over 13 per cent during intra-day trades to Rs 3.31 ‚Äî a 52-week low.

Shares of Bharti Airtel also rose 1.67 per cent to end at Rs 374.40.

Vodafone clarification

Replying to a clarification sought by the bourses, Vodafone said it was not aware of Vodafone Plc exiting Indian operations and that news of Vodafone Idea seeking debt recast from lenders was baseless and factually incorrect.

Later in the evening, Vodafone Plc said: ‚ÄúVodafone is aware of the baseless rumours circulating in some of the Indian media that we have decided to exit the market. We would like to categorically state that this is not true and is malicious... We are fully supportive of our local management as they continue to manage our joint venture in these challenging times‚Äù.

while drawing attention to the fact that the two operators had deliberately chosen to stick to below cost tariffs when there was no compelling competitive pressure to do so.

Jio said these telecom players ‚Äì who had first contested the formula for computing the Government‚Äôs share of their telecom revenues in 2003 ‚Äì of violating accounting standards by willfully violating all disclosure norms since 2011 by not provisioning for these liabilities.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/reliance-jio-bid-to-scupper-bailout/cid/1715985?ref=search-page,

Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan, who faced a stinging attack from finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for presiding over the ‚Äúworst phase‚Äù of the Indian banking sector, on Thursday reminded her that two-thirds ‚Äî two years two months ‚Äî of his tenure as the head of the central bank was under the BJP government.

Rajan, who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) from September 5, 2013 to September 2016, said during his term a clean up of the banking sector that was ‚Äúclogging‚Äù with bad loans had begun and the job remains unfinished.

He said the country needs a new generation of reforms to accelerate economic growth. At 5 per cent GDP growth rate, India was witnessing substantial economic slowdown.

‚ÄúI had just over eight months in the previous (Congress) government and I had 26 months under this (BJP) government. So much of my term (as RBI governor) was under this government,‚Äù he told CNBC in an interview.

He was asked about Sitharaman‚Äôs comments in New York earlier this month where she said that the public sector banks had the ‚Äúworst phase‚Äù under the combination of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Rajan.

‚ÄúLet me not get into a political back and forth. The reality is, there is a clean-up which we started, which is underway, which needs to be completed fast. The recapitalisation has been done, but it also has to be done in the non-bank financial sector which is ceasing up and you need to clean-up, get the financial system going again if you want stronger growth,‚Äù he added.

Rajan said the seeds of the problems were sown in the pre-2008 global financial crisis. ‚ÄúA lot of investments were made and those slowed down. Those created the bad loans which we needed to clean up.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) will be more careful next time before slotting matches in New Delhi and other parts of northern India especially during the post-Diwali period.

Pollution and smog, the after-effects of Diwali celebrations in New Delhi, have once again put the Kotla under scanner as it gets ready to host the first of the three India versus Bangladesh T20Is on Sunday.

So in future, when we schedule matches especially in the northern part of India during winter, we‚Äôll have to be a little bit more practical,‚Äù Sourav added.

Doubts over how the pink SG ball would behave in the Day-Night Test at Eden Gardens from November 22 are still there. But Sourav has a simple message for both India and Bangladesh. ‚ÄúWhen it seams, you have to play. And when it spins, you have to do the same. That‚Äôs it,‚Äù Sourav stated.

Delhi HC to hear Facebook's appeal against order to globally block video defaming Ramdev,"The defamatory video contained excerpts of a book on Ramdev that were ordered to be deleted by the high court in September last year iStock

The Delhi High Court on Thursday admitted social media giant Facebook's appeal, challenging a single-judge order directing it to globally remove, block or disable links to a video containing defamatory allegations against Baba Ramdev.

A bench of justices S. Muralidhar and Talwant Singh listed the matter on December 7 for final hearing, saying it hoped that the arguments would conclude on that day.

The court said it would not be passing any interim order, putting on hold the single's judge's October 23 direction, since the appeal was listed for final hearing.

Facebook, represented by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, urged the bench to direct Ramdev not to initiate contempt action against it while the appeal was pending.

However, before the court could pass such a direction, the counsel appearing for the yoga guru said since the matter was listed for final hearing on December 7, no contempt action would be initiated by his client against the social media platform.

Google, its subsidiary YouTube, and Twitter, which were also directed by Justice Pratibha M. Singh to globally remove access to the video, told the bench that their appeals were also on the way and urged the court that they be protected from contempt proceedings as well.

In response to the oral plea, the bench asked Google and others to first file their appeals.

The single judge had directed Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter to forthwith remove, block or disable on a global basis links to a video containing defamatory allegations against Ramdev.

Justice Singh had held that merely ""geo-blocking"" or disabling access to the defamatory content to viewers from India, as agreed to by the social media platforms, would not be sufficient as users residing here could gain access to it by other means.

Observing that ""the race between technology and the law could be termed as a hare and tortoise race ‚Äî as technology gallops, the law tries to keep pace,"" the court had said the provisions of the Information Technology Act had to be interpreted in a manner so as to ensure that judicial orders were effective and ""not toothless"".

The court issued the direction to globally block links to the video after the social media platforms said that while they had no objection to blocking the URLs and disabling the same, insofar as access in India was concerned, they were opposed to removal or blocking or disabling the defamatory content on a global basis.

The defamatory video contained excerpts of a book on Ramdev that were ordered to be deleted by the high court in September last year.

The high court had, on September 29, 2018, restrained the publisher and author of book Godman from Tycoon from publishing it till the offending portions were deleted, the judge noted.

In the October 23 judgment, the single judge had noted that viewing the video or reading its transcript gave an impression that Ramdev ""has been involved in various murders, financial irregularities, misuse of animal parts etc."".

""Thus, the content of the video to the extent it contains paraphrasing of content, which was directed to be removed from the book is held to be defamatory.

Referring to Madi Sharma, who identifies herself as an ‚Äúinternational business broker‚Äù and who is reported to have organised the unofficial trip of parliamentarians from Europe to Kashmir and a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Congress said the issues involved were linked to national security and sovereignty.

The Opposition party asked how a broker can do what she was doing without the personal authorisation by the Prime Minister.

Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala told a media conference: ‚ÄúWill the Prime Minister tell as who is Madi Sharma? What is the BJP‚Äôs connection to the Women‚Äôs Economic and Social Think Tank‚Äô (WESTT) as also to the International Institute for Non-aligned Studies‚Äô?

‚ÄúWhy and in what capacity is Madi Sharma fixing an appointment with the Prime Minister for a delegation on a personal visit and why is the Government of India facilitating it? Where is the money to finance the entire visit coming from? Why has the MEA (ministry of external affairs) been completely sidelined?‚Äù

Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi tweeted: ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs farmers and unemployed youth do not have this facility through which they can meet Prime Minister and their concerns are heard. But yes, international business broker like Madi Sharma can proudly say ‚Äòcome to India, we will bear the expenses, we have access to the Prime Minister‚Äôs office, will arrange a meeting with the PM. How did this business broker gain access to the Prime Minister‚Äôs office?‚Äù

Surjewala said: ‚ÄúThe Prime Minister and the BJP government should tell the nation who Madi Sharma is, who has, as early as on October 7, is writing emails to EU Members of Parliament, saying that she will fix a date and an appointment with Prime Minister of India. It is a first time that a private individual who claims to be an international business broker is fixing appointments of the Prime Minister of this country, that itself is a serious breach of national security. How can she, without proper authority given by Modiji himself, could have done so? She actually succeeded in fixing the appointment.‚Äù

Surjewala said: ‚ÄúOver the last three days, India witnessed an immature, ill-advised and ill-conceived PR exercise of the BJP government organised by an ‚ÄòInternational business broker.‚Äô The government facilitated the trip.

‚ÄúThis is an insult of India‚Äôs Parliament and our democratic spirit. When our own MPs and Opposition leaders visit Kashmir, they are detained and deported from the airport.

‚ÄúAlso, India‚Äôs time-tested policy over last 72 years is that Kashmir is our internal issue and we will accept no interference or third party mediation of any nature from any government or group of people or organisation or any individual. Modi Government has committed the gravest sin of reversing this policy over last three days.‚Äù

Accusing the government of deliberately internationalising the Kashmir issue, Surjewala said: ‚ÄúThe Modi government has made a spectacle of India‚Äôs diplomacy by outsourcing diplomacy to an ‚Äòinternational business broker‚Äô. It is a sacrilege by introducing a third party to assess the ground situation in Kashmir. It is an affront to India‚Äôs sovereign right over Jammu and Kashmir.‚Äù

Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress leader in the Lok Sabha, also wrote to both the Prime Minister and the home minister, requesting them to send an all-party delegation to assess the situation in Kashmir in the wake of the killing of five labourers from Bengal. He also sought financial assistance to the families of the victims.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/congress-grills-modi-on-international-broker/cid/1715720?ref=search-page,
Trio invest in GVK airport,"The move has effectively thwarted an attempt by the Adanis to pick up the 23.05 per cent stake held by two South African companies in MIAL, which manages the Mumbai airport (in picture) and is developing a new one at Navi Mumbai . (Shutterstock)

The GVK group on Sunday said Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Canada‚Äôs Public Sector Pension Investment Board and the National Investment & Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) will jointly invest Rs 7,614 crore in GVK Airport Holdings Ltd (GVKAHL). GVKAHL is the holding company of Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL).

The move has effectively thwarted an attempt by the Adanis to pick up the 23.05 per cent stake held by two South African companies in MIAL, which manages the Mumbai airport and is developing a new one at Navi Mumbai .

According to a press statement by the GVK group, proceeds from the transaction will be used to primarily retire debt obligations of its holding companies and fund the purchase of additional shares in MIAL by GVKAHL from Bidvest and ACSA in accordance with the right of first offer already exercised by GVKAHL.

The GVK group had earlier said it wanted to acquire a 13.5 per cent in MIAL, owned by South African firm Bid Services Division Mauritius, or Bidvest. The other shareholders are ACSA Global (Airports Company of South Africa), which owns 10 per cent and the Airports Authority of India (26 per cent).

GVK Airport Holdings is the majority owner with a 50.5 per cent ownership in the company that runs the country‚Äôs second busiest airport.

‚ÄúWe are delighted to welcome ADIA, PSP Investments and NIIF as shareholders in GVKAHL. We will now accelerate our efforts for developing the Navi Mumbai International Airport, monetising MIAL‚Äôs real estate assets and building an even stronger airports business,‚Äù said GVK group founder and chairman G. Reddy.

According to the terms of the proposed transaction, upon completion, besides GVK Airports Developers, the other three shareholders in GVKAHL will be ADIA, PSP Investments and NIIF.

G. V. K Reddy will continue as executive chairman, while G. V. Sanjay Reddy will be the managing director in both MIAL and Navi Mumbai International Airport. Upon completion of the transaction, GVK Airports Developers will hold 20.9 per cent in GVKAHL and the balance will be equally shared by the investors.

Mumbai-based start-up Magenta Power is setting up charging stations for electric vehicles across the Mumbai-Pune expressway and plans to set up a similar chain across the Pune-Bangalore and Bangalore-Mysore highways by March.

Magenta Power works on providing clean energy solutions and has three business verticals ‚Äì clean energy generation through roof-top solar solutions, developing EV charging solutions and energy informatics. Magenta is yet to secure funding ‚Äî a bootstrap company ‚Äî and has tied up with HPCL.

Magenta Power managing director Maxson Lewis told The Telegraph over phone, ‚ÄúThere is a range anxiety among EV owners today. The maximum range that EVs offer today is 120 km. So we have built a number of charging stations on the Mumbai-Pune Expressway, so that EV drivers do not run out of charge. We identified locations and set up charging stations, one every 60 km. We have four charging stations with chargers DC-001 and AC-001.‚Äù

The proposed charging chains on the Pune-Bangalore and Bangalore-Mysore highways will have the European standard chargers Combined Charging Systems 2 (CCS2), said Lewis.

‚ÄúToday we are getting one vehicle per day at the charging stations on the EV corridor, whereas we had set up the stations under the assumption of one car per week.‚Äù

The company has also set up the first solar based EV charging station in Navi Mumbai. ‚ÄúEVs are not a solution to pollution. It is just transferring the problem from fuel to chimneys. The solution to pollution lies in solar power or renewable energy,‚Äù said Lewis.

Magenta Power has installed the first solar based EV charging station in a housing compex in Navi Mumbai. The company has installed a 16W solar plant on the rooftop that provides renewable power to the housing and also feeds the three EV charging stations installed there. ‚ÄúThis is the first in India. Nowhere else is there a solar powered EV charging station,‚Äù claimed Lewis.

The company has also launched a ChargeGrid Series that turns any location into a charging station. It is a fully integrated, unmanned, convenient, payment enabled open network of smart charging solutions.

The ‚ÄúChargeGrid PRO‚Äù series is best suited for community charging in offices, malls and residential societies.

The ChargeGrid PRO comes online connected with the mobile app and a command centre. Through the app EV owners can locate charging stations on an aerial map, book charging slots, get updates on charging, recommendations on time-of-day use and paying charges online. The pricing of the ChargeGrid series starts from a range of Rs 11,000 to Rs 50,000.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/electric-vehicles-charging-outlets-up/cid/1714675?ref=search-page,
Coal India automation drive,"‚ÄúThe shift towards mechanised transport will be a tipping point in the transportation of coal in first-mile connectivity and result in multi-pronged advantages to all concerned. Improved loading time will bring down wagon idling, thus increasing wagon availability,‚Äù a Coal India official said. (Shutterstock)

Coal India plans to bring 65 per cent of its production under mechanised transportation by 2023-24, with piped conveyor belts replacing existing road transportation at its large mines.

The move, according to the miner, will help to load coal faster, reduce air pollution and, more importantly, prevent pilferage and maintain quality.

Coal India aims to produce around 880 million tonnes (mt) by 2023-24. As of 2018-19, the public miner loaded around 151mt through mechanised rapid loading systems.

The PSU plans to load another 420mt mechanically, taking the total loading to 571mt by 2023-24, which is 65 per cent of production.

The initiative, which industry analysts estimate could involve an investment of around Rs 3,500 crore per annum, involves setting up coal handling plants with silos and rapid loading systems that have the benefit of crushing and sizing of coal along with quicker and pre-weighted quantity of loading.

The system will be implemented in 35 projects, each having production capacity of around 4mt and above.

In Eastern Coalfields, for instance, Rajmahal and Sonepur Bazari are among the major projects that have production capacity of more than 4mt.

CIL subsidiaries South Eastern Coalfields, Mahanadi Coalfields and Western Coalfields also have projects with capacity of more than 4mt.

At present, coal is transported through road by trucks from the pithed to the despatch point which tends to add to the dust and air pollution. Most of the coal loading into wagons is done through pay loaders, which is prone to overloading or under loading of wagons, besides the risk of extraneous material affecting the quality.

‚ÄúThe shift towards mechanised transport will be a tipping point in the transportation of coal in first-mile connectivity and result in multi-pronged advantages to all concerned. Improved loading time will bring down wagon idling, thus increasing wagon availability,‚Äù a Coal India official said.

A key concern in the current coal loading system is quality maintenance and pilferage. With mechanised loading, both can be curbed, officials said.

The project costs are expected to be met through capital expenditure.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/coal-india-automation-drive/cid/1714676?ref=search-page,
Stake sale in arm boosts SBI profit,"The State Bank of India (SBI) on Friday delivered a pleasant surprise when its standalone net profit jumped almost 219 per cent because of gains from a stake sale in a subsidiary, while its asset quality improved.

The country‚Äôs largest lender posted a net profit of Rs 3,012 crore, which was above Street estimates, compared with Rs 945 crore in the same period last year. During the period, SBI booked a Rs 3,500-crore profit from a stake sale in SBI Life.

Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans eased to 7.19 per cent in the second quarter ended September 30, 2019, compared with 7.53 per cent in the preceding three months and 9.95 per cent a year earlier.

In absolute terms, the gross bad loans came in at Rs 1,61,636 crore against Rs 1,68,494 crore on a sequential basis. More importantly, fresh slippages dropped to Rs 8,805 crore against Rs 16,212 crore in the same period.

The Mumbai-based lender‚Äôs performance is a bright spot in the domestic banking industry where weak credit growth because of a sluggish economy has compounded the bad loan problem.

Segment-wise, the proportion of retail, corporate and SME loans declined even as it rose in the agriculture sector.

At a conference call on Friday, SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar said very few corporates were drawing down on sanctioned working capital limits, thus capping the loan growth to under-9 per cent. This, he said, has forced the bank to focus more on retail advances, which now constitute 60 per cent of the book.

He said loan waivers had caused slippages to swell to Rs 16,000 crore earlier and the Rs 8,000-crore is the normal number. ‚ÄúWe have reached a situation where our gross slippages, even in not-so-good circumstances, are not likely to exceed two per cent,‚Äù the SBI chairman added.

Kumar further said the SBI has a Rs 7,000-crore exposure to DHFL (which he did not name though) and expects the account to slip into NPA in the third quarter.

Sales slump severely dents Maruti profit,"Maruti Suzuki India (MSI), the country‚Äôs largest car maker, reported a 39 per cent drop in consolidated net profit for the second quarter ended September 30, hit by a sales slowdown in the industry. The fall in quarterly profit was the steepest in eight years.

The company posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 1,391.1 crore in the second quarter compared with Rs 2,280.2 crore in the year-ago period.

The last time the company saw a bigger decline in net profit was in the second quarter of 2011-12 when it posted a net profit of Rs 241 crore, down 56 per cent from Rs 549 crore in the year-ago period.

Revenue from operations in the second quarter stood at Rs 16,123.2 crore against Rs 21,553.7 crore in the year-ago period, down 25.19 per cent.

Sales during the quarter stood at 3,38,317 units compared with the same period last fiscal, down 30.2 per cent.

MSI chairman R.C. Bhargava said: ‚ÄúThe results of the second quarter and the first half of the fiscal are substantially lower than the last year. The sales have dropped 22 per cent (in Q2) as a result of that everything has dropped.‚Äù

The auto industry has been affected by affordability issue as the cost of owning a car escalated on account of new safety and emission regulations, besides the hike in insurance and registration charges, he said.

‚ÄúThis got compounded by lower availability of finance for inventory and buying cars, along with increased down-payment requirement,‚Äù Bhargava said, adding banks were yet to fully transfer the benefit of the repo rate cut by the RBI to consumers.

"Merger bells ring for BSNL, MTNL","(From left) Union ministers Hardeep Singh Puri, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Prakash Javadekar announcing cabinet decisions in New Delhi on Wednesday PTI

The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved the merger of MTNL and BSNL, in a Rs 69,000-crore revival package for the telecom PSU duo that envisages a VRS covering 50 per cent of the employees, the issue of Rs 15,000-crore of sovereign bonds to partially fund the rescue plan and allocation of 4G spectrum.

‚ÄúBSNL and MTNL are not being closed, divested or hived off to any third party. They are a strategic asset. We want to make them competitive, bring in professionalism,‚Äù Union communications minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said after the cabinet meeting.

Prasad said before the merger, MTNL will be a subsidiary for BSNL and the government expects the companies to become profitable over the next two years. BSNL is unlisted, while MTNL is listed, though its net worth has turned negative.

BSNL had 116 million subscribers in August with a 12 per cent market share in the highly competitive telecom market in the country, according to Trai data.

BSNL and MTNL will raise Rs 15,000 crore through sovereign guaranteed bonds to meet the immediate capital requirement. They will be allocated 4G spectrum worth Rs 20,140 crore and GST relief of Rs 3,674 crore that would have been levied on the spectrum.

Besides, the VRS will cost Rs 29,937 crore. Employee costs of BSNL make up 75 per cent of its income and 97 per cent for MTNL.

Voluntary retirement

Prasad said BSNL and MTNL would offer voluntary retirement to their employees aged 50 years. The cost of the VRS will be borne by the government through budgetary support.

The ex-gratia component of VRS will require Rs 17,169 crore in addition to pension, gratuity and commutation. Details of the scheme will be

finalised by the two companies, he said. BSNL has around 1.65 lakh employees, while MTNL has around 22,000 employees.

‚ÄúThe VRS is voluntary; nobody can be forced to opt for it,‚Äù Prasad said.

The government has set a deadline of January 31, 2020 for the employees to opt for the scheme.

In the package, the government has approved Rs 17,169 crore under the ex-gratia component and Rs 12,768 crore for early pensionary benefit.

‚ÄúEmployees above 53.5 years will get 125 per cent of the salary they could have earned in the balance period of their service,‚Äù telecom secretary Anshu Prakash said.

Employees in the age bracket of 50 years to 53.5 years opting for VRS will get 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the remuneration to be paid in the remaining period of their service.

R.C. Pandey, general secretary of Bharatiya Telecom Employees Union (BSNL), affiliated to the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh of the Sangh Parivar, said: ‚ÄúWe would have been much happier if the third pay revision committee recommendations were also considered.‚Äù

Monetising assets

The plan includes monetising Rs 38,000 crore of BSNL-MTNL assets over the next four years. As of March 2018, BSNL owned land worth Rs 70,000 crore and buildings worth Rs 3,760 crore.

Prakash said the 4G spectrum would be allocated to both the companies administratively within a month.

‚ÄúSpectrum allocation to BSNL worth Rs 14,115 crore will be in lieu of equity and about Rs 6,295 crore for MTNL in lieu of preferential shares,‚Äù Prakash said.

Allocation will be at 2016 prices, which will require a payout of Rs 4,000 crore from the Union budget.

BSNL plans to roll out 60,000 mobile sites for 4G services for Rs 7,200 crore.

The company has already installed 10,000 mobile sites for 4G service in select cities of Kerala, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh and plans to activate all of them within one and half month.

‚ÄùIn the first phase, we have plan to roll out 60,000 mobile sites for 4G services across India in the next 12-15 months. These sites will be rolled out in cities where penetration of 4G handset is high and BSNL has good customer base,‚Äù BSNL Chairman and Managing Director P K Purwar told PTI.

The government will monetise MTNL and BSNL assets worth Rs 37,500 crore over a period of three years. As of March 2018, BSNL owned land worth Rs 70,000 crore and buildings worth Rs 3,760 crore.

‚ÄùThe assets primarily include land assets but also rental and leasing of their buildings. MTNL has around 29 retail outlets in Delhi alone,‚Äù Prakash said. BSNL also has huge tower assets. Its subsidiary BSNL Tower Corp. Ltd. (BTCL), was incorporated in January 2018.

He said BSNL will also need around Rs 10,000 crore to roll out 4G services in phases and MTNL around Rs 1,100 crore.

‚ÄùThe debt on BSNL is the lowest. They can raise capital expenditure required for rolling out network from the banks and bringing in efficiency in their operations,‚Äù Prakash said.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/merger-bells-ring-for-bsnl-mtnl/cid/1713799?ref=search-page,
Fuel retailing rules relaxed,"State-owned Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum currently own most of the 65,554 petrol pumps in the country Shutterstock

The cabinet on Wednesday relaxed the norms for setting up fuel stations in the country, a move that could help private and foreign firms to enter a sector dominated by state-owned companies. The new rules will allow companies to set up electric vehicle charging stations, and sell gas, petrol and diesel at their pumps, information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar told a news conference.

‚ÄúCompanies would be able to sell all sorts of transportation fuels at their petrol pumps,‚Äù Javadekar said.

Global oil companies such as Saudi Aramco, Trafigura‚Äôs downstream arm Puma Energy and France‚Äôs Total are interested in setting up fuel stations in India, where demand is expected to rise in the years to come.

The new norms allow even non-oil companies to enter the business in the country.

Companies with a net worth of Rs 250 crore will be allowed to sell petrol and diesel subject to a condition that they install facilities to market at least one alternative fuel such as CNG, LNG, biofuels or electric vehicle charging within three years of beginning operations, Javadekar said.

At present, to obtain a fuel retailing licence in India, a company needs to invest Rs 2,000 crore in either hydrocarbon exploration and production, refining, pipelines or liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals.

Total, in partnership with Adani Group, had in November 2018 applied for a licence to retail petrol and diesel through 1,500 outlets. BP plc of the UK had a couple of years back secured a licence to set up 3,500 pumps but did not go ahead with it. It has now formed a partnership with RIL to scale up its present network of fuel stations to 5,500. While Puma Energy had applied for a licence, Aramco was in talks to enter the sector.

State-owned Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum currently own most of the 65,554 petrol pumps in the country. Reliance Industries, Nayara Energy ‚Äî formerly Essar Oil ‚Äî and Royal Dutch Shell are the private players in the market but with a limited presence. Reliance has less than 1,400 outlets. Nayara has 5,344 outlets, while Shell has just 160 pumps.

While petrol and diesel are decontrolled fuel, the prices of natural gas are set for a six month period based on an approved formula.

Funds prop for rural schemes,"According to Nielsen India, consumption growth in rural India has fallen to a seven-year low in July-September and is lagging urban growth, a sign of stagnant rural income and prolonged agricultural distress. Shutterstock

Rural development schemes are likely to get more funds than allotted in the budget to boost consumption growth, which has fallen to a seven-year low in the villages.

The Narendra Modi-government plans to frontload additional expenditure in the rural job scheme and highway construction projects to boost demand in the rural economy.

‚ÄúThe ministry would seek the parliamentary nod in the supplementary demand for additional spending, which would boost the rural economy,‚Äù a finance ministry official said. The winter session of Parliament will begin on November 18.

Officials said several departments have sought additional capital expenditure worth Rs 1 lakh crore.

A part of the expenditure would be beyond the budgeted amount, requiring the finance minister to place a supplementary demand before Parliament.

The rest of the extra sum would be reallocated from other projects, while unutilised funds in schemes would be spent on the rural programmes. The officials said the goal was to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP.

‚ÄúIn order to boost consumption, the government has very clearly said that public expenditure for infrastructure will be clearly frontloaded,‚Äù finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said in Washington last week. She also said the government is also committed to contain the fiscal deficit.

The government had allocated Rs 60,000 crore for the rural job scheme, which offers at least 100 days of guaranteed wage employment to every rural household.

The budget has allocated Rs 36,691 crore to the National Highways Authority of India for the current fiscal, and the NHAI plans to raise Rs 75,000 crore from the markets to fund key infrastructure projects such as the countrywide road and highway development programme, Bharatmala.

According to Nielsen India, consumption growth in rural India has fallen to a seven-year low in July-September and is lagging urban growth, a sign of stagnant rural income and prolonged agricultural distress.

The market research organisation in its quarterly report said rural consumption grew 5 per cent in the second quarter, while with urban consumption grew faster at 8 per cent,.

Former chief statistician Pronab Sen said the government should take measures to put more money into the hands of individuals through higher outlays such as the PM Kisan scheme, under which small and marginal farmers will get Rs 6,000 per year as minimum income support, and the road projects.

He said the slowdown in the rural economy was creeping into the urban areas, which is impacting overall growth.

‚ÄúThere is a need to frontload the government expenditure, which would boost demand. There is need to create jobs with infrastructure project, which would create demand,‚Äù he said.

PSU role

The finance ministry has asked the PSUs to undertake capital expenditure in a big way in the last two quarters of the fiscal to boost consumption.

Priority to industry interest in RCEP,"Commerce minister Piyush Goyal on Monday said the government will protect the interest of domestic industry before entering into the proposed mega free-trade pact RCEP, which is in the last phase of negotiations.

‚ÄúEvery interest of domestic industry and the people of India has to be protected before we execute any free-trade agreement,‚Äù he said. The member countries have fixed a target to conclude the talks in November and sign the agreement in June 2020.

Goyal said the government would protect national interest first and will not fritter away FTAs like ‚Äúwe saw in the 2009-10 period of the Congress regime, where agreements were done in a hurry‚Äù.

He was speaking at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum‚Äôs annual summit here.

The RCEP agreement is being negotiated among 10 ASEAN members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) and their six free-trade pact partners Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand.

Trade deal with US

The broad contours of the trade deal between India and the US have been decided and will be announced after closing any remaining gaps, Goyal said.

‚ÄúWe have almost resolved the broad contours of what we are going to announce. I do not see any great difficulty in closing the gap on the first announcement,‚Äù he said at .

He said by now both the sides could have announced something, but certain other engagements, including the US talks with Japan and China, delayed the announcement.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/priority-to-industry-interest-in-rcep-piyush-goyal/cid/1713330?ref=search-page,
Fuel imports from US jump,"Energy trade with the US is likely to jump over 40 per cent to $10 billion in 2019-20 as India seeks to move away from its traditional suppliers in West Asia. The diversification also helped India tide itself over the price rise fears in the aftermath of the attacks on a Saudi Aramco facility.

‚ÄúIn 2018-19, the total import of crude oil, LNG and cooking coal stood at $7.2 billion. In current financial year 2019-20, this may go up to $10 billion,‚Äù oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan said at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum‚Äôs Annual Leadership Summit here.

Geopolitical uncertainties, rising US oil and gas production and India‚Äôs energy appetite have created both the need and the opportunity for the two nations to lift bilateral energy ties to a new level.

In October 2017, India began importing crude oil from the US and in March 2018 it got the first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from there. In the last one year, the import of US crude oil has doubled and New Delhi is now closing on the biggest long-term LNG import deal.

The minister said supplies from the US had helped control a likely price rise in India after shortage concerns gripped the market following the attacks on Saudi Aramco‚Äôs facility.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/fuel-imports-from-us-jump/cid/1713331?ref=search-page,

Jio slams Trai's interconnect usage charge review as anti-poor,"Trai's move to reopen the deadline for ending charges for terminating calls on rival networks beyond January 2020 had forced Jio to levy a 6 paisa per minute charge on its users recently, effectively ending its free call regime iStock

Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Jio has alleged that review of call connect charges by Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) ""sabotages"" the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision for Digital India, and will hit not only the regulator's credibility but also investor's confidence as the move protects vested interests of some old operators.

Continuing its relentless attack on the regulator and old operators over the contentious IUC (interconnect usage charge) issue that has polarised the industry, Jio alleged that Trai's move is arbitrary, bad in law, unwarranted, and anti-poor.

Any change in implementation of original timeline of January 1, 2020, will end the free voice regime and is likely to increase tariffs, which is against consumer interest, Jio claimed.

Typically, a telecom operator pays for completing calls made by its subscribers to a rival network. This is done by paying the rival network an interconnect usage charge, which currently is 6 paise per minute.

Trai's move to reopen the deadline for ending charges for terminating calls on rival networks beyond January 2020 had forced Jio to levy a 6 paisa per minute charge on its users recently, effectively ending its free call regime.

Submitting its official response to the telecom body on the IUC matter, Jio alleged that ""certain incumbent telcos"" want their large body of 2G customers to forever remain digitally disempowered and deprived of the fruits of the digital revolution. Trai's consultation paper ""protects and perpetuates the vested interests"" of such players, it added.

Jio accused certain old operators of exploiting their 2G customers by charging ""extortionist rates"" for voice calls, which are offered free to all Jio's 4G-only customers.

""The consultation paper...undermines and sabotages Prime Minister's Digital India vision and mission,"" Jio said in its comment to Trai's consultation paper.

It is unfortunate that instead of profiting the poor and marginalised sections of Indian society, the consultation paper has chosen to help profiteers in the telecom business, Jio alleged.

The discussion paper wants India to remain technologically stagnant and backward, the company said.

The move contradicts the authority's past decisions where it was represented that the zero termination charge regime would come into effect for all types of calls from January 1, 2020, Jio said.

It added that the ongoing review, which violates the principles of regulatory predictability, has been initiated with pre-determined mind.

""...the present Consultation Paper has not been issued to address traffic asymmetry, but to address the claimed financial stress of one or two operators at the cost of the interests of the subscribers and the telecom sector, and also the credibility of the authority,"" it said.

The latest entrant, known for its disruptive tariffs, argued the present trend indicates that traffic asymmetry (one of the key reasons for Trai's rethink on IUC) is expected to be reversed in a few months and the present receivers will become payers, and so deferring stated timelines is not going to steer any operator away from the purported financial stress. Moving to zero termination charge regime will reduce overall tariffs for customers, Jio said.

Jio said that had Trai ""recalculated termination charges, it would be less than 1 paise per minute at this stage,"" and added that the small residual value by itself fully justifies the need for moving to zero termination charge regime.

Jio cautioned that Trai's move will have a ""chilling effect"" on any new investments and future new entrants who will be deterred by this entry barrier, and even as the advanced world will move towards 5G, India will continue promoting 2G and keep millions of users out of Digital India.

""There exists no rationale for changing the date of implementation of BAK (bill and keep) regime from January 1, 2020,"" Jio added.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/jio-slams-trai-s-interconnect-usage-charge-review-as-anti-poor/cid/1713012?ref=search-page,
Will prepare blueprint for companies looking beyond China: Sitharaman,"Union minister for finance and corporate affairs Nirmala Sitharaman meets Maldives finance minister Ibrahim Ameer, on the sidelines of the IMF-WB Annual Meetings 2019, in Washington DC, USA, Friday, October 18, 2019. PTI

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has said she will prepare a blueprint for international companies that are looking beyond China to make India as their preferred investment destination.

She said industry leaders who are contemplating getting their businesses out of China are ""definitely considering India as the pitch.""

Therefore, she said, it might be important for the government to now see and meet up with a lot of industry leaders and invite them to India.

""I'd certainly be doing that I go back and design in some way whereby I will identify those multinational corporations, all American businesses or any other country ‚Äì European or a British origin ‚Äì who are moving out of China or who probably are even contemplating,"" she said.

""I will make a blueprint with which I will approach them and put forward to them as to why India is a far more preferable destination,"" Sitharaman told a group of reporters on Saturday at the conclusion of her interactions at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Washington.

That could also be in specific areas in which India has common capacity ecosystem building, whether it is electronics, lithium ion battery or any other semiconductors, she added.

However, Sitharaman said the government's decision is not just going to be purely on the basis of what is happening presently between the United States and China.

""That could either aggravate the situation or probably just be an influence at some level. But the fact remains that there are companies which are looking at relocating for various other reasons also,"" she said.

""That is why I gave that little fine line that I'm drawing about companies which would want to locate elsewhere outside of China. Even as I said that, I said that not every company wants to lock, stock and barrel get out of China, there are companies which will remain there to service the Chinese market,‚Äù the finance minister said.

""After all China is a very big domestic market and the their purchasing power, consumption style may be very different from what it is in India, but I'm making that margin already that companies will probably be there to service the Chinese market tension or not tension,"" the Union minister said.

She said India wants to create an ecosystem to invite the companies to tap the country's market.

""I'm allowing that margin already. Over in about that for those companies, even if they continue to be in China but still would want to produce from elsewhere either to export or to capture a new hub, domestic market like India,"" Sitharaman said.

""There was one thing very clear that India is still for them (companies), one of the biggest options to consider,"" she added.

The minister said it is perceived that the opportunities in Vietnam are not that much attractive.

""In fact, today, one of the conversations that I was having with some of the bank and the government representatives was that even Vietnam now probably is getting saturated. They don't have enough manpower to address expansionary programmes of investment,"" she said.

""So, given the fact that we've given concessional taxation approach to corporate incomes, corporate tax having been brought down and the problems that I've just mentioned about Vietnam, there's a higher chance that those companies, which are moving out those investments that want to get out to China, will certainly look at India,"" Sitharaman said.

Sitharaman gave a clarion call for ""concerted action"" in the face of global slowdown.

She also highlighted that the emerging market economies, in particular, face the challenge of achieving economic growth and inclusive development while pursuing sustainable financing.

At the event, she met World Bank president David Malpass, Russia finance minister Anton Siluanov, Kyrgyz Republic finance minister Baktygul Jeenbaeva, Switzerland finance minister Ulei Maurer, Australian treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Maldives finance minister Ibrahim Ameer, and senior minister of Singapore Tharman Shanmugaratnam.

Meanwhile, speaking on India-China trade deal, Sitharaman said the negotiations on the deal are going in ""full speed"" and expressed hope that an agreement will be structured soon.



The ongoing trade deal negotiations briefly came up for discussion during a pull aside between Sitharaman and US treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin at the IMF headquarters.

Mnuchin is scheduled to visit India early next month.

""In fact, I broadly mentioned it to secretary Mnuchin, but that is something on which the commerce minister and Mr (Robert) Lighthizer (US trade representatives) are working. My inputs are that the negotiations are going in full speed and there's a great intensity with which both sides are engaging and hopefully the deal will be structured soon,"" Sitharaman said.

India is demanding exemption from high duties imposed by the US on certain steel and aluminium products, resumption of export benefits to certain domestic products under their Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), greater market access for its products from sectors, including agriculture, automobile, auto components and engineering.

On the other hand, the US wants greater market access for its farm and manufacturing products, dairy items and medical devices, and cut on import duties on some ICT products. The US has also raised concerns over high trade deficit with India.

In 2018-19, India's exports to the US stood at USD 52.4 billion, while imports were USD 35.5 billion. Trade deficit dipped from USD 21.3 billion in 2017-18 to USD 16.9 billion in 2018-19.

Responding to a question, Sitharaman said a totalisation agreement with the US has always been on the cards.

Totalisation agreement seeks to eliminate dual taxation with regards to social security and medicare taxes in the United States.

""One of the reasons why that was never responded to was that India did not have a social welfare net or social insurance cover for Indians in the nation. And therefore, if they had to give it, they wouldn't be given in the sense where would it be used? she said.

""Today, I think most private insurances or for many of the families which are below the certain level of income, Ayushman Bharat is a fantastic big coverage. There is also now a lot more private sector option for insurance coverage. So whether that has been factored in now in the negotiations on this particular thing, I'm not adequately informed,"" Sitharaman said.

She said India in the past even, when she was the commerce minister, had put several arguments before, but that was repeatedly stonewalled over the health cover issue.

""I remember that. I've heard it at least twice in my negotiations on the totalisation,"" Sitharaman said. It could be ""humongous amounts,"" she added.

Most of the Indians working in the US unfortunately have no claim over their social security deductions, because there is a minimum period of at least 10 years, she said.

""It's so designed that you really can't benefit. And no one in any case does live for that duration in this country,"" she said.

An official release issued said Sitharaman had a ""fruitful"" dialogue with Mnuchin.

The two sides agreed to continue the dialogue in the first week of November during Mnuchin's visit to New Delhi, it said.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/will-prepare-blueprint-for-companies-looking-beyond-china-sitharaman/cid/1713009?ref=search-page,
Auditor rule rejig,"In July, Sebi had posted a consultative paper on the subject amid growing instances of statutory auditors resigning from listed companies, while some came under the scanner in connection with alleged financial irregularities at firms. The new rules will come into force with immediate effect. Telegraph file picture

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has tightened rules for the resignation of statutory auditors from listed companies or their material subsidiaries.

In a circular on Friday, the market regulator said prompt disclosures should be made about the reasons for the resignation. It added that if an auditor had any concern about the management of a listed entity or a material subsidiary such as non-availability of information or non-cooperation by the management which may hamper the audit process, the auditor should approach the chairman of the audit committee of the firm.

In such cases, the latter should receive such concern directly and immediately without waiting for the quarterly audit committee meetings.

In July, Sebi had posted a consultative paper on the subject amid growing instances of statutory auditors resigning from listed companies, while some came under the scanner in connection with alleged financial irregularities at firms. The new rules will come into force with immediate effect.

Sebi feels if an auditor resigns before completing the audit of the financial results for the year because of reasons such as pre-occupation, it may hamper investor confidence and deny them access to reliable information for taking investment decisions.",https://www.telegraphindia.com/business/auditor-rule-rejig/cid/1712866?ref=search-page,
"Indian economy struggles to expand with rising unemployment rates, stagnant wages, poor female participation in labour force","Even before biscuits, cars and growth numbers made the economic slowdown an uncomfortable reality for India, unemployment numbers gave the first indications of the impending doom. As early as January, media reports had declared that India‚Äôs unemployment rate had hit a 45-year high at 6.1 percent, which was officially confirmed post-elections by the National Sample Survey Organisation. However, the averages conceal significant disparities in unemployment trends across different regions, gender, and age groups.

As depicted in Figure 1, the unemployment rate was 5.8 percent among males and 3.8 percent among females in rural areas, while the rates were 7.1 percent among males and 10.8 percent among females in urban areas; a historic high among all the categories except the last.

These trends are an outcome of a slowing economy whereby the demand is low due to a variety of domestic and international reasons, and companies lay off workers to cut costs. A domino effect follows, where the increased unemployment leads to a further drop in consumer spending, creating a vicious cycle that will take the economy closer to a recession.

The data shows a heavy bias towards unemployment in urban areas. Since the introduction of the dual-sector model by Arthur Lewis, the British development economist, it has been understood that as economies develop, they undergo a process of rural-urban migration as workers move from low-productive agriculture sector to more productive sectors. The unemployment data shows that while India is witnessing a similar migration, it has not been as effective in providing sufficient employment opportunities to its workforce. The unemployment rate of both male and female in urban areas in unambiguously higher than those in the countryside. However, it is also possible that there is widespread disguised employment in rural areas with more workers engaged in agricultural activities than necessary. The latter would imply that India‚Äôs unemployment figures are more than reported.

Another curious and worrisome trend of the Indian economy evident from the data is that unemployment is the highest among the workers with the highest level of education. In theory, education improves employment prospects, but the opposite is true for India, as seen in Figure 2 with the unemployment rate rising as the level of education increases for both urban males and females. Similar trends are observed in rural areas.

Lastly, the most concerning finding of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) is that Indian youth, i.e. those between 15 to 29 years of age, have an unemployment rate that is much higher than the national average. As shown in Figure 3, urban males have an unemployment rate, almost touching 20 percent while it exceeds 25 percent for urban females.

One of the reasons for such a high percentage of unemployment among the youth could be a low level of employability due to the skill gap. Among the age group of 15-29 years, only 2.5 percent of the population received any formal vocational/technical training. With such a dire situation of the Indian youth, India‚Äôs demographic dividend is a challenging prospect.

The data showing high unemployment rates, stagnant wages and low female participation in the labour force portray a worrying image of Indian economy at the moment, and if not acknowledged, would further the downslide of the economy.

"India's unemployment rate at record high since October 2019, soars to 7.78% in February; coronavirus outbreak hits business sentiment: CMIE","Unemployment rate rose to 7.78 percent in February, the highest since October 2019, and up from 7.16 percent in January, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)on Monday, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

India's February jobless rate rises to 7.78%, highest in 4 months - CMIE https://t.co/fe2XzWMJPA pic.twitter.com/s8zJuCPc79 ‚Äî Reuters India (@ReutersIndia) March 2, 2020

The economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia‚Äôs third-largest economym according to Reuters.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37 percent in February from 5.97 percent in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65 percent from 9.70 percent, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed.

The country's manufacturing sector activity eased in February from a near eight-year high in the previous month and business sentiment took a hit amid impact of coronavirus outbreak on exports and supply chains, a monthly survey said on Monday.

At 54.5 in February, the headline seasonally adjusted IHS Markit India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) held close to January's near eight-year high of 55.3, signalling improvement in operating conditions across the sector. This is the 31st consecutive month that the manufacturing PMI has remained above the 50-point mark, PTI said.

India February Manufacturing PMI at 54.5 Vs 55.3 in January pic.twitter.com/YJgRic2A3g ‚Äî CNBC-TV18 (@CNBCTV18Live) March 2, 2020

In PMI parlance, a print above 50 means expansion, while a score below that denotes contraction.

""Factories in India continued to benefit from strong order flows in February, from both the domestic and international markets. The pick-up in demand meant that companies were able to further lift production and input buying at historically-elevated rates,"" said Pollyanna de Lima, Principal Economist at IHS Markit to PTI.

The strong manufacturing sector expansion seen in India at the start of the year was maintained in February, with rates of growth for factory orders, exports and output holding close to January's recent highs. While firms were willing to step up input buying, hiring activity increased only fractionally.

""However, alarm bells are ringing for Indian goods producers as the COVID-19 outbreak poses threats to exports and supply chains. Businesses became less confident about the year-ahead outlook for output, in turn restricting hiring activity,"" Lima added.

The coronavirus outbreak has brought a large part of the world's second-largest economy China to a standstill and its impact has been felt across industries.

On 30 January, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a global health emergency.

The number of deaths globally in the new coronavirus outbreak passed 3,000 on Monday, as China reported 42 more deaths.

On the price front, there was only a moderate increase in input costs, the survey said.

""...Price data continued to highlight a lack of inflationary pressure in the sector. Only modest increases in input costs and output charges were recorded in February, a trend that has been a key theme of the manufacturing PMI survey for over a year,"" Lima said.

Meanwhile, India's economic growth slowed to a near seven-year low of 4.7 percent in October-December 2019.

Despite being one of the strongest periods due to festival season and higher rural spending driven by Kharif harvest, October-December was the third straight quarter of growth decline and the lowest rate in 27 quarters.

"India's jobs crisis: It's no more about who's responsible, it's about what we do now to arrest precipitous slide","A full-blown unemployment crisis is looming over the Indian economy. And, for the first time, there is evidence to show that this crisis makes no distinction between the political persuasions of one kind or another.

According to a recently released academic paper titled: India‚Äôs Employment Crisis: Rising Education Levels and Falling Non-agricultural Job Growth by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K Parida and published by the Centre of Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University, India lost no less than nine million jobs in six years between 2011-12 and 2017-18, straddling three years each of the rule of Manmohan Singh's UPA and Narendra Modi's NDA. This is unprecedented. Real wages also declined in the same period.

Interestingly, what the paper says is contradictory to the job scenario projected by a study by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister that claimed that total employment grew from 433 million in 2011-12 to 457 million in 2017-18.

Calling this trend (decline in total unemployment between FY2012 and FY2018) ‚Äòunprecedented‚Äô, i.e. the first time total employment is falling at this scale, the paper said: ‚ÄúDue to a decline of employment in agriculture and manufacturing and slow growth of construction jobs, the process of structural transformation, which had gained momentum post-2004-5, has stalled since 2012. Mounting unemployment of educated youth, and poor quality of non-farm jobs have caused an increase in the disheartened labour force,‚Äù the paper said.

This is another grim reminder of the worrying course of the economy and the rise in unemployment. Of course, this isn‚Äôt the first time experts are warning about the state of jobs in the country.

The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) job survey for the year 2017-18 had shown a jump in the unemployment rate to over 6 percent, a 45-year high. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) has been warning about the decline in job availability even for skilled youth, for quite some time now. The lack of availability of employment generation commensurate with the increase in population indicates the economy is on course to a full-blown unemployment crisis faster than what experts warned initially.

The CSE paper has some detailed findings.

Key findings of the survey

One of the most important aspects is that real wages have not increased between 2011-12 and 2017-18 in neither rural nor urban areas. Real wages are wages adjusted for inflation and the purchasing power of the individual. This would, in turn, mean that actual poverty might not have declined as certain surveys have shown. Second, agriculture is fast losing its tag of the biggest employer. The share of employment in agriculture and allied sector also declined from 49 percent to about 44 percent (Table 1).

During this period manufacturing also recorded a 3.5 million decline in jobs, which resulted in a fall in its share of employment from 12.6 to 12.1 percent.

The manufacturing sector (mostly construction) which was creating about 4 million jobs per annum during 2004-05 and 2011-12, created only about 0.6 million per annum during 2011-12 and 2017-18 (Table 1). The slow growth of construction jobs has negative implications for low-skilled employment, real wages and the incidence of poverty.

The only sector which sustained growth in jobs (3 million per annum) is services, although the quality of jobs in this sector is mostly poor (outside of modern services).

The Narendra Modi government, very prickly about criticism on the economy, has been defending the problem of job deficit by picking the methodology that suits its counter-narrative, using the EPFO-based methodology. But there is an issue with that. The EPFO-based employment mapping does not capture data in the informal sector, while other studies like CMIE base their findings on household surveys to arrive at the unemployment figures.

Second, there may have been a spike in new EPFO registrations, but many of them may not be active accounts. What this means is that not all the new registrations may be of people currently employed. Experts have cited some more issues with using EPFO data-based methodology to calculate employment/unemployment figures.

The deterioration in the job situation raises a question mark on the quality of GDP growth the Indian economy witnessed in the past decade. It shows that the fruits of an average 6-7 percent GDP growth have failed to reach the common man‚Äîto generate jobs and handhold the poor out of poverty as the official numbers had us believe.

It is high time the government in consultation with experts formulates a national policy for employment generation. Baby steps and sector-specific policy tweaks will not work anymore. This isn't about a blame game. It is about what we can do to arrest the unemployment slide.

"Unemployment rate at 6.1%, labour force participation 36.9% in 2017-18: Govt cites new survey in Rajya Sabha","New Delhi: Unemployment rate in the country as per a new survey was 6.1 percent in 2017-18, the Centre informed Rajya Sabha on 5 February.

Minister of State (MoS) for Labour Santosh Gangwar said that the government is conducting a new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with new parameters and bigger sample size, and its results cannot be compared with previous surveys in this regard.

""As per the new Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by the government, the labour force participation is 36.9 percent and the rate of unemployment for 2017-18 is 6.1 percent,"" he said.

Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the minister said the report of this survey is very different than the surveys conducted in previous years.

This survey is not comparable to previous surveys, he said, adding it was an attempt to provide authentic data with the new survey conducted through the Ministry of Statistics.

""We are focusing on infrastructure development and ease of doing business and India's position in the world has improved. India has improved its position to 63rd rank now in 2019 against 196 in previous years,"" he said.

""Our government is very conscious of creating employment opportunities and is running such programme which generate employment.

""The way our government is functioning, employment opportunities are being created and the youths are getting jobs also,"" the minister said.

Gangwar said the government has stopped the previous survey as the sample size was low and an attempt is being made to improve the data by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.

The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also.

In the first week of April, the rate was recorded at 7.9 percent, in the second week at 8.1 percent and in the third at 8.4 percent, the economy watchdog said citing the findings of its household survey. Now, how should one read these numbers? In the absence of any official estimates on the nation-wide status of employment/unemployment situation, research organisations such as CMIE becomes the only reliable source to assess the crucial job data.

In February this year, a Business Standard report had said that the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) which conducts household surveys on employment situation wasn‚Äôt given permission to release job data that showed the country's unemployment rate at a 45-year-high of 6.1 percent in 2017-18.

The escalation in April unemployment figures, as CMIE itself points out, weakens the optimism seen in the latter half of March, when data showed an improvement in the scenario. The unemployment rate averaged 6.9 percent in the first half of March but fell to an average of 6.3 percent in the second half. The April figures, which have averaged 8.1 percent in the first three weeks, put cold water on the optimism.

An interesting finding of the CMIE data this time is that elections have given workers some reason to cheer as well. According to this, the labour force participation rate touched a recent peak of 44.3 percent in the week of 14 April. The average labour force participation rate during the first three weeks of April 2019 was 43.5 percent compared to 42.3 percent during the first three weeks of March 2019. This is a sharp jump, it said.

The labour participation rate started to rise in the third week of March, i.e. the week ended 24 March. CMIE attributes the increase in labour participation to the labour-intensive election campaigns, organising rallies and events. In the backdrop of CMIE findings showing a sharp rise in unemployment, it is imperative that the government doesn‚Äôt delay the official figures any longer to offer more clarity on the employment situation.

One needs to look at the unemployment figures in the context of what is going on in the real economy. For nearly a year now, the factory output has been struggling to revive, caused by a drag in the manufacturing sector and investment activity. The factory output (index of industrial production or IIP) numbers for February has shown a 0.1 percent growth in February as against 6.9 percent in the year-ago period. That‚Äôs the slowest growth in at least 20 months, data shows.

In June 2017, the IIP growth was contracted by 0.3 percent. In the April-February period, the IIP grew by 4 percent. During fiscal 2018 (April-February), the factory output had grown 4.3 percent. Of the multiple indicators that constitute the IIP, the manufacturing sector has disappointed the most, contracting by 0.3 percent in February 2019 compared with 8.4 percent in February 2018. That‚Äôs even more worrying because growth in the manufacturing sector is key for job creation.

The drag in the manufacturing sector is a direct result of poor investments and complicated land, labour sector reforms. Sadly, these two areas have been given very little attention by the Centre so far. The capital goods component in the IIP, which indicates investment activity, has been falling. In February, this segment contracted by 8.8 percent compared with a contraction of 3.4 percent in the previous month in the month before.

India will have to accelerate its manufacturing sector growth if it wants to create more employment opportunities; now read this with the unemployment figures. Coming back to unemployment figures, the CMIE had said that at 7.2 percent, the country‚Äôs unemployment rate in February was the worst in at least 29 months when labour force dwindled 25.7 million since September 2016. Going by the data available so far, April could be worse.

"'Nothing done to address unemployment, economic slowdown in 60 years': Amit Shah slams Congress after laying foundation stone at Indian Institute of Skills","Ahmedabad: Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Wednesday hit out at the Congress and other Opposition parties for spreading negativity on jobs and economy fronts, saying those who did nothing in 60 years of their rule are now questioning the Modi government.

Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of Skills (IIS) in Ahmedabad, the minister said the government's target to make India a $5 trillion economy was achievable and the youth's inclination towards entrepreneurship may play a big role in achieving the objective.

Shah said the Congress could only manage to take the country's economy to a $2 trillion mark despite ruling for decades, but the NDA government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership took it to $3 trillion in just five years time.

'Taking a dig at the Congress, he said those who did nothing to steer the country's economy in 60 years were now questioning the present government.

He said the government is taking necessary steps to ensure that youth get the required skills and employment opportunities and are future ready.

On the Opposition being raising the issue of unemployment, he said there are some who view things through a negative prism.

""When they talk about unemployment, a question always comes to my mind, you have ruled this country for 50-60 years, what measures did you take,"" Shah asked referring to different Congress-led governments that were in power at the Centre since Independence.

He further asked was there any new solution found during 50-60 years of Congress' rule to provide employment to the country's youth. ""Is it justifiable that ""you (Congress) ruled for 50 years without doing anything new and now you are seeking answers from us"", he said.

The senior BJP leader said that the government has been taking several initiatives to skill the youth, saying that the young population is a major strength of the country.

""Some may view this as a weakness, but I think 70 crore young population is a major strength,"" the minister said.

He said the Indian Institute of Skills (IIS) will not only help skill India's youth but, will also make them job creators instead of job-seekers.

On this occasion, Industrialist Ratan Tata, whose group is partnering the government in setting up the institute, said many visionary initiatives were being taken up by the present regime.

""I only hope that if I was twenty years younger, I would have more actively participated in this landmark vision. This vision of skilling the youth of the country in market relevant skills is surely taking India forward while making mark on the global landscape,"" Tata said.

Union Minister for Skill Development Mahendra Nath Pandey said before Narendra Modi became prime minister, the country had seen politics of opportunism barring a small period of ruling under the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government.

Pandey also emphasised on skill development and said it ranged from areas from defence to artificial intelligence now.

The 20-acre Indian Institute of Skills is among the three institutes that the government is setting up. The government has chosen Kanpur, Mumbai and Gandhinagar to set up Indian Institutes of Skills.

The foundation stone for IIS, Kanpur was laid by Modi at NSTI, Kanpur in December, 2016. The foundation stone for the institute in Mumbai was laid in 2019.

The proposed institutes are to be modelled on Singapore's ITES. Shah laid the foundation stone of the IIS at Nasmed in Kalol tehsil of Gandhinagar through remote control at a ceremony at the Mahatma Mandir in Gandhinagar.

The IIS Gandhinagar and Mumbai are being set up in partnership with the Tata Education and Development Trust. Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Tata Sons Chairman N Chandrasekaran were also present on this occasion.

Shah suggested linking of the Indian Institute of Skills, Gandhinagar with around 272 industrial training institutes in the state towards upgradation of ITIs, a suggestion which was accepted by Ratan Tata.

"Unemployment continues to be a major concern for Indians, global citizens for third straight month: Report","Unemployment sits right at the top, as the biggest worry for Indians as well as the global citizens, three months in a row ‚Äì from May to June and now in July too ‚Äî as per the latest findings of What Worries the World, a monthly global survey.

But there are some happy tidings for India. The country continues to buck the global trend of pessimism, with at least 73 percent of Indians optimistic that it is heading in the right direction, said a survey by Ipsos, an independent market research company.

The world view, on the contrary, is highly pessimistic, with at least 58 percent of global citizens believing their respective countries are on the wrong track. Further, of the 27 markets covered in the survey, at least 23 markets feel they are on the wrong track.

As per the survey, the markets most buoyant are China (at 94 percent), Saudi Arabia (78 percent), India (73 percent) and Malaysia (60 percent). And the markets most pessimistic about the course their country is traversing were largely, Great Britain (78 percent), France (77 percent), South Africa (74 percent), Belgium (74 percent), Spain (69 percent) and Hungary (68 percent).

Optimism apart, there are a number of issues worrying Indians, in July 2019.

Top issues worrying Indians

Unemployment continues to be the biggest worry of Indians. For the past 3 months in a row, unemployment continues to take pole position in the list of top worries, without any reprieve.

The top five issues worrying Indians are ‚Äì unemployment (46 percent), crime and violence (37 percent), financial & political corruption (34 percent), terrorism (29 percent) and poverty and social inequality (28 percent).

""Indians on one hand are highly optimistic about the direction the country is going in, at the same time, unemployment is the niggling worry, without any let-up. At the same time, some of the concerns have shown marginal improvement over last round ‚Äì financial and political corruption is down by 5 percent, terrorism by 2 percent and poverty and social inequality by 1 percent. All these issues need govt‚Äôs attention and intervention,"" says Parijat Chakraborty, country service line leader, public affairs and corporate reputation, Ipsos India.

Top 5 issues at global level attaining gargantuan proportions?

Unemployment sits right at the top (32 percent), followed by poverty and social inequality (32 percent), crime & violence (31 percent), financial & political corruption (30 percent) and healthcare (26 percent).

Issues that rattle Indians are predominant in some other markets as well.

Unemployment is the most pronounced for South Korea (64 percent) and South Africa (62 percent) and least for Germany (8 percent), Poland (9 percent) and the US (10 percent). India is placed 7th in the pecking order.

Crime and violence are the most nightmarish for Mexico (66 percent), South Africa (62 percent) and Peru (60 percent). India is 9th in the pecking order.

"Economy close to collapse; rising unemployment, falling consumption making India poorer: P Chidambaram","New Delhi: Former finance minister P Chidambaram on Monday tore into the Modi government's handling of the economy, saying it was close to collapse and was been attended by ""very incompetent doctors.""

Initiating the debate on the Union Budget for 2020-21, he said rising unemployment and falling consumption was making India poorer.

The economy, he said, is facing demand constraints and is investment starved. The economy is facing fall in consumption and rising unemployment.

""Fear and uncertainty prevails in the country,"" he added.

He said the chief economic advisor to the BJP government for four years, Arvind Subramanian has stated that the economy is in the ICU. But ""I would say the patient has been kept out of ICU and incompetent doctors are looking at the patient,"" Chidambaram said.

""It is dangerous to have a patient out of ICU and being looked upon by incompetent doctors. What is the point standing around and chanting slogan 'Sab ka saath, sab ka vishwas',"" he said, adding every competent doctor the Modi government could ever identify has left the country.

He said a list of such people included former RBI governor Raghurman Rajan, former CEA Arvind Subramanian, former RBI governor Urjit Patel and former NITI Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya.

""Who are your doctors, I want to know,"" he said, adding the government considers Congress as untouchable and doesn't think of any good about the rest of the opposition and so doesn't consult them.

Chidambaram charged that instead of putting money in the hands of people, the Modi government ""put money in hands of 200 corporates"" by way of corporate tax.

He said Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in her 160-minute budget speech did not talk of the economy and its management.

""You are living in echo chambers. You want to hear your own voice,"" he said.

Listing problems with the Modi government, Chidambaram said it refuses to admits in mistakes, lives in denial and has predispositions.

The demonetisation of old 1000 and 500 rupee notes as well as hurried implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) are ""monumental blunders"" that ruined the economy, he said, adding the Modi regime is predisposed to protectionism, a 'strong' rupee and is against bilateral and multilateral agreements.

""It is living in denial,"" he said, adding the economic growth has fallen for hereto unseen six consecutive quarters.

He wondered on the narrative Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was trying to give after reading out a 160-minute budget speech with few pages left unread.

Her budget neither made any reference to the Economic Survey nor picked up a single idea from it, he said.

Chidambaram, who is credited with presenting a 'dream budget' more than two decades back, said the GDP growth has declined for six consecutive quarters, agriculture is growing by just 2 percent, while consumer price inflation has risen from 1.9 percent in January 2019 to 7.4 percent in a matter of 11 months.

Also, food inflation is at 12.2 percent. Bank credit is growing 8 percent with non-food credit rising by 7-8 percent and credit to industry by just 2.7 percent. Credit to agriculture has declined from 18.3 percent to 5.3 percent and that for MSMEs from 6.7 percent to 1.6 percent.

Overall industrial index showed just 0.6 percent growth. ""Every major industry is either near zero or in negative zone,"" he said, adding thermal power plants are operating at just 55 percent of the capacity as factories have either closed or are on the verge of closure.

""That gives you a good picture of the state of economy. You don't require MRI,"" he said. ""You are in management for six years. How long can you blame previous managers.""

He charged the government with burying unfavourable reports such as the labour survey that put unemployment at 45-year high of 6.1 percent at end of 2017-18. Also, consumer expenditure has falling to 3.7 percent between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Drilling holes in Budget numbers, he said the 2019-20 budget projected a nominal GDP growth of 12 percent but ended with just 8.5 percent. Fiscal deficit was targeted to be shrunk to 3.3 percent of the GDP but ended by at 3.8 percent and in the next fiscal it is being targeted at 3.5 percent.

Revenue deficit was targeted at 2.3 percent in fiscal ending March 31, 2020 but ended up at 2.4 percent and in the next it will rise to 2.8 percent, he said, adding capital expenditure in the next fiscal will shrink to 0.7 percent from 1.4 percent in the current.

Net tax revenue in the current fiscal was targeted at Rs 16.49 lakh crore but only Rs 9 lakh crore was collected in first nine months till December 2019 and ""you want us to believe this will rise to Rs 15 lakh crore by March 2020,"" he said.

Similarly, expenditure in 2019-20 was pegged at Rs 27.86 lakh crore but only Rs 11.78 lakh crore spent during April-December and by March this is projected to rise to Rs 27 lakh crore.

""You have no money to spend... and these are masked by numbers,"" he said. ""Numbers are not easily acceptable or believable.""

Chidambaram said the government is facing shortfall in all forms of taxes - Rs 1.56 lakh crore on corporate tax, Rs 10,000 crore on personal income tax, Rs 30,000 crore on customs, Rs 52,000 crore on excise and Rs 51,000 crore on GST.

This despite ""the extraordinary powers"" and ""all kinds of power"" given to lower level tax officials, he said.

He read of list of heads under which allocation has fallen - food subsidy, agriculture, PM-Kisan, rural roads, mid-day meal scheme, ICDS, skill development, Ayushman Bharat, rural development and MGNEGA.

"Unemployment rate among urban youth highest in December quarter; Bihar, Kerala among states with maximum number of jobless youngsters","The unemployment rate among urban youth is the highest among all other groups in the country during the third quarter of 2018. The rising lack of employment opportunities is a cause for concern, according to media reports based on a government survey.

One of the reasons for the rising unemployment rate is that the job seekers between the age group of 20 and 29 opt for higher studies or decide to wait for their desired job in keeping with their educational qualifications.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data for 2017-18 and the December quarter released on Friday by the statistics ministry showed that the unemployment rate among the urban youth between the age group of 15 and 29 was at 23.7 percent in the third quarter of 2018, according to Mint.

Joblessness among the youth during the December quarter of 2018 was the highest in Bihar (40.9 percent), followed by Kerala (37 percent) and Odisha (35.7 percent), while it was the lowest in Gujarat (9.6 percent), said the report.

The unemployment rate in the country in FY18 was at 5.3 percent in rural areas and 7.8 percent in urban divisions, resulting in the overall unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, said The Economic Times report citing PLFS of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).

However, the government contended that the data was not comparable with that of the previous years, in effect seeking to refute the previously leaked reports that said they showed the unemployment rate was at a 45-year high, said the report.

The PLFS 2017-18 revealed that the higher unemployment rate shifted to the 20-24 and 25-29 age groups as against the 15-19 age group previously indicating that the former groups prefer to pursue higher studies or wait for the job of their choice, said a report in The Indian Express quoting experts.

The percentage share of unemployed rural males rose to 43.2 percent in the 20-24 age group during 2017-18, from 38 percent in 2004-05 as per the NSSO round of Employment-Unemployment Survey. But in the 15-19 age group, there was a sharp reduction in the percentage share of unemployed males to 23.9 percent in 2017-18, from 35.7 percent in 2004-05, the report said.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8 percent in the January-March period of 2019, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China‚Äôs pace for the first time in nearly two years, said a Reuters report.

The 6.1 percent figure matches data earlier leaked to the Business Standard in January this year, that said it was the highest level in at least 45 years.

The paper‚Äôs report was based on an assessment carried out by the NSSO between July 2017 and June 2018.

There has not been any detailed official data on unemployment for several years, and on Friday the government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new design, new metric,‚Äù chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters. He did not elaborate further.

‚ÄúIt would be unfair to compare it with the past,"" he said.

"NSSO data confirms India's jobs crisis: Unemployment at 45-year high of 6.1%, way out is to make economy grow","Presentation of data on the Indian economy which is outside the purview of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has become quite opaque of late especially with the back series of the gross domestic report (GDP) with 2011-12 base. Employment is even more controversial as the data is amorphous as information outside the Annual Reports of companies is at best a proxy for the real world.

The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)-Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) debate has become contentious as it has taken a political angle. Jobs are created when the economy grows and if there is a slowdown, it is but natural that the rate of growth in job creation will slow down. However, it becomes a political ego-scoring point to always contend that jobs growth is steady. Therefore, the EPFO data is being touted as being the right way forward.

However, the increase in registrations comes along with the laws which have been changed wherein the Goods and Services Tax (GST)-compliant enterprises which have entered into the organised stream have to follow rules and enroll their employees. Therefore, people shifting from private EPFOs to the state EPFOs or getting in for the first time are not new employees but existing workers who now have cover.

The National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data, which is probably the more authentic source based on sample surveys, has become controversial (and not made public) because the results were not acceptable which has caused some resignations from the National Statistical Commission. This being the case, the results which have been procured by Business Standard and quoted are significant. It does reveal that the unemployment rate was at an all-time high of 6.1 percent in 2017-18.

The Business Standard report has focused on the unemployment rates among men and women youth in both urban and rural areas, which does require an explanation as it is quite deep-rooted and scary. The report says that male youth had unemployment rate of 17.4 percent and 18.7 percent in rural and urban areas, while women youth had rates of 13.6 percent and 27.2 percent respectively in 2017-18. These numbers cause considerable discomfort. This is more so as we talk a lot of the demographic dividend in the country which is taken as an asset for the future.

The contrary view was that if jobs are not created, then there is high probability of this becoming a demographic liability where the unemployed become a social issue. These numbers suggest the same.

The rise in unemployment rate can be traced to various factors. First, farming has become very unattractive given the vicissitudes of the monsoon and government policy. A bad monsoon means lower crop output and income leading to farmer indebtedness and at the extreme, suicides. A good crop leads to prices coming down and with an ineffective minimum support price (MSP), farmers‚Äô income tend to come down again leading to the same set of problems. Therefore, the children of farmers would rather not do farming and move over to the urban areas or look for jobs in the non-agricultural space. In a way, the disguised unemployment which was earlier there with excess hands working on a piece of land has officially become unemployed.

Second, with GST coming in, there has been an upheaval in the small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) space which was a major absorber of labour all through the years especially in rural areas. With forced recognition and opaqueness of processes, there has been unsettling of several self-employed leading to distress. Considering that this came on the back of demonetisation, it was but natural that this class got affected the most as business went down.

Third, migration to urban areas has resulted in more jobs in the real estate construction sector which takes in unskilled labour. This has been the trend in the past. Now, 2017-18 was a year when Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 (RERA) was enforced post-demonetisation and there was a perceptible slowdown in the real estate sector, especially commercial and non-affordable housing projects. The stock of inventory tended to increase which slowed down the pace of new projects. This, combined with slow pace of growth in private infrastructure, meant that these jobs also became scarce. Therefore, the intake of labour was restricted.

Fourth, the youth of today also has aspiration and often are unwilling to take on low-skill jobs once they have a recognised degree. However, given that the economy is not growing at the desired pace of 8 percent-plus in the last three years; demand for labour has been restricted to the higher-end‚Äîengineers, management graduates and other professionally qualified personnel. This makes a basic degree irrelevant for employment and while local laws ensure there is employment in super markets and e-commerce businesses, migratory labour is not within the perimeter.

It is, hence, not surprising that data has been put out at various points of time of qualified students applying for unskilled labour in the Railways or for state jobs. There are just not enough openings available when the economy has slowed down. Also, the rather stringent labour laws have ensured that companies have moved towards technology which will always be a challenge in a labour surplus economy. Rather than get into issues of not being able to lower staff strength when the business slows down, technology substitution helps such companies tide over difficult times.

Further, the quality of education needs to be addressed. While we do take a lot of credit in attaining numbers of school enrolment or even higher education, the quality of education in the public space is inadequate which puts students at a disadvantage. Further, those students from a vernacular background will find openings only in the self-employed or government spaces. The latter is also economising on head count which makes future absorption a challenge.

Therefore, the problem of unemployment is very serious and the only way to go ahead is to make the economy grow which happens gradually over time. It will be a constant struggle until such time the youth is able to get absorbed in the system. This is the real situation and needs to be accepted.

Modi was doing the biggest disservice to the nation by dividing it and distracting the attention of the people, he told reporters after a meeting of the Opposition that was attended by leaders of 20 parties.

""Narendra Modi should stand up and have the courage to speak to the university students on why the economy has become a disaster and why unemployment in India is at its highest in 50 years.

"India's unemployment rate at multi-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18, confirms govt data","New Delhi: India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in the 2017/18 fiscal year, the statistics ministry said on Friday, matching data earlier leaked to a newspaper that said it was the highest level in at least 45 years.

The data was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn-in for his second term. Indian voters gave him a big mandate in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8% in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China‚Äôs pace for the first time in nearly two years.

The government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new design, new metric,‚Äù chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters. He did not elaborate.

‚ÄúIt would be unfair to compare it with the past.‚Äù

The Business Standard newspaper, which first reported the figure in January, had said that it was based on an assessment carried out by the National Sample Survey Office between July 2017 and June 2018.

The unemployment rate was the highest since 1972/73, the newspaper reported without giving a figure for that fiscal year.

The statistics ministry also said that the female labour participation rate in urban areas for the quarter ending December 2018 was 19.5%, compared with 73.6% for males.

"50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation in 2016, reveals latest report on job crisis; unemployment rate rose to over 6% in 2018","Months after a leaked report on unemployment by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) created furore, with the Opposition calling it a ""national disaster"" and the Centre taking recuse by dubbing it a ""draft report"", a fresh study conducted by the Centre for Sustainable Employment (CSE) at Azim Premji University has reiterated that job loss has been steadily rising in the past decade, hitting its worst levels after 2016.

The CSE report ‚Äî State of Working India 2019 ‚Äî revealed that 50 lakh men lost their jobs between 2016 and 2018, and the beginning of the decline of jobs coincided with demonetisation in November 2016. However, the report adds that ""no direct causal relationship can be established based only on these trends"".

The report on the nation's labour market is based on data from the Consumer Pyramids Survey of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE-CPDX). CMIE is an independent economic think tank headquartered in Mumbai. The university's study draws from this CMIE survey of about 1,60,000 households conducted every four months.

The NSSO's periodic labour force survey (PLFS) had shown that unemployment was last this high in 1972-73, and that the joblessness rate was 2.2 percent in 2011-12.

NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar had debunked the claims of jobless growth in this report, saying it was incorrect to compare the PLFS data with earlier NSSO reports as their methodologies different.

Now, the CSE report tells us that both the PLFS and the CMIE-CPDX studies show that the overall unemployment rate was around 6 percent in 2018, ""double of what it was in the decade from 2000 to 2011"".

Perhaps the bigger cause of concern is the higher rate of joblessness among the youth, especially in the age group of 20 to 24 years. Among young urban women, the report reveals, graduates only account for 10 percent of the working age population. Likewise, for urban men, this age group accounts for 13.5 percent of the working age population.

""After remaining at around 2 to 3 percent for the first decade, the unemployment rate steadily increased to around 5 percent in 2015 and then just over 6 percent in 2018,"" the report said.

The release of the CSE report during the Lok Sabha election is likely to give the Opposition further ammunition to target the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre over issues concerning the job crisis in India.

The CSE report began by highlighting: ""The controversy over employment statistics should be seen in the context of the fact there is now a fully established politics of unemployment in India. This is a new development that needs to be understood.""

Speaking at a News18 event in 2018, Nobel-winning American economist Paul Krugman had warned that India could end up with mass unemployment if it does not grow its manufacturing sector.

Moreover, in an email interview to Firstpost, Craig Jeffrey, director of the Australia India Institute in Melbourne, had described the young unemployed as ""stuck somehow between the modern and traditional, urban and rural, childhood and adulthood"".

The CSE report also points to the fact that the current government has failed to release the results of the last Labour Bureau survey (2016-17) as well as that of the PLFS, both of which have been ""cleared by the concerned authorities for public release"".

""In addition to rising open unemployment among the higher educated, the less educated (and likely, informal) workers have also seen job losses and reduced work opportunities since 2016,"" the report said.

"Employment registers a first-time decline by 9 mn in 6 years; joblessness among educated youth up 8.8 percent, reveals study","For the first time in the country's history, total employment declined by 9 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18 revealing an unprecedent trend. According to a recently released academic paper titled: India‚Äôs Employment Crisis: Rising Education Levels and Falling Non-agricultural Job Growth by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K Parida and published by the Centre of Sustainable Employment at the Azim Premji University, employment fell from 474 million in 2011-12 to 465 million in 2017-18.

The Indian economy is passing through an unprecedented phase in its employment history, in which total employment (Workforce) is declining, and open unemployed and disheartened Not-in-Labour Force-Education-Training‚Äù (NLET) youth (a reserve army) are rising massively, the study said.

Mehrotra is Professor of Economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University while Parida teaches at the Central University of Punjab.

The paper is based on both the recent 'Employment and Unemployment' and 'Unincorporated Non‚ÄêAgricultural Enterprise' survey data of the National Sample Survey (NSS). The unit data collected during 2004-05 and 2011-12 employment and unemployment rounds and the annual Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), 2017-18 have also been used for obtaining various labour market indicators: the Labour force, workforce, unemployment and Not in Labour force Education and Training (NLET), the study added.

Here are its key findings:

Rise in share of informal jobs: The share of regular and formal employment increased marginally due to the growth of formal jobs in the private sectors. At the same time, the share of informal jobs within government/public sector increased, the study said. A dominant share of jobs is still generated by micro and small units in the unorganised sectors without any formal or written job contract.

Service sector is driving job growth: The service sector is driving growth of jobs in the non-farm sectors, while employment growth in construction has decelerated along with a fall in manufacturing employment between 2011-12 and 2017-18. While the job market is showing sluggish demand conditions, on the supply side the increasing influx of youth, who recently have completed education and training, has resulted in a massive rise in the number of open unemployed and disheartened labour force.

Fall in employment in agriculture, manufacturing across states: The agriculture sector continued to register decline in employment at the rate of 4.5 million per annum (about 27 million in total) between 2011-12 and 2017-18. The share of employment in agriculture and allied sector also declined from 49 percent to about 44 percent. Manufacturing also recorded a 3.5 million decline in jobs, which resulted in a fall in its share of employment from 12.6 to 12.1 percent.

Falling manufacturing jobs is the opposite of the goal of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, and the opposite of what is desirable if the process of structural transformation is to be sustained.

The non-manufacturing sector (mostly construction ) which was creating about 4 million jobs per annum between 2004-05 and 2011-12, created only about 0.6 million per annum between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Mounting youth unemployment causes an upsurge in the disheartened labour: The labour force (those looking for work) increased only by about 10 million to reach 495 million between 2017-18, because both Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR, or share of those in working age looking for work) and Work Participation Rate (WPR, or share of those looking for work actually finding work) declined from 39.5 percent to about 37 percent, and 38.6 percent to about 34.7 percent respectively between 2011-12 and 2017-18. For youth, LFPR fell from 44.6 percent to 38.3 percent, and WPR fell from 42 percent to 31.4 percent between the same period.

Massive increase in unemployment among educated youth: Overall unemployment rate (based on CWS) increased to an all-time high of 8.8 percent in 2017 -18 from 3 percent in 2011-12 (Table 1) . For each level of education (see Figure 3), the unemployment rate increased between 2011-12 and 2017-18‚Äîamong illiterates from 1.7 percent to 7.1 percent, youth having primary education from 3 percent to 8.3 percent, middle education from 4.5 percent to 13.7 percent, secondary education from 5.9 percent to 14.4 percent, higher secondary education 10.8 percent to 23.8 percent, graduates 19.2 percent to 35.8 percent and from 21.3 percent to 36.2 for postgraduates. Moreover, for the graduates with technical education degree the unemployment rate was the highest (37.3 percent). In the case of formally vocationally trained this rate was 33 percent. The incidence of unemployment almost doubled from 6.1 percent between 2011-12 to 17.8 percent in 2017-18 across all education categories.

Rising disheartened labour force, a potential threat for the economy: The slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have

resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth. Youth ‚ÄúNot in Labour Force, Education and Training (NLET)‚Äù increased in India by about 2 million per annum between 2004-05 and 2011-12,

which further increased by about 3 million pa 2011-12 and 2017-18. About 100.2 million youth declared themselves as NLET between 2017-18. The states in which incidence of unemployment is higher, they also have reported a large number of the disheartened labour force in the form of NLET youth. Uttar Pradesh ranked top among the states having about 21 million NLET youth in2017-18. It is followed by Bihar, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Jharkhand and Assam.

Micro and small enterprises still hold the key role in creating jobs: The overall growth in non-farm sector employment is driven by enterprises which hire less than

10 workers in India. These enterprises contributed about 68 percent of the total non-farm employment between 2017-18. In manufacturing, their share is 61 percent, while in nonmanufacturing and services their share is about 66and 71 percent respectively between 2017-18. This result shows why the share of informal and unorganised sector employment is still so high in India, despite a rise in the number of registered enterprises. Because even though these enterprises might have registered themselves under GST to continue their business (and pay sale tax), they could not provide employment with social security benefits to their employees because of the size of their business.

Unemployment crisis in India: Engineers struggle for work as growth in manufacturing sector slows down,"Chinchwad: Santosh Gurav gained a bachelor‚Äôs degree in technology from a mid-tier college in western India last year, specialising in electrical engineering and hoping to land a job in industrial automation.

Six months on, the 27-year-old repairs mixer-grinders, table fans and other household appliances at a cramped shop in Pune. On better days, he picks up broken LED lights from scrap dealers, fixes them, then sells them. He earns about $50 a month, just enough to cover the rent for the room he shares with two others as his home.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even started repaying my education loan,‚Äù said Gurav, referring to the nearly $4,000 he‚Äôd borrowed for his undergraduate study.

He is one of hundreds of thousands of engineers - studying everything from computer code to civil engineering - that India‚Äôs education system churns out each year, many with large loans and little prospect of finding a job in their field.

They highlight Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs difficulty in fulfilling a promise he made weeks after coming to power in 2014: creating millions of jobs by boosting manufacturing under a flagship ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô project launched with much fanfare.

‚ÄúCome, Make in India, we will say to the world, from electrical to electronics,‚Äù Modi said in his maiden Independence Day speech as prime minister, pledging to create up to 100 million new jobs by 2022.

No echoes of China boom

Four years on, the programme‚Äôs impact on job creation is unclear and growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish, partly due to a lack of land and labour reform.

India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent last month, up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) think tank. The figures are more recent than government data and many economists regard them as more credible.

The data, which is an estimate based on household surveys, shows 31.2 million people were actively looking for jobs in February this year, said Mahesh Vyas, the CMIE managing director. It did not have a breakup for engineering or technology graduates.

With more than half of India‚Äôs population under 25 years of age, critics say the votes of jobless youth could hurt Modi‚Äôs chances of securing a second term in the upcoming general election to be held in April-May.

The increasing use of automation in industry, the massive number of young Indians coming onto the job market, and the regulatory hurdles that companies still face if they want to set up shop in India, are all big issues for those without work.

The manufacturing boom that helped China in the past 40 years will not wash up on India‚Äôs shores. Companies can no longer afford to just rely on cheap labour: they need skilled labour and better infrastructure to drive technological innovations and increase productivity.

Employers often complain about the lack of skilled engineering and technology graduates, said Varun Aggarwal, an electrical engineer and co-founder of the skills assessment firm Aspiring Minds. Its surveys show over 80 percent of the engineers India produces are not employable. The employability has not improved in seven years, Aggarwal said.

‚ÄúThe numbers have just not budged,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMany can‚Äôt even write basic code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to start there, at the beginning of the education system,‚Äù said Aggarwal.

The IT industry had long been seen as a gateway to the middle class in India, but a move to robotics and artificial intelligence has replaced some positions. The business process outsourcing industry ‚Äì seen as a stable provider of ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù jobs ‚Äì added the least number of employees in seven years in 2017-18 (April-March), according to the trade body Nasscom.

Lack of English skills

At a recent job fair organised by a college in the town of Chinchwad in western India, Gurav was among hundreds queued up to apply, including dozens of engineers, even though most companies were hiring for marketing and finance positions.

Many came from rural areas where they studied in regional languages, and lacked strong English skills ‚Äì another gap that recruiters say India‚Äôs education system needs to address.

Ankush Karwade, 22, who travelled 80 miles (130 km) to reach the fair, said his father was a farmer and the family couldn‚Äôt fund him to earn an undergraduate degree. He did a shorter and cheaper diploma course in engineering.

‚ÄúI watch some English movies and read the newspapers to improve, but most employers want graduates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey (also) want English speaking skills, which I don‚Äôt have.‚Äù

Gayatri, a 24-year-old woman who goes by one name, gained a master‚Äôs degree in engineering four months ago, under pressure from her parents. She said she had wanted to continue her education in Indian classical music.

‚ÄúMy father wanted me to do engineering, so I did it. Now there are no jobs,‚Äù she said. A company at the fair offered her a customer service position that would pay about $140 a month.

‚ÄúCan you believe it?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get this degree to sit at a call centre.‚Äù

Jobless engineers are not a new problem and ‚Äúminiscule‚Äù in comparison to the millions of farmers dissatisfied over weak crop prices, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who also uses one name.

Still, they represent a lot of untapped potential.

Fixing household appliances is not what Gurav expected to do as a graduate. ‚ÄúI could find work at a call centre, but it‚Äôs not what I want to do,‚Äù he said. He may soon be forced to reconsider though as his father is due to retire next year and the family will need the money.

For now, Gurav plans to continue to do the repair work ‚Äì but is too ashamed to tell his friends about it, he said, and refused to be photographed at the shop.

‚ÄúIf people see me working there they might think I‚Äôm unskilled. But I have skills. I am passionate about this field.‚Äù

"The Jobs Crisis in India: An account of a real problem that some fail to understand, and some pretend not to","The actual state of India‚Äôs employment problem is a puzzle even for the best economists in the world. Reason: There isn‚Äôt enough quality data to arrive at an informed opinion. Hence, most of the assessments are based on vague assumptions, extrapolations of small samples.

Whatever numbers are offered by the government‚Äôs surveyors and statisticians on job data, it comes with a painful lag and is often not usable. But the state of jobs is too important a metric to ignore by any serious observer of Indian economy.

In this backdrop, R Jagannathan‚Äôs book, The Jobs Crisis in India, is a must-read for any serious student of economics. It offers a 360 degree view of India‚Äôs job crisis. The language used is simple and devoid of jargon, which makes an otherwise dry subject an interesting read even for a beginner.

As the title suggests, Jagannathan admits the existence of a jobs crisis in the country, which needs to be seen in the backdrop of constant denials and playing down of this critical issue by many in the NDA-government and by right-leaning economists.

The chapters are designed to debate some of the long-known issues concerning India‚Äôs job market, most importantly the absence of quality data available for a fair assessment of the situation, the problem with the very definition of ‚Äòjobs‚Äô in the Indian context (Does selling food on the roadside fall within the definition of a job?), the very pertinent question of whether it is a ‚Äòwage issue‚Äô or ‚Äòjob issue‚Äô given that most people have some form of livelihood but not enough income and the age-old debate of whether automation and technology is a villain or friend in the India-specific employment/unemployment debate.

Jagannathan puts the unemployment rate in the country somewhere between 2.2 percent and 5.6 percent which, however, is too wide and not really a useful range.

To express his overall assessment of India‚Äôs job situation, Jagannathan tells the reader an interesting cricket analogy. ‚ÄúWe have to score 300-odd runs on the final day in deteriorating pitch conditions and after losing a few quick wickets the day before, but we still have enough top-quality batsmen to see us through‚Äù.

This analogy, however, is quickly followed by a warning, ‚ÄúWe have time on our side but not an eternity.‚Äù

There are many familiar reasons the author lists throughout the book to explain why enough high-paying jobs aren‚Äôt being generated in India to accommodate millions of youngsters entering the job market every month. These include lack of demand-driven skill training, very little use of technology in small and medium enterprises and flawed labour reforms.

Jagannathan hits the bull's eye when he says the job problem runs deep mainly because ‚Äúlarger sectors are simply overmanned and underproductive‚Äù making the scope for jobs being shed faster than adding of new jobs in sunrise industries like digital banking and e-commerce.

One recurring issue that comes up in the book is the absence of sufficient data. ‚ÄúWithout authentic data, can the government decide how and where to invest in skills, what kind of jobs are disappearing, and what kinds are set to appear? If the problem in India is not jobs per se, but the quality of jobs and the incomes they yield, how can sensible policies be developed with dubious data?‚Äù

Jaggannathan asks a pertinent question: How can this problem can be tackled?

The author makes a case for public and private partnership to make more frequent, quality data available. This is an important point which should be discussed at the government-level and the government‚Äôs think-tanks can closely examine this possibility to address the issue of missing numbers.

Having stated the problem, Jaggannathan makes certain recommendations to resolve India‚Äôs jobs crisis, the major thrust of which seems to be empowering small companies with better technology so that those firms can employ several more people than what they manage today. Of course, this can‚Äôt be done without conducive labour laws and a operational framework that encourages small units to be more aggressive participants in the manufacturing play.

There are mentions of higher productivity through technology as a remedy to job losses on account of automation at the top of the manufacturing food chain. The book picks certain sectors such as apparel, logistics, tourism, construction, real estate, education and healthcare as high employment potential areas.

The message of the book, written by one of India's most senior business journalists, seems to be that India needs to first acknowledge the problem of unemployment with full seriousness, avoiding pretensions and then prepare a solid roadmap for a course correction, before precious time runs out.

The book is an account of a real problem in India that some fail to understand, and some pretend not to.

"India's job crisis: Clue to employment is growth in the real sense, not just high GDP numbers","The issue of employment will not be resolved easily as the concept is amorphous given that it is hard to define who is employed or unemployed. The NSSO data that has been used in Business Standard has not been accepted as being the final document and hence is not official. But nonetheless, the revelation of the linkage with educated and skilled personnel is important as it is serious given that the unemployment numbers are scary.

The Business Standard article quoting NSSO data shows that during the period 2011-12 and 2017-18 unemployment among the educated increased sharply across males and females in both rural and urban areas. The ratio of unemployment more than doubled to 10.5 percent and 9.2 percent for males in rural and urban areas respectively and was at 17.3 percent and 19.8 percent for females respectively in rural and urban areas.

This bit of news is disturbing because we do usually talk of the concept of demographic dividend which can become a liability in case employment is not created. However, given that the NSSO defines an educated person as one with secondary education up to 10th standard, there is some comfort given that children may not be entering the workforce at that age. To this extent the unemployment numbers may be on the higher side.

The broader issue which comes for discussion pertains to the quality of education which is more important because when the youth has to enter the non-menial professions, it would be necessary to be equipped with the right qualification. It has been noticed in India that education is not homogenous and there is no singular curriculum that is followed across the country.

There are state differentials, and even within the region, there are differences in the approach to education which can be English based on regional language based. The latter stand fewer chances in the competitive world and end up at the lower levels as competition too is very high. The NSSO should probably firm up the concept of educated youth to get a better sense of the status of employment.

The report also points out that the situation among those who have been skilled through vocational training is not very different. Two features have been highlighted. The first is that the ratio of those who received training came down to 2 percent from 2.2 percent which could be because of a higher base of educated youth. Second, the unemployment rate here too is worrisome as it has doubled to 12.4 percent in FY18 as against 5.9 percent in FY12.

Here it can be argued that the fall in the ratio of those who received such training can also be attributed to the fact that today with the advent of technology and access to viewing the good life, students may not be willing to go in for jobs such as carpenters, plumbers, electricians, etc. once they deem themselves to be educated. It becomes the last resort as the majority of youth aim for an office job where manual skills are not required. This is a major challenge especially with the lower income group where the aspiration is to do better in life with unemployment being preferred to doing such jobs.

Addressing these issues is important because while headline numbers are definitely eye-catching, the unemployment ratios within the educated and skilled classes are alarming. It brings to the fore the fact that having rudimentary education and acquisition of menial skills may not be adequate to find jobs which ideally should be increasing with the spread of urbanisation and growth.

Normally growth in the housing sector should lead to higher demand for masons, electricians, plumbers etc. and the retail boom should require more hands on the loom. Here the explanation is that with the advent of technology there has been a strong case of labour displacement with fewer hands being required and productivity increasing. In a way, the stringent labour laws act as a deterrent for small firms which do not want to hire too many people.

Hence while the issue of unemployment will continue to dominate agendas of government the answer is to revamp the education system and make the skills job oriented. This is a very big task because overhauling the entire education system is not possible but as long as there are initial differences in quality of education, the inequality will carry on through the life cycle right up to the time one acquires skills. Education in an Indian language from a government school (which is the only available facility in most of rural India) cannot get a child education in a better-rated college which in turn makes it even more difficult to get professional education. These anomalies have to be corrected or else the problem will only deepen.

On the other side, the youth also has to be more adaptable and settle for jobs with rudimentary skills and not wait for office or delivery boys‚Äô opportunities. The fact is in most advanced industries companies are working on models of limited human interface with greater reliance on technology. Making inroads will be difficult. It will be more a case of the new industries like e-commerce including retail which do require human beings for the last mile and would be willing to take on more labour. This is where the conundrum lies as it has been observed that all such industries start in a big way but do lead to consolidation at some point of time with this kind of labour becoming less relevant.

The clue to unemployment is growth in the real sense and not just having high GDP numbers. There needs to be more sectors growing which employs more people who in turn consumer more thus keeping the spiral moving. It is a hard task given that for the last three years, the economy had been confronted with a series of disruptions that have come in the way of growth.

Why a full-blown unemployment crisis is awaiting India‚Äôs next govt; political theatrics may no longer work to hide the problem,"Two recent studies about the unemployment/financial situation of the average Indian worker, conducted by separate independent agencies, offer further disturbing evidence about India‚Äôs worsening job situation. The first is from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which said at 7.2 percent, the country‚Äôs unemployment rate in February was worst in at least 29 months when labour force dwindled 25.7 million since September 2016. Another study conducted by S&P said about 83 percent women in India and 87 percent of men are worried about their financial future, presumably because of lack of employment.

Now these aren‚Äôt the only warning signals about the job situation. We have the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) survey pointing out the grim employment situation. It says the unemployment rate for skilled persons in the country doubled to 12.4 percent in 2017-18 from 5.9 percent in 2011-12 and the number of jobless among the educated, too, went up. Note that the literacy rate showed an upward movement at 76.9 percent in 2017-18 from 74.7 percent in 2011-12.

In October last year, a report from Indian rating agency CARE revealed that job growth in corporate India moderated to 3.8 percent in fiscal year 2018 from 4.2 percent in the previous fiscal and the problem is most severe with smaller companies. The report, based on an analysis of over 1,600 corporates, said smaller companies with net sales of less than Rs 500 crore have witnessed a contraction in employment growth, while larger companies with over Rs 500 crore sales had positive employment growth in 2017-18.

The point of citing all these studies/reports is to emphasise that the unemployment problem in Asia‚Äôs third largest economy is neither a false alarm nor a hollow political charge, but a problem too real to ignore at least now.

The Narendra Modi government, not too fond of criticism, has been defending the problem of job deficit by picking the methodology that suits its counter narrative, using the EPFO-based methodology. But there is an issue with that. The EPFO-based employment mapping does not capture data in the informal sector but other studies like CMIE base their findings on household surveys to arrive at the unemployment figures.

Second, there may have been a spike in new EPFO registrations, but many of them may not be active accounts. What this means is that not all the new registrations may be of people currently employed. Experts have cited some more issues of using EPFO data-based methodology to calculate employment/unemployment figures. So holding the EPFO shield to defend joblessness may not be a good idea.

The issue of unemployment isn‚Äôt confined to theory but is beginning to be felt on the ground. The evidence lies in continuing agrarian protests, spike in demand for rural employment guarantee schemes and even a subject of mob fury. Unemployment also leads to other social disorders. A recent Firstpost ground report said in states like Bihar, where joblessness is at multi-year high, the youth are increasingly resorting to illicit liquor trade to make money.

Indeed, as many experts have already pointed out, the employment situation also raises questions on the true state of the gross domestic product (GDP) numbers that suggests a sustaining 6.5-7 percent growth in recent years. The recurring question is, how can a high-growth economy not create jobs. Obviously, there is no quick solution for India‚Äôs unemployment crisis especially when the only element that has been pushing overall growth presently is government spending. For well-known reasons, private sector investors remain on the sidelines.

While, till recently, the focus of the national political discourse has been on critical economic issues, attention has been diverted for logical reasons in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attacks and subsequent developments. The unemployment situation is likely to worsen going ahead with no serious attention, except for freebies and attention-diverting tactics, to address the problem. Diverting attention from the job crisis, or pretending that the problem doesn‚Äôt exist at all, will be the next big economical blunder. Whoever wins the political puzzle in 2019 polls will have to face , a major unemployment crisis. No amount of political theatrics and attention-diverting tactics may work to pacify India‚Äôs jobless youth except real jobs.

"Jobs crisis in India spiking cynicism among youth towards politics; 'timepass generation' now puts its faith in TikTok, tequila shots","Editor's Note: This article first appeared in Issue 12 of Firstpost print.

When Vineet Chauhan graduated from Neelkanth Institute of Engineering and Technology, Meerut, with a B.Tech in 2016, he did not think that he would be looking forward so keenly to the 2019 general elections. Working for the local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate ‚Äî his family has long been a supporter of the party ‚Äî in his village in western Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Kairana parliamentary constituency has given a bit of structure to his days, which are otherwise spent in some pursuit of meaning.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what it is to be busy. Outside of my student life, I have never known what it is to have important work to do,‚Äù says 25-year-old Chauhan who has been looking for a job, but with no luck.

Everyone from Prime Minister Narendra Modi to Congress president Rahul Gandhi has been working hard to reach out to India‚Äôs first-time voters, promising employment and entrepreneurial opportunity. But underemployed, under-educated, India‚Äôs Timepass Generation has become cynical about politics and is putting its faith in TikTok and tequila shots.

There are 55 million people in the labour force with a graduate or higher degree, according to the State of Working India, 2018 report, released by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University. Almost one in six is unemployed and Chauhan falls in this category.

The facts, terrifying in their starkness, just keep piling up. Unemployment in the category of people with a graduate or higher degree is three times the national average. And more than 60 percent of the unemployed are in the 15-25 age group.

The problem is as much the unavailability of jobs as the kind of employment opportunities that this workforce feels are commensurate with their skills and degrees. Chauhan has travelled from Meerut to Delhi to Chandigarh in search of a job, but at best, he was offered entry-level positions at private companies at a starting salary of Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000. His family spent upwards of Rs 5 lakh on his graduation. ‚ÄúEveryone keeps asking me, ‚ÄòWhat are you doing?‚Äô Lage hue hain bas (I‚Äôm trying),‚Äù he says.

In 2004-05, Craig Jeffrey, director of the Australia India Institute in Melbourne, worked with a large number of young people ‚Äúwho had acquired qualifications but been unable to secure work and lacked the skills to start businesses or find lucrative jobs in the private sector‚Äù. Jeffrey, in an email interview to Firstpost, describes these young people as being in a limbo, ‚Äústuck somehow between the modern and traditional, urban and rural, childhood and adulthood‚Äù. During the course of his research, he came across one word over and over again, ‚Äútimepass‚Äù. It became the title of his book, Timepass: Youth, Class and the Politics of Waiting in India.

At 46, Vijendra Singh is a little older than the people Jeffrey would have interviewed for his book, but he understands the phenomenon all too well. Only he doesn‚Äôt call it timepass. ‚ÄúSamay pathra sa gaya hai,‚Äù he says, the closest approximation of which is that time has fossilised for him. He holds a diploma in engineering but never got down to looking for work as the family came into money during the property boom in Ghaziabad. ‚ÄúWe did the usual things: build a big house, buy big cars. Then money ran out.‚Äù

ALSO READ: Lack of jobs is a very real challenge

Singh‚Äôs day begins at dawn with a game of badminton with other men of his village. ‚ÄúThen we sit and chat.‚Äù Politics? ‚ÄúSure,‚Äù he chuckles. The conversation usually centres on who drank what last night, who will drink what tonight. ‚ÄúThen we nap. Then we go for a walk. Then people assemble and start drinking. I realised later in life that youngsters need jobs to keep them grounded. It gives you your identity.‚Äù

Singh is a native of Sadopur village, in Ghaziabad. He and neighbour Jagbir Singh run the Ambition Library, which is akin to a study centre for the local youth. The idea was to provide a space for youngsters to prepare for government exams rather than while away time in the village. ‚ÄúA lot of people active in student political groups come from this area. They would pile these boys up in jeeps every time they needed some muscle flexing in Delhi. The centre is meant as an alternative to all of this,‚Äù says Vijendra.

Girls and boys from various academic backgrounds come to the centre. From MBAs to B.Com graduates, they are all there, everyday, in a bid to crack government service exams because that is where the real job security lies. ‚ÄúI am an MBA and even worked in a private firm for some time. But I was being paid a pittance and the workload was too much,‚Äù says Bhim Singh Nagar. He is hoping to clear the SSC exams in June.

‚ÄúThe truth of the matter is that even if you are a Group D employee, it is better than earning ‚Çπ1 lakh in a private company,‚Äù says Aakash Nagar (no relation to Bhim Singh). Aakash has a B.Tech degree from the Hi-Tech Institute of Engineering and Technology, Ghaziabad. He is a remarkably self-aware 22-year-old with strong views on the education system. ‚ÄúQuality education in this country is of very low quality.‚Äù He is under no illusion about the value of his engineering degree or what he may have learnt in the classroom. ‚ÄúThere is no push on understanding but rather about getting the degree. And colleges don‚Äôt help you in getting a job.‚Äù

The engineering college boom in India was triggered by government education loans. The proliferation of institutes with next to no quality control has long been an area of concern. According to the National Employability Report ‚Äì Engineers, 2019, prepared by Aspiring Minds, only 3.84 per cent of India‚Äôs engineers are employable in software-related jobs. And while India may be under the impression that Silicon Valley runs on engineers trained here, the US has a much higher proportion of engineers, almost four times, who have good programming skills. MBAs are not far behind. A study by ASSOCHAM had found that only 7 per cent of India‚Äôs business school graduates are employable.

The Annual State of Education Report, 2017, established that quality of education in the 14-18 age group of Indian students remains a matter of grave concern. ‚ÄúWe have generations that are growing up into an aspirational life but we are not able to guarantee a standard of living for them. Be it school level or higher, we are not doing well. Our failure to provide for the youth of the country can lead to social unrest. We may as well be sitting on a ticking time bomb,‚Äù says professor Amit Basole, an economist at the Azim Premji University.

By 2020, India is expected to be the youngest nation in the world with half of its population under the age of 25. It is this section that will shape the future of the country. But their own future remains uncertain. Pushpendra Singh, a 29-year-old with an M.Com degree had made up his mind in school itself that he wanted a ‚Äúprivate‚Äù job. He comes from a family of farmers and, while they were never poor, money was always a concern. He ticked all the boxes he thought were needed to do well: a degree, an additional skill course. But that wasn‚Äôt enough. ‚ÄúI was working in a sugar factory in Nagpur at a salary of ‚Çπ15,000 out of which rent alone was ‚Çπ5,000. I wasn‚Äôt saving any money and eventually had to return home.‚Äù Home is a village some distance away from Bareilly. He apologises for the way he speaks, a patina of local dialect with Hindi thrown in. ‚ÄúI used to speak like city people when I studied in Bareilly. Now, I talk like everyone else in the village,‚Äù he says ruefully. Singh understands the concept of timepass very well though he says not all days are like that. ‚ÄúThere are seasons when we are busy and then there are seasons when we are not.‚Äù Playing cards and going to neighbouring villages to meet relatives are the two principal ways in which he and other young men in the locality spend their time. ‚ÄúThe elders taunt us, ask us why are we not working, why are we doing tapribaazi (goofing off). It‚Äôs humiliating but I don‚Äôt have an answer for it.‚Äù

An increasingly dissatisfied educated youth population will have a big impact on the social, economic and religious fabric of a society like India‚Äôs. The recent agitation by Jats and Patidars, traditionally well-off communities, for reservation can be seen through this lens.

In the Ambition Library centre, for instance, there is deep resentment against caste-based reservation with students feeling that it should be stopped once a family has managed to lift itself up by the bootstraps. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get a foot in the door otherwise,‚Äù says Aakash. Unemployment and underemployment, especially after the NSSO data leak, had ‚Äúthe potential to be the biggest electoral issue for these elections but neither the government nor the Opposition is interested in highlighting it. The youth of the country, on the other hand, feels completely abandoned,‚Äù says Anupam (who goes by only one name) of Swaraj India. The party has started a Yuva Halla Bol campaign against the SSC paper leak that also works with young people on issues of unemployment.

While unemployment has become a simmering concern, Anupam is right when he says that the mainstream political parties aren‚Äôt really addressing it. The Congress in its manifesto has promised a new ministry of industry, services and employment apart from filling in all the 20 lakh vacancies in government jobs. The BJP has not made any concrete claims, for its part, but has vowed to increase investment for job creation. But how will the issue end up impacting voting behaviour of the unemployed youth in the coming weeks? Voting behaviour still seems to be dictated by caste concerns rather than economic ones. Most of the people interviewed by Firstpost did not seem to hold the government or any party directly responsible for the mess they find themselves in.

‚ÄúIn the current cycle of elections, the unemployment issue has manifested itself in rallies for reservation. Political mobilisation still follows caste lines,‚Äù says Basole.

Lack of employment can bring about a strong sense of dislocation as well as identity crises, particularly in a society as hierarchical as India where secure, sustained employment is often seen as a ticket out of penury. Increasingly, this has also started impacting the wedding prospects of young men, with most families and girls preferring a stable government job as opposed to farming or even private sector employment. Faced with the lack of all these factors, can caste and religious identities start taking hold, leading to unrest?

‚ÄòYouth bulge‚Äô and its impact on society has been a subject of much research with one extreme view, as posited by German demographer Gunnar Heinsohn, stating that there are links between violence and an increasingly young population. This theory, however, has been contested. Professor Jeffrey feels that there is also evidence to show that ‚Äúeducated unemployed or underemployed young people can play constructive roles‚Ä¶the world has changed so much since middle-aged Indians were growing up. In this context, young people in their twenties often play a key role as a type of ‚Äòintermediary generation.‚Äô They advise their younger peers on issues such as career choices, education, health care, relationships‚Ä¶young people act under the radar to assist youth in their neighbourhoods‚Äù.

A prime example of this would be someone like Ashish Patwa, a resident of Gorakhpur. Patwa holds several degrees (‚ÄúBA, MA, B.Ed, I have done it all‚Äù) but works in his father‚Äôs cotton store as he says he never had good enough grades to really qualify for anything. ‚ÄúI advise young men on career options and choices quite a bit. My degrees give me a certain standing in society and I do feel that they have expanded my horizon.‚Äù

The leaked NSSO data reveals that unemployment in India was at a 45- year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. In such a scenario, Vineet Chauhan is hoping that his involvement with the local politician may lead to employment opportunities before existential crisis swallows him whole. ‚ÄúEveryone needs astitva (a sense of being). Without work, life is meaningless.‚Äù

"The mental health cost of an economic slowdown in India: 'My hope is dying, I feel isolated and depressed'","‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what lies ahead in the future. I am still trying to find a job but my hope is dying. I feel isolated and depressed,‚Äù says Jyoti, a 24-year-old with a postgraduate degree in business studies. ‚ÄúEvery time I read about the economy of India, it is barely happy news.‚Äù Like Jyoti, many are worried about the depleting state of the Indian economy. Despite being consoled by the Home Ministry, that it is temporary, the consequences of an unstable economy on psychosocial well-being cannot be overlooked.

From 6.6 to 4.5 percent in gross domestic product, the country‚Äôs economy propelled into an insidious slowdown. Reportedly it is carrying with itself a demonising inflation, a job crisis with the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, and a subtle possibility of a recession as recently warned by Nobel laureate, Abhijit Banerjee. What this means to the common individual is evident in the context of livelihood but in India, less attention has been given to the mental health outcomes of the poor economy.

The first step to exploring this connection stems from recognising the mental health of a person as a significant contributor to a nation‚Äôs economic capacity. Mental health is an amalgam of biological, psychological, social, interpersonal and occupational functioning which is eventually responsible for growth not just of the individual alone but also of the community they are a part of. Hence, in this context, mental health is equivalent to being addressed as mental capital.

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognises economic crisis having a major role in the development of mental health problems. In a report that studied this impact in the European continent highlighted a reciprocal relationship between poor mental health and economic depletion. Unemployment, poverty, job insecurity, inflation are all drivers of poor mental health outcomes but conversely mental health issues also affect economic growth.

The ‚Äúsigns and symptoms‚Äù

The overall economic slowdown shows up into the perils of mental turmoil in ways it is associated with people's lives ‚Äî be it about jobs, affordability or other financial matters such as debts. Unemployment becomes one of the primary ‚Äúsymptoms‚Äù that lead to mood-based issues such as depression and anxiety or an increase in consumption of substances such as alcohol.

In the month of December, the unemployment rate in India escalated to 7.7 percent as per the data released by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Synchronising to this information, 14 percent of all the suicides recorded by the National Crime Records Bureau in 2018 were due to joblessness.

It is likely for companies and organisations to lay off employees in large numbers to survive economic slowdowns causing a surge in stress that may escalate quickly. Major firms such as OYO, Cognizant and OLA have reportedly let go of many employees as a result of this decline. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I am suicidal but I am definitely on that path,‚Äù says Vaibhav*, an IT worker based in Delhi who was recently a part of a massive lay off in one of the companies. ‚ÄúI am applying to other places but this has affected what I think of myself and my abilities.‚Äù

Feelings of worthlessness, helplessness, insecurity, loss of autonomy become primary markers of distress caused by mass unemployment rates. Research on mental health impact of recessions in Spain has highlighted such feelings among people who were laid off following a negative labour demand shock ‚Äî an abrupt downfall in demand of workers.

‚ÄúWhat the slow economy does is that it really intensifies the already prevailing ideas of capitalism. It asks people to work harder than ever before. Competition is not only implied but normalised, promoted as the only way to be,‚Äù says Radhika Sharma, a Mumbai-based psychiatric social worker. ‚ÄúWhat workplaces tell people about themselves becomes a strong voice that guides their sense of self and their identity.‚Äù

Other than joblessness, job-burnout is also a critical consequence of economic slowdown. Now recognised as a diagnosable condition as per WHO, burnout is a prolonged response to workplace stress, characterised by emotional exhaustion, detachment from customers/clients and feelings of personal inefficacy. In the 2008 slowdown in India, employees belonging to manufacturing and healthcare sectors suffered moderate to high levels of burnout.

‚ÄúOne of the primary feelings that I work with in therapeutic conversations is that of ‚ÄòI am not good enough‚Äô. Where did this really come from? With dwindling jobs and economy, where is the space to even think about these links? As always with the economy taking a hit, we see mental health being pushed to the margins,‚Äù Radhika adds.

Who will suffer the most?

3,92,705 is the projected number of farmer suicides between 1995-2020 as predicted by PC Bodh, an Indian Economic Officer (1987 Batch) in his recent book, Farmer Suicides in India: A Policy Malignancy. There have been debates whether farmer suicides are mental health or an economic issue but this polarisation does not benefit anyone. Rather there is a push for a narrative which views mental health as both an economic and eventually a political issue.

Farmers remain one of the most adversely affected groups of a poor economy in India despite their ample contribution to the country's growth. Additionally, people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and those intersecting with other marginalisations are bound to experience more distress resulting from economic strains. As per the report by WHO, these groups include but are not limited to children, single-parent families, ethnic minorities, migrants and older people.

‚ÄúThere is a whole lot of data telling us that mental health and economic class are deeply interlinked. So are other factors such as caste and gender. It is indeed very likely for people belonging to such sections to be on the primary receiving end of such blows,‚Äù Radhika adds, reflecting on the populations likely to suffer the most from a bad economy.

A population usually left out of such discussions includes women working in informal sectors. In a paper, Indra Chakravarthi highlights the plight of women and how their working conditions affect physical and mental health. The paper quotes, ‚ÄúThe impact on women‚Äôs health, of the double burden of poor working conditions as well as of taking care of families with such poor wages, its implications for access to essential goods and services, can only be understated.‚Äù

‚ÄúInformal sector is a whole different gamut,‚Äù Radhika says. ‚ÄúHomemakers yet another. I also do know that many mothers I work with are finding it harder to get back to jobs after having children or having to work harder if they find a job to prove their relevance.‚Äù

It is not surprising to note that in a world dominated by capitalist thought more people seem to be worried about how a person‚Äôs deteriorating mental health will prove to be a ‚Äúburden‚Äù on the country‚Äôs economy instead the other way around. The question remains: what solutions are suggestible to fight this deeply complex malady?

While psychotherapy and medications account for primary responses to issues, they only operate on the surface. Radhika advocates for changes on the larger scale to reach the roots of the problem. ‚ÄúWe definitely need systemic level changes to support people‚Äôs personal journeys of healing. Else, sustainable well-being will always continue to remain a challenge. People who have access to modes of healing such as therapy struggle to meet challenges when they go outside because the outside world (for eg, economy) continues to fail them by pushing the finish line farther and farther away.‚Äù

Jaipur: In Rajasthan, the shock of demonetisation and GST, along with the lingering effects of the enactment of Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) Act and the ban on illegal sand mining, have all contributed to a slowdown in the real estate sector, traditionally one of the bigger employment providers.

RERA is meant to regulate the real estate market and protect homeowners from dubious dealers. While the industry has welcomed regulation, teething troubles with RERA have exasperated the larger slowdown. Apart from the unorganised sector, which has taken a hit across the country, the working class associated with the sector is also bearing the brunt of these upheavals.

""Investors have stopped putting money in real estate since 2017 as they do not see any returns,"" said Surendra Shah, a city-based Chartered Accountant. ‚ÄúBanks have reduced funding for builders by over 50 percent due to unsold inventories and less cash flow. The recession in the real estate sector is causing acute rural distress because most of the labour was engaged in construction and are now out of work.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is a huge crisis in real estate in Rajasthan,‚Äù said Preetosh Kumawat, a city-based civil engineer. ‚ÄúThe industry was mostly cash-based. Now with demonetisation and GST, builders cannot take cash from buyers, so less construction is happening. Nearly 80 percent of new civil engineers are looking for government jobs or have shifted to other fields in the last three years. Their salaries are also not as per expectations,‚Äù Preetosh added.

With educated civil engineers facing unemployment, the plight of unskilled daily wage workers can be imagined. Jai Prakash Ramawat, a city-based contractor, pointed out that not only has hiring dropped, the labourers‚Äô wages have also taken a hit. ‚ÄúA year back, I used to hire about 2,000 labourers every day for 10-12 projects running simultaneously across the city. Now I hire just 1,000-1,200 labourers per day.‚Äù

A group of severe cost-cutting measures is another factor adding to unemployment. ‚ÄúWhere earlier, we used to hire three people, we hire one now,‚Äù said Mohit Jain, a Jaipur-based builder. ""The industry is now forced to optimise its use of resources. We can no longer afford to keep a worker when there is no work, earlier we could.""

Auctions for projects by the Jaipur Development Authority are also down. ‚ÄúAuctions have not taken place as there is no liquidity,‚Äù said Umang Sawalka, managing director, Shivgyan Group. ‚ÄúSales have also slowed leading to unused inventory.‚Äù

One ban on top of another

The Government of India enacted the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 with the aim to bring more transparency in the existing system and protect the interests of home buyers. All the provisions of the Act came into force in Rajasthan in May 2017, only the third state at the time to have implemented it after Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.

A month later, the then Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje launched the website and it became mandatory for all the builders and real estate agents to register on the website and upload details of all ongoing projects. Consumers wishing to register their complaints against a real estate company/project can do so with the regulatory authority, even if the company has not registered on the portal.

The implementation of RERA led to the dissolution of several small and unregulated builders who were solely working on cash. Such builders would sometimes announce project but stall them past several deadlines but now, under RERA, they have to deliver the project on the date they have promised. This had an impact on the number of new projects. While the industry has welcomed RERA, it has perhaps come at a bad time, compounding other major disturbances to the ecosystem.

Like, with bajri ban in place (the Supreme Court had banned sand mining in 41 blocks across Rajasthan in November 2017 as they were being run without adequate environmental clearances), builders are using stone dust as an alternative. ‚ÄúStone dust is a common source in metro-cities but is now being used in Rajasthan,‚Äù said Sawalka. ‚ÄúBut skilled labour that knows how to use stone dust is not easily available. And no one wants to hire unskilled labour for this.‚Äù

Every builder and contractor says the number of projects, big and small, has come down. Even the number of personal homes being built is down. Also, ‚Äúindividuals want their homes to be built using sand, the mining of which is now banned. So, workers who used to work in sand mining are now unemployed,‚Äù Ramawat added.

Labour and manpower issues, like stringent labour laws, are leading to mechanisation, which is further denting the labour market ‚ÄúConstruction is one of the largest employers after agriculture and there is a recession in construction,‚Äù said Anand Mishra, managing director, Trimurty Builders, a Jaipur-based building company. ‚ÄúThough post RERA, things are improving, many developers have left the market,‚Äù Mishra added.

For Mukesh Saini, 19, who arrives at the Ajmer Road flyover in Jaipur at 8.30 every morning looking for casual labour, this means he now has to wait in vain. About 200 labourers gather every day at such spots, called chauktis, waiting to be hired by contractors for Rs 350-400 a day. Saini, an eighth-class pass, hasn‚Äôt found work for the past 10 days but remains hopeful as he arrives there without fail every morning. Hailing from Karauli district, he came to Jaipur after his father passed away. ‚ÄúI have been a daily wage labourer for the last three years,‚Äù said Saini. ‚ÄúEarlier, I would get work 25 days a month. But now, it is barely 15 days a month. It has become difficult to pay my room rent of Rs 2,000 per month.‚Äù

The one bigha of land his family owns in the village provides no income. ‚ÄúThere is no water, how can I grow crops?‚Äù asks Saini, who has a mentally ill mother to support. ‚ÄúNow, here also, there is no money. I do not know where to go.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe sit here at the labour hub all day most of the time, and sometimes go at half the rate if we get work in the second half of the day,‚Äù said Monu Rao, 20. Some labourers come from nearby villages and towns every morning while many others have chosen to live in the city, four to five labourers to a room, hoping to get enough work to support the families they left behind in their village.

Rajasthan loves ‚Äòjob talk‚Äô before elections

Unemployment is reaching alarming proportions in the state. Real estate and construction, gems and stone and sand quarrying used to be the biggest employers in the informal sector. But all sectors have been hit equally hard, causing high unemployment. A February 2019 report by the Ministry of Labour and Employment indicates overall unemployment of 75.79 lakh such workers across the country out of which eight percent, or 6.03 lakh workers, are in Rajasthan.

Job creation and self-employment have been a major promise during elections for the last two terms. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his election campaigns in 2014, had promised one crore job creation every year for the next five years. In addition to this, Rajasthan's former chief minister, Vasundhara Raje, during state elections in 2018, claimed to have created 15 lakh jobs in the state.

This was, however, heavily countered by PCC chief, Sachin Pilot, who called the claim 'a white lie'. Furthermore, Congress had promised to work on job creation and farmer issues during the first 100 days of its rule in Rajasthan. ""The policies by NDA government were such that employment generation did not happen. The GDP has also been low, and they manipulated the debt series to showcase that the GDP has grown. Further, policies like demonetisation and GST resulted in layoffs. There has been job destruction in place of job creation. About 10 million youth, who were earlier working, is currently unemployed. Employment generation and the boost to MSMEs will be part of the manifesto on Congress this election,"" said Archana Sharma, state vice president, Congress.

Several months down the line, labourers like Kamal, 36 ‚Äî who works on installing sewage pipes ‚Äî continue to earn far less than the bare minimum of Rs 50,000 per year which families like his need to survive, he says. ‚ÄúYesterday, my child asked me for ten rupees to buy a packet of biscuits as there was less food. I have been unemployed for the last five days. I could not give him ten rupees and milk is also expensive,‚Äù said a tearful Kamal. Kamal‚Äôs work continues to be dangerous but now, more people are available to do it for less. ‚ÄúI go down 20-25 feet with a person holding me from the surface,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúDigging one khadda takes 1-2 days, and I have two children. Tell me, what will they get if anything happens to me?""

Sadly, the labourers‚Äô woes don‚Äôt end there. Even if someone hires them at the chauktis, there is no guarantee that they will get paid at the end of the day. ‚ÄúThere are some areas from where employers who are not willing to pay come to hire us,‚Äù said Girraj Mali, a 28-year-old labourer from Lalitpura. ‚ÄúWe mostly avoid going to those areas but sometimes do if there is no other work. The police do not help us at such times, saying ‚Äòwe did not ask you to go and work for this person‚Äô or ask for a bribe.‚Äù

"India's unemployment crisis: 1.3 million youth need jobs every month, eight million a year, says World Bank report","By Chaitanya Mallapur

Mumbai: More than eight million jobs are required every year for India to keep its employment rate constant, as its working-age population (above 15 years) is increasing by 1.3 million every month, a new study has found.

India's employment rate has been declining due to women leaving the job market, according to a World Bank report, 'Jobless Growth?', published on 15 April, 2018.

While the male employment rate in India between 2005 and 2015 declined ‚Äúvery little‚Äù, the female employment rate declined by nearly five percent per year, data show.

India‚Äôs employment rate was 52 percent in 2015, below Nepal (81 percent), Maldives (66 percent), Bhutan (65 percent) and Bangladesh (60 percent) but above Pakistan (51 percent), Sri Lanka (49 percent) and Afghanistan (48 percent).

The working-age population, aged 15 and above, across South Asia is expected to increase between eight percent and 41 percent by 2025.

‚ÄúTo reap the benefits of ‚Äòdemographic dividend‚Äô, sufficient new jobs need to be created,‚Äù the report said.

South Asia re-emerged as the world‚Äôs fastest-growing economy with growth of 6.3 percent in the last quarter of 2017 and 7.2 percent in the first quarter of 2018. The region‚Äôs growth is attributed to India‚Äôs economic resurgence, post the slow down due to demonetisation and implementation of goods and services tax to 7.3 percent in 2018 (based on forecast). About 80 percent of South Asia‚Äôs gross domestic product is generated in India, the report said.

Growth, however, is not the only factor to achieve higher employment rates enjoyed by other developing nations, particularly among women, the report argued.

‚ÄúMore than 1.8 million young people will reach working age every month in South Asia through 2025, and the good news is that economic growth is creating jobs in the region,‚Äù Martin Rama, World Bank South Asia Region chief economist said.

‚ÄúBut providing opportunities to these young entrants while attracting more women into the labour market will require generating even more jobs for every point of economic growth.‚Äù

The battle for jobs continue

As many as 18.3 million Indians were unemployed in 2017, and unemployment is projected to increase to 18.9 million by 2019, according to The World Employment and Social Outlook‚ÄìTrends 2018 report by the International Labour Organisation, released on 22 January, 2018.

There is widespread resentment among youth with lack of employment opportunities in the country.

The situation seems to be grim, considering the number of people applying for government jobs. Over 28 million applicants are expected to appear for 90,000 jobs offered by the Indian Railways this year, The Times of India reported.

More than 200,000 candidates were competing for 1,137 police constable vacancies in Mumbai, many of whom were over-qualified: 423 had degrees in engineering, 167 were Masters in Business Administration and 543 were post-graduates while the basic qualification required for the post was a pass in 12th standard.

As many as 590,000 jobs every month‚Äìor 7 million annually‚Äìwere likely to be generated in 2017-18, according to a report, Towards A Payroll Reporting in India, published on 15 January, 2018.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had claimed that lies were being spread about lack of jobs quoting new but contested data, FactChecker reported on 29 January, 2018.

Over 100,000 jobs in the second quarter of 2017-18, double that in the first quarter

About 136,000 jobs were added in the July-September quarter of 2017, more than double the number added (64,000 jobs) in the previous (April-June) quarter, Santosh Kumar Gangwar, minister of state (independent charge) for labour and employment, informed the Lok Sabha (lower house of Parliament) in his reply on 2 April, 2018 based on the seventh round of quarterly employment survey (QES) report released on 12 March, 2018.

The April-June quarter had seen a 65 percent decline in addition of jobs over January-March 2017 quarter (185,000 jobs).

The QES measures employment across eight major sectors‚Äìmanufacturing, construction, trade, transport, education, health, accommodation/restaurants and information technology/business process outsourcing. The eight sectors account for 81 percent of total employment units having 10 or more workers. The report covers 11,000 units across 36 states and union territories.

The manufacturing sector added the most (65 percent) jobs between July and September 2017, followed by education (15 percent). Construction was the only sector that saw job losses.

Jobs added during the demonetisation period

As many as 122,000 jobs were added during the October-December 2016 quarter that witnessed demonetisation, an increase of over three times (281 percent) compared to its previous quarter that added 32,000 jobs.

Further, 185,000 jobs were added in the following January-March 2017 quarter, which sustained the demonetisation impact and slowed down the economy, an increase of nearly 52 percent over the October-December 2016 quarter.

‚ÄúHuman capital is now the fastest-growing component of India‚Äôs wealth,‚Äù Ejaz Ghani, lead economist at the World Bank wrote in Mint.

‚ÄúInvesting in people through healthcare, quality education, jobs and skills helps build human capital, which is key to supporting economic growth, ending extreme poverty, and creating more inclusive societies,‚Äù he said

Unemployment crisis in India: Why BJP's 2014 election manifesto promising jobs has remained only a political document,"Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) in its 2014 manifesto ‚ÄòEk Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat‚Äô promised to strategically develop high impact domains like labour-intensive manufacturing (viz. textile, footwear, electronics assembly, etc.) and tourism to enhance employment.

BJP, then in opposition, wanted to strengthen the traditional employment bases of agriculture and allied industries, and retail -through modernization as well as stronger credit and market linkages. The classy manifesto which was only a political document to be tossed in media boasted about harnessing the employment opportunities by upgrading the infrastructure and housing, and by empowering the youth for self-employment - incubating entrepreneurship as well as facilitating credit.

To the opposite, the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), a central agency tasked with carrying out large-scale surveys, has found unemployment in the country at a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in a recent report. ""EPFO's real data shows a sharp increase in jobs, created in just the last 15 months,"" the official handle of BJP tweeted, referring to data from the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation.

NITI Aayog claimed that the variability between the computer-assisted data collection methodology and NSSO survey may arise, it further suggested to not compare the data sets. ""EPFO data shows 4.8 million additional jobs have been created. The issue is just with high-quality jobs,"" NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant jumped to rescue the Modi government.

It was quite humorous as well as shocking to observe Amitabh Kant taking names of private employers Ola and Uber to justify job generation and then polishing the justification with an appendage of qualitative employment. It is to be believed that the Modi government is unaware of the fact that among 93,000 candidates who applied for peon jobs with Class V eligibility in Uttar Pradesh were 3,700 PhD holders.

‚ÄúI will not comment on the NSSO report. Don't force me,‚Äù said infuriated NITI Aayog V-C Rajiv Kumar. He further rued, ""confusion is created by some who are using a draft report. If it is a draft report, it cannot be said that the government is not releasing the data.‚Äù Ok, let‚Äôs drop NSSO draft report and talk about something else, maybe?

Quarterly Quick Employment Surveys conducted by Labour Bureau during 2016 and 2017 observed that there was a sharp decline in the major sectors like health, education, trade, transport and construction. Health sector saw a decline from 0.33 lakh in 2016 to 0.02 lakh in 2017, education sector faced a reduction in figures from 0.51 lakh to 0.18 lakh over a year. Transport sector and construction sector saw an unprecedented decline from 0.17 and 0.23 lakh respectively to 0.01 Lakh.

According to the Ministry of Labour and Employment, State/UT-wise unemployment rate for graduates and above (aged 18-29 years ) in the country from 2015 to 2016 was staggering 18.4 percent. This is way higher than an average 6.1 percent pool what NSSO draft projects.

Two independent members of the National Statistical Commission have resigned after central government allegedly failed to publish a report on employment. Chairperson PC Mohanan‚Äôs resignation is drawing sharp speculations. The term of Mohanan and Meenakshi was to end in June 2020.

National Statistical Commission has seven members, three posts were already vacant, now leaving only Amitabh Kant and chief statistician Pravin Srivastava on the board. Now, Amitabh Kant has full opportunity to become India‚Äôs next PC Mahalanobis. NITI Aayog may also now work on scrapping Usual Principal Status (UPS) approach to calculate the unemployment rate so the blind public can be flooded with favourably inflated data.

Modi government in August last year strolled to the new series for GDP calculation with the base year changed from 2004-05 to 2011-12. For example, India‚Äôs GDP growth was displayed at 10.08 percent in FY07 under the back-series calculation, up from 9.57 percent estimated earlier.

When government faced backlash over this, the ministry of statistics and programme implementation (MoSPI) released a statement saying that the committee used the production shift approach and came out with some experimental results to see how the approach compares with the earlier series. ‚ÄúThus, estimates in the report were not official estimates and are meant only to facilitate taking a decision on the appropriate approach,‚Äù said the statement.

It now appears that it has become a common tactic of Modi government to deny wrongdoings in the garb of mid-stage experimentation. After all, Modi is a practical man.

The government has failed to set up the commodity-based farmers‚Äô organisations such as Small Cotton Farmers‚Äô Estates to annex decentralised production with centralised services such as post-harvest management, value addition and marketing, for facilitating institutional support and leveraging direct farmer-consumer linkage against NCF‚Äôs recommendation.

Where the public investment in agriculture-related infrastructure particularly in irrigation, drainage, land development, water conservation, research development and road connectivity etc. could be pushed, the government instead to fulfilling promises has terribly succumbed to the propaganda.

BJP is not worried about loan defaulters who have engulfed lakhs of crores but it is more interested in calling Congress‚Äô loan waiver a political gimmick. It is true that loan waiver is not the permanent solution to the agrarian crisis but it it is certainly an immediate relief to many.

BJP‚Äôs 2014 election manifesto can be suitably termed a torus fracture if revisited today. Election manifesto insisted on reining in inflation by setting up a Price Stabilisation Fund and evolving a single National Agriculture Market among several other innuendos. In truth, it is shamelessness of BJP to ignore agrarian crisis for 4.5 years. If the Swaminathan Committee‚Äôs report is implemented, it may automatically resolve half of the job crisis in India.

"Political bickering over unemployment ignores real crisis; lack of jobs and counter-measures should be focus, not barbs","""Such a large number of unemployed young people in the country. There is bound to be instability. There is bound to be a crisis situation and a future government will take years to repair the damage that this government has done.""

Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma summed up the current employment scenario in India with this statement. Not only does it highlight the jobs crisis in the country, it also points to the difficulty future governments will face in turning the situation around.

That the government will create two crore jobs a year was one of the BJP's foremost poll promises, one that the Opposition does not let the party forget. The cry for the government to release data on the state of employment in the country has only become louder over the past few months, when the election season officially began.

This very data, procured by the Business Standard and published in a report on Thursday, triggered a fresh controversy that soon developed into another political slugfest, like every other issue that needs deeper analysis. According to the report, the Periodic Labour Force Survey conducted by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) found that unemployment rate in India touched 6.1 percent in 2017-18, a 45-year high.

This couldn't be any further from the NDA government's claim that its job creation is unmatched. The BJP-led NDA administration at the Centre has been in denial over the creation of employment opportunities despite various studies pointed to the crisis in the country.

Research by Azim Premji University found that India's seven percent growth rate was leading to less than one percent gain in employment, whereas in the 1970s and 1980s, growth of three to four percent was being converted to a two percent improvement in jobs. The consequence ‚Äî an unemployment rate of 5 percent in 2015, the highest in at least 20 years. The study found that unemployment was the highest among young and educated Indians.

Care Ratings , too, had pointed out that employment growth in corporate India had moderated to 3.8 percent in the 2017-18 financial year, and that jobs in smaller firms had been affected the most. The agency had said this slowdown in job growth is ""reflective of the proposition that higher economic growth is weakly translating into higher job creation"".

So much so that in 2018, former labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya had conceded that economic growth was not translating into more employment. ""The current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it... Growth is being reported, but it is not reflecting in employment generation,"" he had said, though he had tried to highlight government initiatives such as 'Skill India' to address this shortfall.

Sticking to denial, BJP president Amit Shah ‚Äî though not formally part of the government ‚Äî claimed that Dattatreya did not have details of the job created in the tourism and aviation sector when he had made the statement. Let's highlight the absurdity of his statement here ‚Äî Shah, the party chief, really implied that had more information on the labour force in the country than Dattatreya, the labour minister then.

The NSSO controversy

""#HowsTheJobs"" was Congress president Rahul Gandhi's question to the government after the Business Standard article on the NSSO report was published.

NoMo Jobs! The Fuhrer promised us 2 Cr jobs a year. 5 years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a National Disaster. Unemployment is at its highest in 45 yrs. 6.5 Cr youth are jobless in 2017-18 alone. Time for NoMo2Go. #HowsTheJobs pic.twitter.com/nbX4iYmsiZ ‚Äî Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) January 31, 2019

Never one to admit defeat, the BJP echoed US president Donald Trump to cry ""FakeNews!""

It's clear that he has inherited Mussolini's shortsightedness and has myopic understanding of issues. EPFO's real data shows sharp increase in jobs, created in just the last 15 months. Only a man who hasn't ever held a proper job & is totally jobless can peddle such #FakeNews! https://t.co/T0DHUs7IdZ ‚Äî BJP (@BJP4India) January 31, 2019

This brings us to the government's latest defence. To counter allegation of slow to no job growth, the Centre is now clinging to payroll data from the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation, even though the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy had clarified that EPFO data was not a metric of the state of employment in India. It never has been.

Surveys by the NSSO have always been considered the benchmark by which the employment situation in the country can be gauged, definitely not the number of subscriptions to provident funds. So why is the government focussing on these figures instead of coming up with ways to deal with the jobs crisis?

That the Centre was trying to stop the NSSO report from becoming public made even bigger headlines after the only two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), PC Mohanan and JV Meenakshi, resigned from the panel over the Centre's unwillingness to release the NSSO report on employment.

Even though figures may say other otherwise, the government has maintained that there is job growth in the country, and schemes such as 'Skill India' and 'Make in India' were working to this end. Why, then, is the Centre this hesitant to release the report officially? What does it have to hide?

Strangely enough, the government deployed NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar to defend the State with regard to the ""leaked jobs data"" on Thursday. He said the government had not released the data year ""as it is still being processed"". ""When the data is ready we will release it,"" he claimed.

Instead of being tight-lipped about figures related to creation of jobs, the government should show more transparency and release the report. If there, indeed, has been an improvement in employment opportunities, then the Centre has even more reason to make the NSSO report public and put all arguments to rest. If there hasn't, well, that's a different story.

Furthermore, one cannot ignore the negative impact demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) had on jobs in India, especially the informal sector. It's been over two years since the note ban was implemented and about a year and a half since the GST was brought into force and yet, it's still unclear how the government did not realise the devastating effects these measures would have on the informal sector. Or maybe it did, and this was a conscious push for the formal sector at the expense of the informal? We may never know.

This political bickering between the BJP and Congress is taking away from the real crisis that needs all this attention. What Rahul has to say about Modi and what comeback the BJP conjures should not be the focus. Instead, what measures can be taken to ensure that India's economic growth translates to employment generation should be deliberated on and implemented.

"Mamata Banerjee urges youth to 'seek for answers on growing joblessness', day after she slammed Centre over unemployment","Kolkata: A day after slamming the Centre for the highest unemployment rate in the country in 45 years, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged the youngsters to raise questions on growing joblessness.

Banerjee assured support to the youth on the occasion of the International Youth Day.

""Today is International #YouthDay. In #Bangla, we celebrate Youth Day on January 12, Swami Vivekananda's birth anniversary. I appeal to the youth, the students & the new generation: be strong and ask for answers. There is no answer to unemployment problems,"" she tweeted.

Referring to central government data that put West Bengal at the top of the states with highest GDP growth, Banerjee said unemployment in the state has dipped by 45 percent under her rule.

""Our State #Bangla has brought down unemployment by 45%. The GDP growth of #Bangla is highest in the country. My support is always with the youth, students and the new generation. May you be inspired to reach new heights,"" she said.

As per the data, West Bengal has registered a GDP growth rate of 12.58% in 2018-19 while the unemployment rate was 6.1% during the period.

Banerjee had written on Facebook on Sunday, ""Our achievement is in sharp contrast to the state of deep recession and complete policy paralysis perpetrated by Central Government leading to the significant decline of the overall growth rate of the country and highest unemployment in 45 years"".

"Hit by unemployment, Haryana youths overlook threat to life, police action to join cow vigilante groups for livelihood","Rohtak: Ironic though it may sound, the scourge of cow vigilantism in Haryana, has started generating employment, albeit with all its flaws. Notwithstanding its sixth position in the country when it comes to per capita income, the state has been reeling under a spell of unemployment forcing its young generation to latch onto jobs however risky they may be. Cow vigilante groups have hardly been part of good news but youths in dire need of jobs, choose to ignore its notorious fame.

Farm distress often triggered by inclement climate and poor irrigation facilities has compelled youths like Vijay Kumar to look for alternative employment although it's cow vigilantism.

Not qualified enough to bag a job in the private sector, Kumar, 31, today makes a decent earning after associating himself with local cow vigilante organisation Gau Raksha Dal Haryana. A resident of Haryana‚Äôs Jind district, he also gave jobs to four other youths who are senior secondary passed and were looking for jobs to tide over the financial crisis that their families were going through.

‚ÄúWe are members of Gau Raksha Dal led by Acharya Yogender Arya. We went to him for a job upon which we were given training of making cow dung and urine products and sell it in the market,‚Äù Kumar said.

The logistical support has been provided by Gau Raksha Dal Haryana.

Kumar said that he is married and also has the responsibility of other family members on his shoulders and an amount of Rs 15,000 is enough to meet with his financial compulsions.

Deepak Arya, who is a Class 8 pass and had come all the way from Karnal, 100 km away, to Jind district to work with the Gau Raksha Dal.

‚ÄúI am tasked to drive the campaign chariot of Acharya Yogender Arya, president of the Gau Raksha Dal. This chariot remains active on road during the night to chase cow smugglers and my job is to not miss the target,‚Äù Deepak said.

He said that he gets paid anything between Rs 10,000 to 15,000 per month for engaging in cow vigilantism for Gau Raksha Dal.

Similarly, Sonu Arya said that he also got a job in Gau Raksha Dal and he is tasked to prepare identity cards of cow vigilantes who are enrolled in the organisation.

‚ÄúI am a senior secondary pass but members who work for this organisation are highly qualified up to BA, MA and MBA,‚Äù Arya said.

Deepak Poonia, who is associated with Hisar's Gau Putr Sena organisation, said that his first choice is employment in the government sector.

""I have been filling up the forms of Haryana Police's Group-D posts (peon, gardener, carpenter) from last many years in the hope of getting one to live a decent life afterwards,"" he said.

However, Poonia claimed that he works voluntarily but other youths who work in such groups confessed that cow vigilantism groups take good care of them in fulfilling their monetary requirements.

""The choice is not in our hands to work for cow protection groups rather circumstances around prepare youths like me to work for them,"" said a youth in his early 30s. He has been working for cow protection for the last five years.

Acharya Yogendra Arya, chief of Haryana Gau Raksha Dal, said that his organisation has district units across the state.

‚ÄúIf you talk about employment, we have provided employment opportunities to about 3,000 youths who are well-qualified and work in institutions like schools that support our ideology on cows,‚Äù Arya said.

Explaining the module of the job, he said that there are two kinds of employees who are engaged. There are full-timers who are directly absorbed in the organisation and there is another group who work in educational institutions during the day and offer their services to the cow vigilante organisation at night. The jobs at the educational institutions are arranged by the Haryana Gau Raksha Dal on the basis of donations they receive from those academic establishments.

‚ÄúIn the day time, they do their job and at night, they patrol the sensitive spots with us on roads to check cow smuggling,‚Äù Arya said.

He said that those who do not want to go for night patrolling are given the task of treating injured cows on road. Arya said that since they do social service so in lieu of that they get support and help back from the society in form of donations and other help.

Gau Raksha Dal became a registered body in 2013 and claims to have 4,500 activists working for them across the state.

Sampat Singh, president of Gau Putr Sena, however, claimed that his organisation is surviving only on voluntary support from youths.

""Our organisation thrives on enrolment fees from volunteers who want to engage in cow protection and social activists who carry philanthropic activities,"" Sampat said.

He said that police cases on cow vigilante groups are common and it had occurred with him also but his organisation is working to save cows in letter and spirit.

""I cannot vouch for other cow protection groups,"" said Sampat, who is an MBA by qualification.

‚ÄúWe do understand the monetary aspect of youths engaged with the organisation but it is the duty of the government to make the job prospects viable,‚Äù he said.

Expressing shock on the claims of job employment, RTI activist Subhash Chander said that there are 1.5 million registered unemployed candidates in 15 districts out of 22 in the state.

Chander, who is also the editor of fortnightly newspaper India Post, said that youths are driving towards saffron organisation in pressing times and sans availability of opportunities in the government sector.

‚ÄúNo youth with a sane mind would want to associate with cow vigilante groups that contain the risk to life and police cases but the jobs provided by Gau Rakshak organisations are more like inducements to keep the activity going,‚Äù he said.

Bhani Ram Mangla, chairman of Haryana Gau Seva Ayog, said that the commission has started cow management programmes for educated youths.

‚ÄúWorking in gaushalas and related activities will soon become job opportunities for jobless youths belonging to rural areas on a bigger scale,‚Äù Mangla said.

He said that currently over 20,000 people get direct employment in 520 gaushalas in the state but there was nothing for youths with a technical background.

‚ÄúFrom animal feed management to the setting up of highly modernised dairy, the training programme will train a batch of 50 participants and give them a six-month diploma at the end of the programme,‚Äù Mangla said.

Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader Inderjit Singh observed that the youth driving towards cow vigilante organisations is a sad state of affairs.

‚ÄúIn Bhiwani district, a cow vigilante group in 2018 was trying to create pressure to register FIR against a veterinary doctor for not giving treatment to cows. Kisan Sabha had to run a parallel sit-in to neutralise that pressure building up on police,‚Äù he recalled.

The CPM leader said that if not all then certainly the most prominent organisations are thriving on donations under the patronisation of political parties who ultimately use the workforce for their goals. Singh blamed the government for not addressing unemployment issues leaving the youth with no choice but to opt for these pressure groups for livelihood.

Acute unemployment crisis

The severity of the unemployment crisis in Haryana can be gauged from the fact that for 18,000 posts of peon, gardener announced by the state government over 18 lakh youths appeared in the written test that took place in December last year. Candidates holding post-graduate degree were among job aspirants for Group-D jobs. According to RTI sought by Chander, the government provided only 627 jobs (Class III and IV) in 15 districts of the state.

Crimes by cow vigilante groups

Though the National Crime Records Bureau does not maintain any separate data on violence by gau rakshaks, but according to figures Haryana ranks second by the number of reported cases nationwide(15) since 2010.

Recently a 24-year-old Muslim youth was beaten for two hours in Rohtak in full public view over suspicion of cow smuggling.

In July last year, a 28-year-old Muslim man Akbar Khan was allegedly beaten to death in Rajasthan by an agitated mob on suspicion of cow smuggling. In August last year, Yameen Khokkhar of Titoli village in Rohtak district was thrashed by fellow villagers on the suspicion that he slaughtered a calf on Bakr-Eid. He had to flee the village with his family members to save his life. Police had registered a case against Yameen and the accused who thrashed him. On 2 August 2, 2018, in a case of mob lynching, one man was beaten to death in Haryana‚Äôs Palwal district on the suspicion of cattle theft.

"In Odisha's Bargarh, Rahul Gandhi slams Naveen Patnaik and Narendra Modi over youth unemployment","Bargarh (Odisha): Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday lashed out at Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 'failing' to provide jobs for the youth in the state.

""What has Naveen Patnaik done for the unemployed youth of Odisha? Is there anyone here who can say Naveen Patnaik or Narendra Modi gave them employment? But Modiji indulged in corruption and gave Rs 30,000 crore to Anil Ambani,"" he said while addressing a gathering in Bargarh.

Continuing his tirade against the prime minister, Rahul said that Modi talks about farmers in every meeting but does not waive farm loans. He only waives loans of rich businessmen, the Gandhi scion alleged.

Rahul asserted that his party not only makes promises but also keeps them, with regards to loan waivers implemented in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh a few hours after forming the government in these states.

""We waived loans in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. We will do the same in Odisha. We promised farm loan waiver if the Congress won the Assembly elections in Chhattisgarh. I told Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel that we must announce farm loan waiver within ten days of coming to power and I am proud to say that he did it within six hours of assuming office,"" Rahul said at the rally.

Within hours of being sworn-in as Baghel announced to waive off farm loans amounting to Rs 6,100 crore. The new government also decided to raise the minimum support price of paddy to Rs 2,500 per quintal.

In his first decision, taken within two hours of assuming office as chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, Kamal Nath waived the outstanding short term crop loans of farmers up to Rs 2 lakh as on 31 March, 2018, taken from nationalised and the cooperative banks.

Rahul's campaign is a part of the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections which is scheduled to start from 11 April and will go on till 19 May. Counting of polls will take place on 23 May.

"Maharashtra‚Äôs unemployed say MUDRA, Skill India ineffective; demand unemployment allowance, filling of govt vacancies","Pune: Vinod Kate, a 24 years old engineer from Shivali village in Beed district has been trying to find a job that would suit his educational qualification for two years, but with no luck.

When he heard of Educated Unemployed Meet being held at Beed he made sure to attend it with the hope that he might get a direction in his endeavour to search for a job. But he met over 500 youth like him who despite holding degrees, remain unemployed.

They had held the Educated Unemployment Meet in Beed district in Maharashtra on 27 January, seeking employment either in public or private sector, or at least the benefit of unemployment allowance for educated unemployed youth.

More such meets are lined up at other districts of Maharashtra, including Latur, Nanded and Pune. As the state has not been filling existing vacancies and no jobs are being created in private sector, more and more number of youths are becoming jobless despite having qualification. And hence, a few social workers under the umbrella of Surajya Sena have started organising such meets to highlight the issue.

Subhash Ware, a social activist from Pune, explained the need to highlight the need to increase employment opportunities. ""We have been interacting with youth across the state while working for anti-corruption campaign. And during our interactions, we learnt that they are in dire need of jobs either in government or private sector. No new jobs are being created and the posts that exist, are also being cut down. Economy of any nation depends on job creation,"" he said.

Yogesh Jadhav, social activist from Mumbai, said, ""There are 1.75 lakh vacancies at different posts in all government department in state, as per information I received under RTI filed a month ago. Number of vacancies in state police force is more than a lakh. And since 2012, state government has stopped recruitment for various posts, citing lack of funds to pay salaries. More number of permanent vacancies are being converted to contractual posts. Recently, the state has decided to cut down a few thousands government posts. What will the youngsters do without jobs?""

Last year more than seven lakh students appeared for Maharashtra Public Service Commission exam to fill just 69 posts.

When asked why youth should depend on government jobs only, when government schemes like MUDRA and Skill India are launched to promote self-emplyment and job creation in private sector, Jadhav said, ""We don‚Äôt claim that only government jobs are the answer to unemployment. But in USA there are 72 government employees per 1,000 people while in India the ratio remains at 14 government employees every 1,000 citizens. So the government cannot push away its responsibility and has to fill vacancies for better administration. Of course job creation in private sector is equally important.""

Vasishtha Bade, one of the organisers of the meet held at Beed, put focus on how the schemes like Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana and Skill India are utter failure on ground level. ""I have been in social work for over five years. When I applied for loan under PMMY, I was asked for security amount and guarantee of three people having account in that banks. Though government is making claims about the success of the scheme showcasing huge numbers, in reality youth find it extremely difficult to get loans from the bank under the scheme,"" he said.

Kate said, ""despite submitting all documents required by the State Bank of India in Beed, my loan under MUDRA scheme was not approved. As far as Skill India training is concerned, it's of no use. The training is insufficient to get jobs even in Beed, forget places like Pune or Mumbai. I have done a course at one of the Skill India training centre in Beed as well. My parents are farmers and toil at our small patch of land. They have been hoping that I would secure a job once I finish my college. But I have not been able to do it and I cannot see them working hard at the farm. But it is not ending anywhere. You will find many of the youth like me here in Marathwada.""

Subhash Ware said, ""Our major demands are give jobs to unemployed or give Rs 10,000 per month as unemployment allowances. Regularise those who are working on contract and also fill all vacant posts immediately. Exam fees should be lowered as per central government standards like Rs 50 or so. Recruitment in government posts should be transparent. We also want 50 percent reservation for youth from the state for central government posts that are based in Maharashtra. Everybody who applies for loan should get a loan under MUDRA scheme, and Skill India should be made more effective so that youth would get work with these skills.""

Bade said, ""we are asking such youth to fill forms with details of their qualification and we are going to send them to Chief Minister Office. We got 1,000 forms in Beed meet and we expect over 10,000 in three more meets. Then we will approach the state.""

Now Student Federation of India, Maharashtra is also organising meets for educated unemployed youth under Yuva Vidyarthi Jagar Jatha from 4 February across Maharashtra.

"Survey discontinued, Centre clueless about unemployment","The Central government may be clueless about employment in the country since 2016 as the Ministry of Labour and Employment has stopped carrying out its surveys. The Labour Bureau under the ministry has not conducted any survey to find out the actual data of employment in the country since 2016.

In a reply to a question in the parliament whether the Labour Bureau has conducted any surveys to find out the actual data of employment in the country, the union Minister of State for Labour and Employment (independent charge) Santosh Kumar Gangwar said, ""On the recommendations of Task Force on Employment, however, this survey has been discontinued.""

The minister stated that the Labour Bureau has conducted six household based Annual Employment-Unemployment Surveys (EUS) since 2010 till 2016 and reports of five rounds have been released till date. ""The report of the fifth round of Annual Employment-Unemployment Survey (EUS) was released in September, 2016,"" he stated.

The minister further pointed out that since 2016, Labour Bureau has been conducting Quarterly Employment Survey (QES) for enterprises employing 10 or more workers. Six reports of QES have been released so far.

As per the 2016 Labour Bureau report, the unemployment rate in India shot up to a five-year high of 5 per cent in 2015-16, with the figure significantly higher at 8.7 per cent for women as compared to 4.3 per cent for men. As per the report, in rural sector, unemployment rate was 5.1 per cent, whereas in urban sector, the rate was 4.9 percent under the usual principal status (UPS) approach.

Then the figures had left the Central government, which has taken a series of steps such as 'Make in India' to create jobs for inclusive growth in the country, pondering how to improve the scenarios and create jobs. But in place of creating more jobs, the government stopped carrying out the Annual Employment-Unemployment Surveys thereafter.

According to the fifth annual employment-unemployment survey at the all-India level, about 77 per cent of the households were reported to be having no regular wage or salaried person.",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-survey-discontinued-centre-clueless-about-unemployment-2591121,
"No takers for unemployment landslides, gross mismanagement","In any crisis, the most painful cost rendered is the human one. India‚Äôs unemployment problem touched its highest in the last 40 years in 2017-18, standing at 6.1%, according to the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).

This figure stood at 8.4% in August 2019, which is the highest ever. There is natural unemployment, where new job seekers entering the employment market are unable to find vacancies, which is understandable.

What is difficult to explain are man-made mass-scale job cuts. It is agonising to see jobs and livelihoods disappearing overnight as a result of judicial intervention because the legislature or the executive, or the corporate masters, did not do their jobs properly. It is not right for the pain to be borne soley by unsuspecting workers and labourers.

One of the most glaring examples of this is Goa today. It has become the face of massive livelihood loss triggered by judicial intervention. Ever since the Supreme Court abruptly cancelled 88 mining leases in the state on February 7, 2018, life has come to grinding, tragic halt for more than 3,00,000 mining dependents in Goa.

This is now no longer just an economic slowdown, but a grave humanitarian crisis as well. As a result of the mining ban, the livelihoods of more than 30% of the state‚Äôs population have disappeared with no alternatives insight.

A ban on an essential source of employment for Goa‚Äôs economy, its social fabric has been torn and ripped apart.

The supportive infrastructure comprising equipment suppliers, logistics and ancillary industry and the very crucial transport sector, have all floundered.

Goa is the only state with a unique logistical arrangement for movement of iron ore from mines to ports, unlike other states that rely on railway infrastructure for the same.

This channel involves trucks, jetties, and barges, in that order. With more than 12,000 trucks, 150 barges and ancillary units at a standstill, social and financial stress is a way of life for the mining community.

The people who had worked in this logistics chain over the years could never have imagined that overnight the ground under their feet would cave in. Today the owners of trucks and mining equipment are being hounded by banks for recovery of loans, which they cannot repay leading to a huge NPA crisis.

Among the causes of the sudden loss of jobs en masse, those because of judicial or regulatory action are the most distressing. Others resulting from the collapse of institutions because of financial mismanagement such as Jet Airways, come next.

In the case of Goa, even when coal mining leases were cancelled in 2014, there were no forecasts, as there was no financial crisis ‚Äî rather there was financial surplus for the entire value chain. There are enough studies available to indicate a direct link between crime and lack of livelihood opportunities. Studies have established that India‚Äôs Maoist movement is deeply rooted in socio-economic conditions prevalent in those parts of India with large tribal populations. It has mostly affected areas where there is a conflict between the state and the populace on the question of economic deprivation of forest produce and mining such as in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, and agriculture in parts of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

In Goa, there were only two major sources of livelihoods ‚Äî first, mining which has been going on for 400 years, and in recent years, tourism. Without these, Goa has nothing.

Any social unrest and spike in crime rate can spell doom for Goa‚Äôs tourist economy too, which has so far been characterised by friendly service and a self-restrained law and order calm observed by the Goans.

The purpose of the law is to create a conducive environment for citizens of the state. Goa, however, has become a case where the law and its interpretation have spelt doom for its residents.

This cannot become a precedent and must be addressed immediately. Situations like these need more complex solutions. It is simplistic to penalise lakhs of people for the actions of a few with the stroke of a pen. Stakeholders must come together to rescue these livelihoods before it is too late.

""Either provide jobs to unemployed youth or join them in the Berozgaari Hatao Yatra. In the last 15 years, Bihar has witnessed an unprecedented increase in the unemployment rate,"" ANI quoted Tejashwi as saying.

While addressing the crowd gathered at Bihar Veterinary College Ground in Patna, Yadav said, ""This is a fight for employment. Unemployment figures are highest in 45 years. Bihar is the youngest state but I am sad that Bihar has the highest unemployment rate in the country at 11.47%. We are fighting to provide you jobs but CM Nitish Kumar ji is busy in saving his job by selling Bihar.""

Yadav also accused the Bihar Chief Minister of ""murdering the spirit of the constitution"" by ""killing reservation.""

He also charted out his agenda to solve the problem of unemployment in the state. He said that if his party comes to power he will introduce a domicile policy in which the Bihar residents will get an 85% reservation.

""There is a need for political will to remove unemployment. We have that political will. If our government comes, we will introduce a domicile policy in which the residents of Bihar will get an 85% reservation, and we will fill the vacancies and conduct regular exams. We will set up IT Park and SEZ (Special Economic Zone) in the state."" he said.

Meanwhile, Tejashwi Yadav's elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav said that he will play the flute if Tejashwi becomes the Chief Minister of the state.

"No data on unemployment post DeMo, Govt tells Parliament","Days after a leaked government survey revealed that the country's unemployment rate stood at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent during 2017-18, Minister of State for Labour and Employment Santosh Gangwar informed Lok Sabha on Monday that the government did not have any data on the impact of demonetization on employment in the unorganised sector.

On Monday, Gangwar's ministry was asked a host of similar questions on the issue, in the backdrop of a news report, talking about unemployment rates based on the latest survey of the National Sample Survey Office.

Among them was an un-starred question by Rabindra Kumar Jena of the Biju Janata Dal. Jena asked how the government analysed and collected data on job growth, especially in the unorganised sector and if the impact of demonetization on the unorganised sector on jobs in the sector was analysed.

In his written reply, Gangwar said that the Ministry of Statistics has initiated the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with the objective to measure quarterly changes of key labour force indicators. Labour Force Participation Rate, worker-population ratio, and unemployment rate in urban areas were the key indicators.

Gangwar then added that information related to the impact of demonetization on employment in the unorganised sector is not ""maintained centrally"".

In another question, PK Biju of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), asked the minister about employment generated over the past four years and unemployment rates. In his response, Gangwar said that under the Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme, employment was generated for an estimated 14.03 lakh persons between 2015-16 and November 30, 2018. Also, 4.29 lakh persons were placed in jobs after getting trained at rural skill-training programmes.

Further, the minister informed Lok Sabha that as per the available Labour Bureau surveys, the estimated unemployment rate for persons aged 15 years and above on usual status basis in the country in 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2015-16 was 4.0 per cent, 3.4 per cent, and 3.7 per cent respectively.",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-no-data-on-unemployment-post-demo-govt-tells-parliament-2716187,
"'Country's real problem is unemployment, not population': Owaisi picks holes in Bhagwat's 'two children policy'","All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi criticised Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS )chief Mohan Bhagwat's ""two children policy"" on Saturday, citing that the country's major problem is unemployment, not population.

He further asserted that the Bhagwat's call for the aforementioned policy was to control the Muslim population, claiming that the RSS has always maintained this stand on the community.

Taking a dig at Bhagwat's proposed policy, he said, ""Shame on you! I am having more than two children and several BJP leaders have more than two children. RSS has always maintained that the Muslim population has to be controlled. This country's real problem is unemployment, not the population"".

Focusing on the issue of unemployment, he also blamed the Modi government for not providing jobs to people.

""Today the demographic dividend in India cannot be seen in any other country. You could not provide jobs to anyone in over five years of tenure. This is the reason why RSS is insisting to bring 'two children' policy. 60 percent of the population in India has people less than 40 years of age,"" he added.

He also went on to present statistical figures to strengthen his argument over the unemployment issue.

""Today's report is that in 2018 per day 35 unemployed persons committed suicide. What would you say on that?"" Owaisi said.

Addressing a gathering at the Moradabad Institute of Technology (MIT), RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said that he will support any law that calls for two children only. Bhagwat added that the policy will be applicable for all and was not in relation to any 'particular religion'.

""We feel this is the need of the hour, though it is up to the government to take the final call on this. This law will not have any relation to any particular religion and will be applicable to all,"" said the Sarsanghchalak (chief) of the RSS, at a meeting of about attended by 40 senior functionaries of the volunteer organisation.

"Crores of youths unemployed, sending rocket to moon will not feed them: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM Modi","Targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for allegedly ignoring real issues, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said that sending a rocket to the moon will not feed the youth of the country.

Addressing an election rally in Latur, Rahul said: ""Crores of youths in the country are unemployed. When the election comes, they don't talk about it. Youths are saying that they don't have any future. On the other side, he (Modi) will say look towards the moon. India has sent a rocket. It is good.""

In a veiled reference to India's moon mission Chandrayaan -2, Gandhi continued: ""Congress had founded ISRO. Rocket did not go there in two days. It took years, and Narendra Modi ji is taking its benefit. Sending a rocket to the moon will not feed the youths of the country.""

The Congress leader said that they (BJP government) have destroyed the Indian economy. ""They will talk about Kashmir, Article 370, moon but they will not utter a single word on real issues,"" he said.

The Wayanad MP hit out at the Prime Minister, saying that he is diverting the people from real issues.

""In the media, you will not read or hear about unemployment and drought. But you will see Modi is in Corbett Park, talk of moon...You will not see the issues of people in the media. Modi and Amit Shah are working to divert people's attention from real issues,"" he said.

Gandhi said that India has the highest unemployment rate in 45 years. ""2000 factories have closed. The automobile sector is ruined. All industries are collapsing but Modi will not speak a word about it,"" he added.

Taking a jibe at Prime Minister Modi's informal summit with President Xi Jinping, Mr Gandhi asked if he raised the issue of Doklam with the Chinese leader.

The second informal summit between Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Jinping took place in the historic city of Mamallapuram from October 11 to 12.

""He was sitting with the Chinese President yesterday. Both are sitting together on a table. Has Modi asked him about Doklam? Their Army came into India. Nobody asked this question. 'Make in India' is finished. Chinese companies are in India,"" said Rahul while addressing a public rally here..

""Everything you purchase, you will see 'Made in China' written over it. Has Modi asked the Chinese President this question? Factories in India are shutting down daily and Chinese youths are getting employment,"" he said.

Addressing another rally in Mumbai, Rahul Gandhi again alleged that there is a theft in the deal of Rafale fighter jet.

""The whole country knows there was theft in Rafale deal. People from the Defence Ministry wrote clearly that the PM is interfering in the deal. That is why there is guilt. The name Rafale hurts. That is why Rajnath Singh ji went to France to collect Rafale,"" he said.

The Inter-Governmental Agreement (IGA) for the procurement of 36 Rafale fighter jets was signed between the Government of India and the Government of France on September 23, 2016.

The Congress leader said that no one could run away from the truth. ""No one can run away from the truth. Neither Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah or the BJP. The truth will get hold of them,"" he added.

Gandhi's remark comes close on the heels of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh going to Paris last week for the official handing over ceremony of the first Rafale jet.

India‚Äôs job crisis can be dealt with policy interventions,"Shankar is a street vendor of cut fruits and fresh fruit juice in a Mumbai suburb. When I met him last year in December, he was a newbie in the trade. The stall had been managed till then by his other friends from his village near Allahabad. They had given it to him so that he could kickstart his career in Mumbai. But in the first week itself, he got a taste of how tough life was going to be when the local cops took away a hafta of nearly two thousand rupees.

Shankar, who is in his mid thirties, had until a few weeks earlier been working in a company in Gurugram, making 4G cables. He was part of the semi-skilled technical team that had to do the required assembling and installing.

Suddenly the management changed and the new person sacked all the outsourced workers, who were from other states, to replace them with local Haryana boys. Not knowing what else to do, like hundreds of other unemployed, Shankar decided to come to Mumbai and was now cutting fruits, a task he had no experience or interest in. Shankar says many people lost their jobs after the GST Bill came into effect. People in the other end of NCR, Noida, echo the same view and cite dozens of small manufacturing units which have shut down rendering their workers jobless.

Official estimates back the anecdotal data that one can see all around. According to data released by the Centre for Monitoring of the Indian Economy (CMIE), the ripple-effects of the twin shocks of demonetization and GST continue to impact the economy. The workforce participation rate ‚Äî which is the number of people from the working age population, who are in the labour force ‚Äî became 42.7 per cent in the first quarter of 2018-19. This was lower than the previous quarter and the same time in 2017-19. According to the CMIE, many people, especially women, simply exited the labour force when jobs became difficult after demonetization, thus shrinking the size of the labour force itself.

Several small manufacturing units shut shop after GST because it became cheaper to import and trade than manufacture locally since previous levies on imports have been removed. This creates a sticky situation for the economy because economists broadly agree that growth in the organised sector should be manufacturing-led to meet the unemployment challenge. The service sector cannot generate as many jobs as manufacturing can; hence the shutting down of factories will make it hard for those workers who have been laid off to be reemployed, because there are simply not enough new jobs being created. Ironically, before the GST was introduced, a section of economists were campaigning for it as it would create a level-playing field between manufacturing companies and service companies by making the taxes they paid uniform.

The other traditionally large employer is the government. Forever, the idea of the sarkari naukri with its attendant security and perks has attracted small town youth. The numbers applying for jobs is swelling because it now includes the newly unemployed. Last April, the Indian Railways received 2.3 crore applications for 90,000 jobs advertised. I have a ringside view of this phenomenon because I am privy to the job-search attempts of a young man, Mahesh, in Greater Noida. For the past two years, he has been obsessively applying to the UP Police, the Delhi Police, Railways, and other such jobs. Despite being in the reserved category, he is yet to make it to the next level, often stymied by open demands for bribe by doctors who have to certify his physical fitness or mysterious cancellation of the exam because the paper got leaked. Yet, he keeps applying and goes to different towns to appear for exams and interviews. Such is the power of a government job. In 2018, when the Central government invited mid-career professionals to apply for joint secretary level positions, 6,000 private sector managers, including an investment banker from the US whom I know, applied for a mere 10 positions.

But how many jobs can the government generate? Most government departments are already overstaffed. Clearly that is not the answer to India‚Äôs unemployment problem. Instead, specific policy interventions could help in the medium and long-term. Skill development programmes are important and the mismatch between what formal education offers and skills needed in the labour market should be bridged. The number of unemployed engineers is testimony to this. Entrepreneurship needs to be made easier with more hand-holding for fledgling entrepreneurs struggling to set up and stay afloat. Subsidies for capital equipment that replace labour have to be reconsidered, though in the age of AI, this will become more and more of a challenge.

Kumar‚Äôs clarification came hours after the opposition attacked the government over a National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) report that was leaked to some parts of the media.

Speaking about the report, he said, ‚ÄúThe government had not released the data (on jobs) as it is still being processed. When the data is ready we will release it.‚Äù

Kumar also clarified that it would not be correct to compare the data presented in that report with the data collected in 2011-12 because the data collection methods from both periods are different.

‚ÄúWe are using a computer-assisted personal interviewee in the new survey. It is not right to compare the two data sets. This data is not verified. It is not correct to use this report as final,‚Äù Kumar said.

According to the study titled 'Walking the Tightrope', 44 per cent of men and 30 per cent of women engineers said they faced bias due to the state or region they are from.The nationwide survey was conducted online beginning Fall 2017 among a cross section of 693 engineers across a variety of disciplines, engineering sectors and employment levels.""The report underlines the bias problems that India's engineering workplace experiences. This is the tipping point. It is a call to action for organisations to address these pressing issues,"" said Neeti Sanan, faculty, Indian Institute of Management, Udaipur, and consultant to the SWE study.

According to the study, 76 per cent of engineers reported that they have to prove themselves over and over to get the same level of respect as their colleagues.On the tug-of-war bias, it said 45 per cent of women reported that they have to compete with their female colleagues to get the one ""woman's spot"" available.""We need to start thinking of women engineers as an integral part of organisations and treat them the way their male counterparts are treated,"" said Joan C Williams, founding director, Center for WorkLife Law at University of California, Hastings College of the Law.

The study said 11 per cent of women engineers and 6 per cent of men engineers reported unwanted romantic or sexual attention or touching in the workplace.It further said despite the high level of bias that men tended to report, some significant gender differences emerged where women experienced higher levels of bias than men.It said 45 per cent of women but only 28 per cent of men reported that it was perceived as inappropriate when women argued at work, even when it was work-related.

He also debunked claims of jobless growth, saying how can a country grow at an average of seven per cent without generating employment.

Kumar also said it was incorrect to compare the PLFS data with earlier reports of the NSSO as their methodologies are different.

To a question on why Niti Aayog was holding a press conference on NSSO data, Rajiv Kumar said Chief Statistician Pravin Srivastava is out of Delhi and could not be present.

He further said that earlier the Central Statistics Office (CSO) was part of the erstwhile Planning Commission, and so ""Niti Aayog and NSSO are not completely distinct"".

Kumar also went on to say that as of now he could not conclusively say what was the unemployment rate in 2017-18.

Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who too was present at the conference, said India is creating adequate number of jobs for new entrants, but ""probably we are not creating high quality jobs"".

Kant further said that Niti Aayog's estimate shows that the country is creating 7-7.8 million jobs every year and the nature of jobs is also changing.

Citing a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, Kant said a combination of increased government spending, additional IT hiring, and increase in entrepreneurship created gainful employment for 20-26 million people between 2014 and 2017.

The Niti Aayog CEO also said that according to a study based on data collected by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) and the Tractor and Mechanization Association (TMA), over 14 million jobs have been created in the transport sector between 2014-2018.

Two members- including the acting chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) resigned this week, saying the government had not released the job numbers despite the commission's approval.

When asked what was the reason behind the resignation, Kumar said, ""People resigning may have their own reasons. They have not contacted me, neither have I contacted them"".

The NSSO report was based on data collected between July 2017 and June 2018 and is the first official survey post-demonetisation.

The news report further said that unemployment was higher in urban areas (7.8 per cent) as compared to 5.3 per cent in rural areas of the country.

Earlier, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had stated that 1.5 million jobs were lost just in the first four months of 2017- immediately after demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes.

The NSSO job report was previously planned to be released in December 2018.",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-report-claiming-unemployment-at-45-year-high-is-not-final-says-niti-aayog-vc-rajiv-kumar-2714574,
"Growth only weapon against unemployment, says Adi Godrej","Growth is the only weapon that can solve several problems like employment in India. In an interview, Adi Godrej, chairman, Godrej Group, talks about the things the new government post elections should do in terms of policy. During an exclusive chat with Swati Khandelwal, he also spoke on the steps the government should take to boost growth, as well as job creation through skilling India.

Excerpts:

In terms of policy suggest things the new government should do after coming to power?

The new government should concentrate on growth, as it can solve many problems including employment opportunities. Growth can also bring improvement on other factors too, which can increase global attention towards India. Currently, India is well positioned for growth and global investment, a factor that can help in setting up new factories and in turn generate employment opportunities.

For a growth-oriented focus, what steps should the government take?

Government interference should reduce. For instance, permissions take time, which at times gives birth to difficulties. So, permission and taxation should be brought down. My decades-long experience suggests that low rates of taxation give a boost to tax collection while it goes down when high rates of taxation are enforced. Tax collections were too low when taxes were too high. So, I feel, taxation should be planned well. Besides, if you have a look at corporate taxes, you will find that India is the country where the highest taxes are slapped on big corporates. On the other hand, China slaps lower taxes on their companies. Thus, concentration on these issues will help in boosting the pace of growth in the country.

GST has lowered taxation to a certain level, but the corporate rates are still an issue. Do you think the government will bring down in the near future?

I hope it, but don't expect that it will happen soon.

Do you think the 25bps rate cuts by RBI will give a boost to growth or are there any concerns related to it?

Inflation has been kept under control which is a good thing. I feel that they can still reduce it (rates), but the banks should pass on the benefits to its consumers. However, the banks are facing bad debt problem - there is a need to neutralise these debts - and that's why they are not transmitting it to the consumers.

Banks are facing the problem, and it's a status quo for everyone?

Yes, it does exist, but the RBI should suggest ways to banks to transmit the benefit to customers.

If seen from the macro point of view, do you think the rupee and crude levels are comfortable for India? What is your outlook on it?

Most macro-factors are good for India but the same is not happening with the global macro-factors, which can have an impact on India. I think a pick-up in the global economy by finalising the China-US trade agreement and other macro-economic factors, which are being talked about, will give a boost to the Indian economy too.

Will the geopolitical concerns and its risks, like Brexit and US-China trade issues, will have an impact on India. If yes, then at what level?

Yes, it can have an impact on India, as well. In fact, there are people who think the global economy will be hit by recession and, if it happens, it will have an impact on the Indian economy. Interestingly, the Indian economy is consumer-centric. In short, it is consumption-led and, therefore, it will have a minor impact on the Indian economy.

When it comes to India growth story than there was an expectation that we will grow and continue with the consumption-led story, but it didn't happen in true sense. Talk about the factors that will spur demand in India?

The policy is the most important factor as it will have a major impact. Thus, the government should come up with good policies and it must not be a short-sighted one. When it comes to the monsoon, it seems to be a good one this time and the previous talks of El-Nino effect have been put down and it seems that it will be a good one for India.

Suggest immediate policy intervention that is needed at this point in time to encourage demand? Also, pinpoint the factor that is hindering growth in demand?

Uncertainties in the global economy and Indian policies are responsible for it. Demand never goes up under uncertain conditions. I think these conditions will come to an end after the elections are over.

What is your vision for 'New India'?

In my vision, India's economy will be very good in future. India has turned out to be the world's third-largest economy in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP). China is number one and the US is number two economy and India that overtook Japan in terms of PPP is the third country. Apart from this, in terms of population, India will turn out to be the world's most populous country in the next 6-7 years leaving China behind. The decline in China's population will have an impact on its growth and this may help India to increase its GDP in terms of PPP. And, I expect that India, by 2050, will turn out to be the world's largest economy in terms of PPP, overtaking the US and China respectively. The US will be left behind by 2030-2040 and we will overtake China between 2040-2050. India will be able to attract the world by turning out to be the world's biggest economy in terms of purchasing power parity.

What is your vision on future jobs in India?

There are jobs but there is an absence of trained people in the country and those who are not skilled face difficulties in getting jobs. For instance, there is a lack of doctors, nurses, boiler operators and skilled construction workers in India. So, attention should be paid on skilling and training of people. At the same time, there is a need to pay attention to the education system prevalent in India, it should be made more relevant. So, by paying attention to these factors will help in creating a skilled workforce, which in turn will end the problem of job shortage in the country.

Any initiative from corporate India to skill people?

We have a budget for it. In fact, a part of our CSR budget and the company's budget is invested in skilling and training people. The budget is utilised in training and skilling unskilled people who have been hired by us. The issue emerges in case of medium and small-scale industries.",https://www.dnaindia.com/business/interview-growth-only-weapon-against-unemployment-says-adi-godrej-2741864,
How Direct Selling industry can solve India's unemployment problem,"The roar made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the country's poor employment conditions created a ripple across the nation. Keeping in mind the current scenario of Indian economy and the state of employment across the country, ""Skill India"" campaign of Prime Minister has hit the right strings.

The Industries too have realised the importance of having skilled workforce and hence there have been conscious efforts on their part to value add to the skills of their resources. ""Make in India"" is another initiative which has given impetus to all Indian origin manufacturers to invest more across various domains and has generated many employment opportunities for the people.

""Unemployment still remains one of the biggest concerns for the Government, which under the leadership of PM Modi is striving hard to generate more employment. It is not an issue that can be tackled in a jiffy. Rather, it will need a combined effort of government and industries to improve the unemployment ratio, that too over a period of time,"" believes Secretary General, Indian Direct Selling Association, Amit Chadha.

Direct Selling

Talking about Direct Selling, he adds ""Direct Selling is one industry that has been generating self-employment opportunities for about 20 years in the country. As there is no such restrictions and criteria to become a Direct Sellers, people from all walks of the society join Direct Selling, irrespective of gender, skill-set and age. A person aged 60 is as welcomed in Direct Selling as an 18 year old. Direct Selling embraces everyone with open arms.""

""Over the last two decades, this industry has made it way to every corner and strata of the country and it is getting popular with every passing day. In 2014-15, the Industry generated close to 40 lakh self-employment opportunities in the country and we expect the number to grow in the coming days,"" he further stated.

At a time when businesses are not expanding as a fast pace, the employment generation in the country has also taken a hit. In such a scenario direct selling has been one of the few industries, that has continued to make steady progress and pushing boundaries towards overall growth.

Chadha is of the view that the Direct Selling Industry has been instrumental in shaping up careers of millions of Indians, especially the unskilled ones, who could not find a place in the mainstream. This industry transforms a common man into a leader, who later on mentors thousands of people like him, helping them to be a part of the mainstream.

""What is significant is the fact that many of the successful Direct Sellers are now helping other people to set up their businesses. Clearly, it is a people's business, where one helps the other; resulting in building the nation,"" Chadha further added.

The main attraction of working in this industry is the option of flexible hours people work at their own leisure and time, without being bound to strict timelines. Many working people join Direct Selling as a supplementary earning opportunity. Direct Selling is a booming industry, a boon for an economy and employment generation towards better future. It boosts confidence of individuals and therefore leading the industry as well as the workforce involved, to a higher growth trajectory. It is an attractive option, allowing people to manage their own business with minimal outlay as well as generate an income.

""The need of the hour is to give boost to an Industry like Direct Selling that has a socio-economic impact to the lives of many. Not only it generates employment, as a result, the Industry also empowers its workforce with skill, knowledge, power to express, improving interpersonal skills and above all, lead a life of a 'leader, inspiring other to replicate their success,'"" Chadha further asserted.",https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-how-direct-selling-industry-can-solve-india-s-unemployment-problem-2226989,
"Inflation, unemployment biggest issues in Pakistan; not Kashmir: Gallup-Gilani Survey","A survey conducted by Gallup-Gilani, the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International shows that majority of Pakistanis consider the country's economy as the biggest problem instead of the Kashmir issue.

According to the survey conducted by Gallup-Gilani in four provinces of Pakistan, 53% of the country's people consider inflation as the major issue, 23% cites unemployment as the biggest problem in the country, and 4% finds corruption as the major hurdle of the country. Only a minor 8% of those surveyed consider Kashmir issue as the top priority in Pakistan.

According to the survey, the Kashmir issue ranks below inflation and unemployment as the major problem affecting the country.

According to the IANS, a total of 1,200 Pakistanis were surveyed for over a period of two weeks from October 7 to October 20, which comprised of men and women in urban and rural areas of all four provinces in Pakistan- Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan and North-West Frontier Province.

In accordance with the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, the state along with its democratic institutions are being reorganised into two Union Territories - Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh following Narendra Modi's decision to abrogate article 370 which accorded special status to J&K on August 5.

As per the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, the two union territories came into existence at the stroke of midnight on 31 October, almost three months after the Centre revoked Article 370.

Ever since the abrogation of article 370, Pakistan attempted to rake up the Kashmir issue at various UN bodies which found little support among member countries of the United Nations.

'What can govt do if people apply for jobs': Bihar minister on five lakh people applying for Group D posts,"After five lakh people applied for 166 Group-D posts in Bihar, many opposition parties including Congress blamed the BJP-JDU led government in the state for the growing 'unemployment' which lead to this situation.

However, a Bihar minister belonging to Janata Dal (United) Shrawan Kumar on Saturday responded to the accusations saying, ""what can government do if people apply for jobs?""

""People apply for jobs on their own accord. What can the government do? It's not like the government tells them to apply for a particular job. The only thing the government can do is ensure the meritorious applicants are selected,"" ANI quoted Shrawan Kumar as saying.

He also subtly blamed 'tough competition' for the problem. ""While it is worrisome, the entire world is going through a phase of tough competition,"" he said.

The five lakh applicants applied for 166 Group-D posts to work as peons, gardeners, and gatekeepers, cleaners in Bihar Vidhan Sabha.

Many candidates who applied for these posts stated that unemployment was the major reason for filing these applications.

Yesterday, Amit Jaiswal, a postgraduate student in English, told ANI that a higher education degree doesn't guarantee a basic salary of Rs 10,000 in the private sector.

Another aspirant told ANI that the youth prefer government jobs over private jobs.

The five lakh applicants applying for these jobs are mostly MBA and MCA degree holders, graduates, post-graduates.

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLA Anwar Alam held the BJP-JDU government for the rising unemployment in the state. He said, ""This situation shows that unemployment in the state is at an alarming level. I believe that the government is responsible for this situation in the state.‚Äù

Congress leader Prem Chandra Mishra also blamed the government for the current situation. ‚ÄúSomewhere there is a job crisis and a state of unemployment in Bihar. Hence the people holding MBA and BCA degrees are applying for Group D jobs,‚Äù He said.

Unemployment rate rises to 4.9% in 2013-14; increase in rural joblessness,"Unemployment rate in India rose to 4.9% in 2013-14, mainly on account of increase in joblessness in rural areas despite the government's flagship employment scheme MGNREGA.

According to the latest survey report by Labour Bureau, a wing of Labour Ministry, the unemployment rate inched up to 4.9% at all India level last fiscal, from 4.7% in 2012-13.

On the positive side, the unemployment rate dropped in urban areas to 5.5% in 2013-14, from 5.7% in the previous fiscal. Meanwhile, although 93% of the households in rural areas benefited from MGNREGA, the unemployment rate increased to 4.7% last fiscal, compared to 4.4% a year ago.

Unemployment rate among men increased to 4.1% in 2013-14, from 4% in 2012-13. Among women, it increased to 7.7% last fiscal, from 7.2% in 2012-13.

However, the unemployment rate among women came down to 12.4% in urban areas, from 12.8% in 2012-13. The study revealed that the Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) is estimated to be 52.5% last fiscal, whereas the Worker Population Ratio (WPR) is estimated to be 49.9%.

"Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, Mayawati slam BJP over unemployment","Union Minister Santosh Gangwar's comment ""there was no shortage of job opportunities and companies recruiting in North India had told him they were unable to find qualified candidates"" came in for a flak from Congress general secretary in-charge of UP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati. In a sharply worded rebuttal, Priyanka Gandhi warned the BJP leader against using North Indians to avoid taking responsibility for the economic slowdown. She also reminded Gangwar, a Minister of State (Independent) for Labour and Employment that jobs had been lost because of the recession brought about by the wrong policies of BJP-led NDA government.

""Minister, your government is more than five years old. The jobs that were there have been lost due to the economic recession brought by (your) government. Young people are looking to the government to show them something good... the way forward. But you want to escape by insulting the North Indians. It will not work,"" tweeted Priyanka in Hindi.

When Gangwar attempted to explain that his comments were in a ""different context"", were also ridiculed by former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati as hilarious.

""Rather than solving the problem of unemployment in the nation, particularly in the northern region, it is shameful that some of them have stated that there is a lack of qualification for which an apology should be issued to the nation,"" Mayawati also tweeted in Hindi.

Earlier this week Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman was criticised on Twitter for appearing to link the crisis in the auto industry, which has seen double-digit falls in sales and fired close to four lakh people to youngsters' preference for Uber and Ola cabs.

"'Double whammy': Congress attacks Modi govt on unemployment, US ending special trade status for India","The Congress on Saturday said the US government's decision to terminate special trade status for India will have adverse consequences on exports and urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take the country into confidence and make a comprehensive statement explaining how he intends to overcome this ""grave trade and economic crisis"".

Addressing a press conference, Congress chief spokesperson said it is a ""double whammy"" for India which has ""succumbed to US pressure"" of not buying crude oil from Iran and has also lost the special trade status and alleged that the government did ""nothing to preempt it"" despite being informed of the decision in March.

""On behalf of the people of India, we urge upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi to make a comprehensive statement on the issue to the nation and place before the public a way forward to overcome this grave trade and economic crisis,"" he told reporters.

""The Prime Minister should take the nation into confidence,"" he also said.

The Congress leader also urged the Modi government to withdraw the hike in LPG prices for both subsidised and non-subsidised category which it has ""gifted"" to the people soon after coming back to power.

The LPG prices have risen by Rs 323.5 per cylinder for non-subsidised category and Rs 85.37 for subsidised category in the last five years, the Congress said alleged.

""We urge the Prime Minster to take back this increase in LPG price rise,"" the spokesperson said, adding that women of the country will be badly affected by the price hike.

He said on one hand the Indian Government has decided to yield to pressure and stop purchasing crude oil of 23.5 million tonnes annually from Iran at favourable terms, on the other hand, 'special trade status' for India has been withdrawn by the country to whom its export volume is the largest.

""What is of more concern is the fact that the withdrawal of 'special trade status' was notified to India on March 4, 2019 itself. Yet the Government did nothing to preempt it. The most serious implication would be for sectors like Agriculture, Auto Parts, Pharmaceutical etc. which are already facing serious crisis,"" he said.

The Congress leader said in future, India could see many more industries, including the services industry which has more than UDS 28 billion under exports to the US being affected significantly.

He said a decline in exports to the the United States which is India's largest partner will worsen the job crisis.

""Already, unemployment is at a five-year high of 6.1 pc (NSSO) and GDP growth has slumped to a five year low at 5.8 pc. At this juncture, withdrawal of the special trade status by the US is a double whammy,"" he said.

He said the United States' proclamation terminating the status of India as 'beneficiary developing country' or 'special trade status' with effect from June 5, 2019 has grave trade and economic implications for India, as it directly effects India's exports worth USD 54.4 billion (Rs 3,80,000 crores).

The party spokesperson recalled that it is after 44 years that this status is being taken back, as it was on November 24, 1975 when Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister that this was granted to India. On the unemployment figures, the Congress leader said the NSSO data was earlier held back by the government but confirms that the job crisis in the country is grave.

""It cannot be subject matter of a slanging match between two political parties. India's young need jobs. India's young are unemployed. India's young are facing the worst unemployment crisis in last 45 years.

""So, bereft of the niceties, all these technicalities, the responsibility and the onus lies on the current Government to address the job crisis as its first priority,"" he said.

""We will request the Prime Minister to look at the job crisis as a priority number one for the nation and we will support any steps taken in this direction by the Prime Minister, for this positively and in a concrete fashion.

""We sincerely hope that a Prime Minister, who has been elected with such a huge mandate, is listening to the cry for justice of the young in this country,"" he said.

""In this country, nobody should be talking about unemployment as there is so much to be done in India. The problem is people look for a certain kind of job, when there are many other kinds of jobs around,"" he said at the sixth session of Youth and Truth series at IIM-B campus.

Sadhguru was replying to a query from students on unemployment in India.

PM Modi said he believed that Sadhgurus blessings would strengthen and further purify this sense of service.

""Swatch Bharat is not a movement by a certain government. This is not even the Prime Minister's Movement. This is the movement of Bharat, this is the movement of every citizen.

Between 2016, when demonetization was introduced, and 2018, 50 lakh citizens went jobless, although the report was quick to add that no direct causal relationship can be established based on these trends. Compared to the 2000-2011 decade, the report said, rate of unemployment has doubled in the country.

The 'State of Working India, 2019' report by the Centre for Sustainable Employment (CSE), was published on Tuesday, and comes at a time when the jobs crisis has become a major talking point and a key election issue.

Earlier this year, a media report had put out an unpublished periodic labour force survey report from the National Sample Survey Organisation, which showed that unemployment was at a 45-year high of more than 6 per cent in 2017-18. The government had officially denied the findings of the NSSO report, and called it a draft report.

An employment-unemployment module was added to this survey in 2016, the report stated.

The report noted that unemployment has been on the rise since 2011.

In the coming months, he says Monster will announce a series of tie-ups that will help his company to broadbase operations. The ‚Äúwar of words‚Äù on who‚Äôs bigger in the e-recruitment space will end as players will become more transparent with their numbers. And yes, the job market in 2011 is not hampered and this far it does not show any semblance of a 2008-09, when downsizing and curtailment of hiring was the norm. Modi, managing director of Monster India/South East Asia and Middle East, spoke to Lison Joseph and Satish John in aninterview. Excerpts:

Is the slowdown affecting hiring yet?Our employment index came out in July, so that hasn‚Äôt captured most of the events which have happened since. Our only reference point is our interaction with clients. We haven‚Äôt heard anything yet about a change in their plans, so hiring is going as planned. However, there is some caution creeping in. We would like to analyse that over the next 4-6 weeks once the dust settles down. So by September-end, we should be able to get a definitive view on the impact of the happenings in the US and Europe and on which sectors.

When did the crisis of 2008 hit India?Normally it takes about 3 months before showing up in hiring data here primarily because you can‚Äôt withdraw overnight the hiring mandates that are already in the market.

Besides reduced hiring, in what other forms can the impact be?Hiring will become more lateral than for freshers, because lateral hires can hit the ground running and add to business from day one unlike freshers who may need training. Another thing that happens is a relook at compensation. So it did not come down in absolute terms, it may even have gone up marginally but the mix changed ‚Äî between fixed base pay and variable pay. The thinking behind it was, why can‚Äôt we make employees a part and parcel of company‚Äôs performance. I think this may be the trend going forward, including this time.

In terms of moving to a higher variable component, how much more headroom do organisations have?Huge. As of now variable pay is more of a norm among top-level executives. But now we will see that moving down to other senior and mid levels and even among junior employees. How much variable pay depends on individual performance and how much on company performance will be a function of your seniority and the higher you move up a larger portion of the variable pay would be linked to company performance.

Where does MonsterIndia.com stand in relation to other e-recruitment sites such as Naukri ?We hold a leadership position among e-recruitment sites. Different sites use different metrics to decide who is the No. 1. But we go by the recent-resume count. We get about 14-15,000 new resumes every day and we have been leading on that metric for the last 4-5 years. It is far more than any of our competitors. Overall we have about 30 million registered users and about 26.6 million resumes in our database.

But there is a lot of confusion on who‚Äôs bigger‚Ä¶That‚Äôs because there is no credible financial dataon how big the market is. For example, InfoEdge, which is listed, gives ouit a total consolidated number. If you read the fineprint, anybody can get confused. There is no assessment on how big the online market is. Instead, there is a war of words. And that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve never used the word we are the No. 1. We have always maintained that we are one of the largest.

Isn‚Äôt it easy to put an end to this confusion by making public your numbers?Again it is a decision at the corporate level. In Europe, we don‚Äôt do that, though it happens to be the second-largest market,. We are there in 55 countries, so how do we do it? India is among our strategic markets.

How many clients do you have?Approximately 22,000. And that base has been growing at approximately 20-22% annually. That is also reflective of the growth in e-recruitment overall in India. Plus the phenomenon of e-recruitment has moved from metros to Tier-2 cities. So I am very bullish.

Recently professional networking website LinkedIn blocked Monster‚Äôs application. Does that affect your prospects at a time when the whole world is moving towards networking sites?We were surprised by LinkedIn‚Äôs decision. But we believe that the more open a network becomes, the more following it gets. However, we have launched an application for the Facebook platform called BeKnown and that has got a tremendous reception. Given the user base of Facebook, which is the largest social networking platform, I‚Äôm sure in times to come we will surpass LinkedIn‚Äôs overall user population.

Can you give us an idea of revenues accruing from India?Sorry. I cannot do that, because we are a listed company in the US and we come out with one number in a consolidated manner.

India continues to be a database market as against the US or Europe, which are more of a job-listings market. For instance, can job postings form a major chunk of your revenues in the coming years?It‚Äôs the Indian psyche. They don‚Äôt like to share or convey that they are looking for a change. The other thing is, if you are looking for a change aggressively you do not come under the quality bracket. If you are being chased by head hunters then you come under the quality bracket. But we see a lot of people open to putting up their database so that employers can give them a call. Things have been changing in the last 2-3 months.

Why is it that e-recruiters are not keen on catering to the blue collar?Globally, blue-collar workforce is a huge business for us. We will also be using mobile phone technology to reach out to them. With vocational training gaining traction around the country, we may see startling results in five years time.",https://www.dnaindia.com/business/interview-impact-of-crisis-on-jobs-to-be-clear-by-september-sanjay-modi-1579375,
'Why is there no social agitation?' Arun Jaitley cites 'peace period' to reject high unemployment claims,"Rejecting claims about high unemployment in India as ""disinformation"", Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Friday said there would have been social unrest in the country had there been no job creation as claimed by a ""leaked"" NSSO report.

Jaitley, who could not present the interim Budget as he is currently undergoing treatment in the US, said it would be ""economic absurdity"" to believe that jobs are not being created at a time when the country is witnessing high economic growth.

In an interview to ANI, he was asked about the ""leaked"" report of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) which claimed that there was unprecedented unemployment in the country.

""I don't think that is a report. That's a draft which has not been approved,"" he said.

#WATCH New York: Arun Jaitley reacts to media reports that National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) data was leaked which stated that unemployment was at a record high. pic.twitter.com/Hzm367PSGh ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) February 1, 2019

On Thursday, a media report based on the NSSO periodic labour force survey, said unemployment rate had hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18. However, the same day, the government said it had not finalised the survey on the labour force.

Jaitley, the Finance Minister since 2014 whose charge has been temporarily given to Piyush Goyal, said, ""Two misinformation have been given. The nominal growth adding the real GDP growth and inlfation is about 11.5%-12%. If the economy is growing by 12% nominal growth and if you compound it annually, the size itself is expanding very largely.""

""It would be an economic absurdity to say that such large nominal growth, the highest anywhere in the world, doesn't lead to the creation of jobs,"" he said.

""That can happen only in one eventuality that your productivity levels go up to such an extent that an even a bigger economy doesn't grow jobs,"" he added.

He said if there was such acute joblessness as projected, there would have been agitation, which is not the case.

""Also remember if no jobs creation takes place, there is social unrest. This has been a peace period as far as social issues are concerned and no major social agitation has been witnessed in the last 5 years.,"" the Union Minister said.

""I completely refute (claims about joblessness),"" he said, while terming the contention as ""disinformation"".

Govt's labour report cites major unemployment despite economic growth,"A labour report released by the labour bureau shows that while the economy is growing a 7%, jobs increased by 1.1% last year, which means that the government has been facing a growing employment crisis across the country.

As per reports in The Telegraph, statistics from the government's labour bureau show that job growth plummeted in key sectors to its lowest levels in eight years in calendar years 2015 and 2016 at 1.55 lakh and 2.31 lakh, respectively, compared with a high of over 10 lakh new jobs created in 2009.

According to the same report, one of the reasons behind the jobless growth is that companies are increasingly turning to automation and digital processes ""even as they pare other costs, including wage bills, to future-proof growth and profits in a competitive environment.""

The report, which gives data for eight sectors for nine months in 2016 till end-December - manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, hotels and restaurant, IT/BPO, education and health - shows low job growth in almost all sectors and jobs shrinking in construction and hotels and restaurants.

According to a Times of India article that cited the Labour Bureau report, Only 61% of people in the workforce were found to have year-round jobs with 34% working only 6-11 months even though they were willing to work for 12 months. ""The report also revealed that 68% households were earning only Rs 10,000 per month or less. In all, nearly 16 crore people in the workforce were under-employed in this manner,"" the article stated.",https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-govt-s-labour-report-cites-major-unemployment-despite-economic-growth-2444123,
India needs well-conceived strategy to become $5 trillion economy: Manmohan Singh,"Expressing concern over sluggish pace of growth in economy, increasing unemployment, poor investment, distressed farmers and crisis in banking sector, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh on Saturday stressed the need for adopting 'a well-conceived strategy' to be a five trillion US dollar economy and added that democracy is not 'inimical to development' but 'increases' growth.

Dr Singh, who was addressing the students of JK Laxmipat University, also vouched for the fact that institutions like the Supreme Court (SC), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), the Election Commission of India (ECI) and other such bodies are expected to work in an independent manner.

""Presently our country seems to have slowed down somewhat. The rate of GDP is declining. The investment rate is stagnant. Farmers are in distress. The banking system is facing a crisis, and unemployment is going up. We need a well-conceived national strategy to make India a 5 trillion economy,"" said Singh.

The former Prime Minister said that the need of the hour is to continue with the economic reforms that will build on liberalisation policies that have been implemented and factoring in a dynamic business environment.

""India since the economic liberalisation in 1991 has shown how a democratic set-up has led to a general improvement in the living standards of our people. Since then, millions of people have risen above the poverty line. There have been several policy measures undertaken by the successive governments that have led to more inclusive growth in India, particularly under MGNREGA and well-designed programmes of universal health care and education,"" he said.

""With more purchasing power in their hands, demand in the economy goes up encouraging private investment, more government revenues and taxes to fund infrastructure needs, good roads, railway and reduction in social conflict. Thus, it is clear that democracy does increase economic growth,"" said Singh.

""To strengthen, our democracy we need principle, knowledgeable and visionary leaders. It needs political parties committed to safeguarding values enshrined in our Constitution. For our continued unity, the government has to deliver justice, liberty, equality, and environment that respect the contrary opinion,"" he said.

Former Prime Minister Singh also said that we have to respect the supremacy of Parliament and its procedures, the rules of the government.

""Serving the federal structures like the Supreme Court, the Election Commission of India, the Controller and Auditor General of India, the CBI, Vigilance Commission, the Information Commission and various other commissions constituted by the government from time to time are expected to function independently within the framework of the Constitution,"" he said.

For long, major opposition parties including the Congress have been accusing the Central government of misusing institutions like the Election Commission and the CBI.

Talking about investments, Singh said private investment depends upon the credibility of government policies, ""which depend on the depth of the middle class and the rise of the middle class depends on the private investment.""

""To avoid virtual and vicious cycle requires a bit of luck, leadership, and team of people including industrialists who are prepared for the common good. In particular, the government should forbid tax terrorism, respect independent voices, and provide checks and balances at every level of the government,"" he said.

The former Prime Minister, himself a noted economist, said that some have argued that democracy is inimical to economic development and cited authoritarian regimes like China which have made phenomenal economic progress.

""It has been argued that although one-party has its drawback when it is led by an enlightened group of people it can also have great advantages. By persuading citizens to focus primarily on economic growth, these countries created an atmosphere of fear in which sacrificing personal freedom could be justified,"" he said.

""This allowed these regimes to impose politically difficult but critically important policies needed to move the economy forward. But over time as incomes grow, it changes the aspirations of people which ultimately strive for a democratic structure. In the long run, the functioning democracy has definite advantages over an authoritarian regime,"" Singh added.

He further said that today there is a stressful time for democracies across the world and for them Indian democracy is a beacon of hope and inspiration.

""It is a stressful time for democracies all over the world ... Democratic India is not only the world's largest democracy but also one of the most vibrant democracies in the world. It is perhaps India's greatest achievement ... Our shining democracy is a beacon of hope and inspiration to a world that is yearning and striving to become democratic,"" said Singh.

He underlined the strength of ""our democracy lies in the Constitution of India, which has framed and defined tenets of democracy as all-encompassing and reflective of fundamental values of equality, liberty, fraternity, secularism, and justice.""

The former Prime Minister stressed that population explosion, poverty, social inequality, and corruption, etc are challenges for the democracy in India.",https://www.dnaindia.com/business/report-india-needs-well-conceived-strategy-to-become-5-trillion-economy-manmohan-singh-2788209,
BJP MLAs create ruckus in Rajasthan Assembly over unemployment allowances,"BJP legislators Wednesday stormed the Well and later walked out of the Rajasthan Assembly alleging the unemployment allowances announced by the Congress government were a mere deception. Replying to a query during the Question Hour, Minister of State for Skill Development and Employment Ashok Chandna informed the House that 10.73 lakh educated unemployed youths are registered at the employment exchange in the state and the government has announced to provide up to Rs 3,500 as unemployment allowance to each of them under the Chief Minister Yuva Sambal Yojna.

He said the state government provided Rs 59.09 crore to 40,118 beneficiaries of the scheme between December 2018 and May 2019 and 29,019 youths have newly registered.

BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf in a supplementary question asked about the number of unemployed youths receiving the allowance after the Congress government came to power.

Leader of Opposition in the Assembly also joined him asking why the number of unemployed youths getting the allowance in Banswara, Udaipur and Dungarpur districts was less.

To this, Chandna said the issue needs to be probed as the figures were of the previous BJP government's tenure.

Anxious opposition stormed into the Well of the House and raised slogans.

India has 'full-blown job crisis' and our govt is in denial: Rahul Gandhi at London School of Economics,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi today said that the there was a ‚Äòfull-blown job crisis‚Äô in India.

He made the statement during an interaction with the students at the London School of Economics where he also said that the Indian government was in denial of the ‚Äòjob crisis.‚Äô

‚ÄòWhere China creates 50,000 jobs a day, only 450 jobs are created in a day. This is a catastrophe,‚Äô the Congress chief said.

Taking a dig at the Narendra Modi government, Gandhi said that ‚Äòthe jobs crisis can be addressed, but India has to first accept that there is a problem.‚Äô

Talking about the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi said that, ‚Äònext election is pretty straightforward. On one side there is BJP and on the other side, there is every opposition party. The reason is, for the first time, Indian institutions are under attack.‚Äô

Gandhi, who is on a 2-day tour to the United Kingdom, is also scheduled to address Indian Diaspora later.

Earlier in the day, addressing an event at the International Institute of Social Science (IISS), London, Gandhi brought back the Doklam issue to attack the Modi government and said that ‚Äòthe truth is Chinese are still in Doklam.‚Äô He also said that he would have handled the situation in a different way.

However, what sparked a massive row back home was Gandhi‚Äôs comparison between the RSS and the Muslim Brotherhood.

Launching a stinging attack against the Congress chief, the BJP today accused Gandhi of acting as a ""contract killer of the idea called India"" for his attempt to present them as a terror organisation.

BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said likes of President Ram Nath Kovind, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee, who died last week, have a Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) background and Gandhi's comparison of the organisation with an Islamist outfit at an event in London is ""unforgivable"".",https://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-india-has-full-blown-job-crisis-and-our-govt-is-in-denial-rahul-gandhi-at-london-school-of-economics-2654283,

Gandhi also spoke about the assassinators of his grandmother, former PM Indira Gandhi, who he said taught him how to play badminton.

He said, ""When my grandmother died, my father was in Bengal. My mom was strict and more disciplined and I was closer to my grandmother.

Rahul Gandhi uses Gadkari's 'Where are the jobs' remark to bash Modi govt,"Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Monday morning attacked the Centre over the lack of jobs.

He was taking a dig at Road and Transport minister Nitin Gadkari, who had on Sunday said that reservation will not guarantee employment as jobs were shrinking.

‚Äú""Let's us assume the reservation is given. But there are no jobs. Because in banks, the jobs have shrunk because of IT. The government recruitment is frozen. Where are the jobs?‚Äù Gadkari had said.

In response, the Congress president shared the report, which was written by PTI, saying, ‚ÄúExcellent question, Gadkari ji. Every Indian is asking the same question. #WhereAreTheJobs?

Earlire, Gadkari while addressing the quota system said, ‚ÄúThe problem with the quota is that backwardness is becoming a political interest. Everyone says I am backward. In Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, Brahmins are strong. They dominate politics. (And) They say they are backward,"" the senior BJP leader said.

""So one school of thought is that a poor is a poor, he has no caste, creed or language. Whatever may be the religion -- the Muslim, the Hindu or the Maratha (a caste), in all communities there is one section which has no clothes to wear, no food to eat.

""One school of thought also is (that) we must also consider the poorest of the poor section in every community,"" he said.

This is a ""socio-economic thinking"" and it must not be politicised, the Union Minister said.

Maintaining that Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis was trying to resolve the Maratha quota demand by holding talks, Gadkari urged people to maintain peace.

""The responsible political parties must not add fuel to the fire,"" he added.

The development, the industrialisation and the good prices for rural produce would ease the economic distress that the Maratha community is suffering from, he said.

Employment problem!,"Jug Suraiya

Jug Suraiya

The Prime Minister and his PA, Principal Adviser, are studying their ‚Äòto-do‚Äô list for the day.

PM: So, what‚Äôs on the agenda today? Which problem needs to be tackled on a priority basis? Is it Pakistan? Pakistan is always a problem. Specially, after they lost out to us in the World Cup. That‚Äôs the one good thing about it. You can always depend upon it to be a problem. Or is the problem that Trump fellow? Is he threatening to impose further import duties against us unless we stop buying Iranian oil?

PA: Those are problems. But there‚Äôs a bigger problem than those we have to deal with. The problem of employment.

PM: You mean the problem of unemployment. I know, I know. They're saying employment ‚Äî particularly among young people ‚Äî has reached an all-time high, and we've got to do something about it.

PA: Unemployment is a major problem which we have to do something about. But I was talking about an equally problematic problem, which is the problem of employment.

PM: How can employment be a problem? Doesn‚Äôt employment mean that you‚Äôve got a job? And if you have a job, what's your problem?

PA: The employment problem crops up when people have a job but no work to do. In other words, a naam ke vaste job, which really isn't a job at all.

PM: So, who are these unfortunates who have what you call a naam ke vaste job, which isn‚Äôt really a job at all because they have no real work to do, and who are creating this employment problem?

PA: Collectively, they‚Äôre known, or rather, were known as the Opposition. Ever since we won the last election with a whopping majority, the Opposition ‚Äî what there is left of it ‚Äî does technically exist but it has no real work to do. So, its job has become a naam ke vaste job and that's what's causing the employment problem.

PM: I see what you mean. Thanks to our whopping majority we can do pretty much what we like and the Opposition ‚Äî though it has a naam ke vaste job on a piece of paper called the Constitution ‚Äî doesn't have any real work to do.

PA: That's just it. All these Oppositionwalas though they keep making a bit of a halla-gulla now and again, have basically been made idle. And you know what they say about idle minds being the devil's workshop.

PM: So, you're saying they should be given some work to do? Fine. I'm all for it. But what sort of work should they be given? What sort of work can they do?

PA: Well, that's the crux of the problem. The only work they can do is to oppose, which is why they‚Äôre called the Opposition. But because of our whopping majority, opposing has become only a naam ke vaste job, a form of employment which doesn‚Äôt involve any real work. That's the employment problem.

PM: So, how do we find a solution to this employment problem?

PA: Don't worry. I‚Äôve already found the perfect solution?

PM: Really? What is it?

PA: Simple. We get the Opposition to oppose not us but to oppose itself. Which is exactly what they did and which got us our whopping majority.

PM: Let the Opposition oppose itself? What a brilliant idea. How did you think of it?

PA: Simple again. It's based on the principle of divide and misrule‚Ä¶",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/column/employment-problem-791804,

A senior officer said the Administration was likely to follow the Punjab Civil Service Rules and Conditions and the final decision would be taken by the UT Administrator at the earliest. The Punjab Government recently reduced the retirement age of its employees from 60 to 58 years.

After getting a legal opinion, the Administration had recommended the implementation of the Punjab service rules in the UT, said the officer.

EVEN as the Finance Minister unveils a series of measures to battle the economic slowdown, it is clear that one sector is being left out of the largesse. And that is the rural economy. It is here that the largest amount of pain is being felt due to slower growth. In Maharashtra, where the new political scenario is taking weeks to firm up, governance has been the loser, especially the agricultural sector, which needs support after disastrous floods in the kharif season. In state after state, farmers are in dire straits, not

to mention the landless labour force. It is in these segments of the economy that the government needs to provide succour. Such support, in turn, will push up demand in the rural economy and boost consumption at the bottom of the pyramid, where it will have the biggest impact.

One of the biggest ways in which support can be given is by stepping up the allocation for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) programme. The outlay for the current fiscal has been frozen at Rs 60,000 crore, the same level as in the previous year. This needs to be doubled to meet the needs of those who are increasingly looking for basic employment in the current economic downturn. As it is, the latest data shows that over 80 per cent of the outlay has already been utilised, clearly indicating the rising demand for employment in rural areas. The Rural Development Ministry is reported to have sought an additional Rs 20,000 crore in supplementary demands to continue the programme for the rest of the year.

The significance of MGNREGA is that it provides 100 days of employment to workers in the rural areas to build productive assets linked to agriculture. In drought-hit areas, this has been increased by 50 days. But what is worrying is that the average wage under the programme has been declining, compared to market wages over the years. The MGNREGA wages have been linked in the past to the consumer price index for farm labour, which has not been revised for several decades. The index is now proposed to be updated in a bid to increase the wages under the scheme. However, the government needs to make a take larger leap in terms of wages if it is

to provide the desired stimulus to the rural economy.

It must be recalled that MGNREGA was severely criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party before it came to power in 2014. It was viewed as a scheme that focussed on poverty but was not considered a solution to poverty. Subsequently, however, the NDA adopted the scheme and even expanded it. In fact, the allocations under the programme virtually doubled in the first tenure of the Modi government, from roughly Rs 33,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore

currently. The increased outlay went along with efforts to ensure that the scheme was made more efficient by creating productive assets in agriculture and allied sectors. The next step was to provide skilling to those working under the programme, but this is likely to take some time.

But the scheme was always considered the flagship of the UPA government. Ironically, now with increasing numbers turning to this anti-poverty scheme, the NDA government clearly has no option but to expand it sufficiently to meet the needs of the jobless due to the slowdown. The expansion has to be not only in terms of increasing numbers but also in ensuring that reasonable wages are paid to the workers. In some states, apparently, wages under the scheme have fallen below the stipulated minimum wages. The government must not have a

half-hearted approach to the programme and needs to increase wages to realistic levels. Besides, it will put more money in the hands of the weakest segments of society and, ultimately, provide the much-needed push to consumption.

Apart from this scheme, which many view as merely palliative, there is a need to bring about larger structural reforms in the agriculture sector. A much bigger focus needs to be put on the rural economy right now when farmers are facing distress due to stagnant farm prices and crop failures either due to drought or floods. There was a time when India worried about whether it would be able to produce enough to feed its large population. That problem has been resolved with overflowing granaries in recent years. The farmer is now finding it difficult to get remunerative returns on his investment. Hence, the protests with farmers throwing milk and vegetables in the streets, symbolises the stress faced due to lack of buyers.

It is high time the farm sector is made a priority in this country. It provides employment to about half the country‚Äôs workforce, but its share in the total GDP has shrunk to only about 15 per cent. The state of Indian agriculture is well exemplified by the state of Punjab. Held up as a success for being the granary of the nation along with Haryana, it has provided the maximum wheat and rice stocks to the Central inventories. But the state has high unemployment, rampant drug addiction and sizable numbers of youth looking to migrate abroad for better opportunities. It‚Äôs a unique paradox, which the state is now struggling to overcome. Other states also have serious problems in the agriculture sector, though they may be different, like being drought or flood-prone.

But the undeniable fact is that marketing systems remain archaic and agro-processing has not been made a priority. The need to ensure that farm debt is restructured has not been given enough attention while loan waivers are dismissed as populism. Similarly, farmer suicides are downplayed and, worse, these are linked to relatively small loans. For corporates, enormous amounts are merely converted into NPAs without thinking twice.

The bottomline is that the rural economy is in distress and the government needs to become its saviour. In doing so, it could also kickstart a cycle of faster growth and pull the economy out of its current slough.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/comment/boost-job-scheme-to-save-rural-economy-867042,
SCD College guest faculty presses for regular employment,"Tribune News Service

The guest lecturers of Satish Chandra Dhawan (SCD) Government College went on a mass leave today to stage a protest against the state government. All 63 lecturers of the college shouted slogans against the government during the protest.

65% students lack employment skills: Survey,"editorial@tribune.com

Ludhiana, September 5

On the occasion of Teacher‚Äôs Day, the teaching community has collectively voiced their opinion on the employability quotient of the Indian students and gave critical recommendations for the formulation of the New Education Policy to enable Education for Employment, through the Pearson Voice of Teacher Survey-2015. In Punjab, teachers feel that 65 per cent students do not possess skills required for employment.

The survey carries significant insights and possible solutions from teachers that can aid the government‚Äôs deliberations on themes such as employability, industry collaborations in the framework for the New Education Policy.

The Pearson Voice of Teacher Survey-2015 was conducted across the country in July-August 2015. In Punjab, it covered 27 cities, including Abohar, Amritsar, Anandpur Sahib, Bhatinda, Fatehgarh, Ferozepur, Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Mohali, Pathankot, Patiala, etc.

National findings show that with teachers considering 57 per cent of the Indian students to be educated but not adequately prepared for employment, the survey respondents strongly called for increased industry academia collaboration, particularly for course restructuring (75%), to help boost employability. Interestingly, the teaching community (44%) expressed the need for industry training of teachers in addition to merit-based industry internships (48%) for students.

Announcing the survey, Deepak Mehrotra, managing director, Pearson India, said, ‚ÄúBeing the world‚Äôs largest learning organisation, Pearson has taken an initiative to engage with the teachers to bring-out the topical issues facing Indian education sector and suggest measures to transform the learning landscape in the country. We are glad that the platform is gaining relevance among the teaching community and this is evident from the growing participation of teachers every year.‚Äù",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/65-students-lack-employment-skills-survey-129304,
Acid attack survivor in dire need of employment,"Tribune News Service

Jalandhar, January 16

Having moved from Kapurthala to Tanda Churian village of Hoshiarpur owing to her marriage two years ago, acid attack victim Neeta (33) lost her job as a volunteer in a government elementary school. Now having a year-old daughter, she says she is in a dire need of a job to raise her family.

Neeta, who recently was invited to Zirakpur to watch the movie ‚ÄòChhapaak‚Äô, said she raised her demand with the authorities and social workers who were there after the show, but returned without any assurance.

Neeta, who has served as a volunteer teacher in government schools of Kapurthala for eight years, said, ‚ÄúMy husband Sukhjit Singh is a daily wager. The Rs 8,000 monthly pension that the state government gives me incomes erratically. I have not got the pension for the last four months. Since my mother-in-law is there to look after my child if I go to work, I had applied for some private jobs, but could not get a chance anywhere. I even met the administrative officers seeking help in getting a job as a volunteer in government schools of area around Mukerian where I now live, but to no avail‚Äù.

An Arts graduate, she says, ‚ÄúI was a volunteer educator for disabled children at government school in Sheikhupur in Kapurthala and was later moved to school at Top Khana area.

Punjab does away with optional extension policy for employees,"Tribune News Service

Chandigarh, March 2

In line with the Budget announcement to revert to the earlier retirement age for employees, the Punjab Government has decided to do away with the policy of optional extension in service period after retirement/superannuation, in order to generate employment for the state‚Äôs youth.

The Punjab Cabinet, led by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh, on Monday approved amendment to the Punjab Civil Services Rules to make the necessary policy change, in accordance with the announcement made by the Finance Minister during his Budget Speech on February 28.

During the cabinet meeting, the Chief Minister also asked the ministers to take steps to identify the corrupt employees and deadwood, and weed them out of their respective departments, in a bid to improve efficacy and transparency in functioning.

The implementation of the decision to lower the retirement age necessitated the amendment to the relevant Rule 3.26(a) of Punjab Civil Services Rules, Volume 1, Part 1, according to an official spokesperson.

With this decision, employees who are currently on second year of optional extension, ie, who have attained the age of 59 or 61, as the case may be, and are availing the second year of optional extension in service, or whose second year optional extension is scheduled to start from April 1, 2020, will stand retired from the service with effect from March 31, 2020.

Similarly, employees on first year of optional extension in service, ie, who have attained the age of 58 or 60, as the case may be, and are availing the first year of optional extension in service, or whose first-year optional extension is scheduled to start in the interregnum period, shall stand retired from the service with effect from September 30, 2020.

The state government had earlier allowed extension in service to all categories of employees, up to the age of 60 or 62 years, on submission of option in this regard, as per the (amended) Rule 3.26. This had enabled the government to make recruitment to fill up the large number of vacancies in government posts and tackle the shortage of staff in various departments. However, with the staff shortage now effectively managed, this ground for optional extension can no longer be justified, the Cabinet felt.

Further, the extension in service had also led to the promotion chances of the feeder categories of employees being adversely impacted, triggering resentment among the employees. This was another reason for the decision to do away with the optional extension policy, said the spokesperson.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/punjab-does-away-with-optional-extension-policy-for-employees-49821,

The Haryana Government has issued guidelines for every department to follow in respect of re-employment after the age of 58 years.

An official spokesman said that the services of some categories or classes of officials would be allowed beyond the age of retirement for a maximum period of two years only for departments involved in maintaining law and order, regulatory work, work of administrative importance, infrastructure development and public utilities.

He said the administrative department would identify classes or categories of officials whose services were essential for efficient delivery of aims and objects of the organisation. The promotional avenues of junior or other officials should not be adversely affected. Extension would be proposed only if eligible candidate is not available for the promotion post from the feeder cadre for at least two years. A good service record would be non-negotiable. A majority of ACRs of the officials should be good or above and there should be no pending disciplinary action, he added.

The spokesman said that this would not apply in case of those employees whose term of re-employment after the approval of the Council of Ministers is still continuing till the expiry of their current re-employment. In case of doctors working in the Health Department or ESI Department, the age of retirement and period of re-employment would be as per the provisions contained in the gazette notification of November 21, 2016.

Heartfelt tributes were paid to the martyr who sacrificed his life for the motherland. While a march in favour of the Act, which promises employment to all unemployed youth in the country, was also taken out. It started from the Desh Bhagat Yadgaar Hall and passed through all prominent chowks and markets. A large number of students participated in the march and they raised slogans, praising the legendary revolutionary and criticised the state government for ignoring demands of the youth.

Addressing the gathering, the AISF state president Sukhdev Singh Dharmwala said: ‚ÄúThe youth of the state and the country are facing extreme problem of unemployment. Youngsters in a large number are unemployed in the state and such a situation is giving open chance to private and corporate sector for exploitation of labour.

In the ongoing probe into the loot of 30-kg gold from the branch of India Infoline Finance Limited‚Äôs (IIFL), Gill Road, the Ludhiana Police Commissioner (CP) Rakesh Agrawal categorically stated that the role of company employees was very much under scanner.

‚ÄúThe police will not give any clean chit to employees of the IIFL till the time their role is not scanned completely. Questioning of employees is going on.‚Äù the CP said.

‚ÄúThe poor security system and no guard on the IFFL office premises is what bring the firm‚Äôs role under lens,‚Äù the CP added.

Even in the of 35-kg gold loot from the IIFL branch in Gujarat on January 9, 2020, similar shortcomings in the security system were noticed, the CP said. Had company officials taken the Gujarat-loot case seriously, they would have improved the security system, but not one bothered, the top cop quipped.

Sources said the police have also been scanning the call details of company employees to find if any of them connived with robbers or not. ‚ÄúThe police have even taken dump of working phones at the time of robbery to get clue about suspects,‚Äù the sources added.

Let‚Äôs be more inclusive and welcoming,"Ekta Bhyan

In the year gone by, many experiences were felt and lived, some lessons were learnt. Shaped by all that and more, the new ‚Äòme‚Äô welcome the New Year with fresh hopes and goals. Following a golden triumph at the Asian Para Games, I had stepped into 2019 to achieve new heights for myself and the country. I participated in Grand Prix, Paris, 2019, and qualified to represent India in the Club Throw event at the World Para Athletics Championship, Dubai. I performed well, and the berth was booked for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympics. Now, another journey begins, and I hope it will culminate in a golden triumph in Tokyo. Every single breath in 2020 will be committed to turning this dream into reality.

In the year gone by, I got the opportunity to interact with many persons with disability (PID). Based on those interactions and other experiences, I feel this section of society lags behind in the two most crucial aspects of life ‚Äî education and employment. Most of them find it difficult to study beyond Class XII and hence employment opportunities are very scarce. As a result, they are totally dependent on their families, both financially and physically. One change I wish to see this year is a huge increase in the enrolment of persons with disability in the subjects of their interest in higher education, up to the doctorate level. They should be seen occupying high posts in both public and private sectors. For inspiration, we have the examples of Ira Singhal and Pranjal Patil ‚Äî these two diferently abled women have cracked civil services exam and became IAS officers in recent times.

There are low expectations from the differently abled when it comes to doing well in their career or achieving other goals. Any job, even if it doesn‚Äôt correspond with their qualification and calibre, is considered good enough for them. Even in today's world, wherein the Internet is accessible to everyone, people are unaware that even a 100 per cent disabled person can get a job and be financially independent. Unfortunately, the perception is, ‚Äúinko kaun naukri dega, kya karenge padh ke‚Äù (Who will offer them jobs, what's the point in educating them). In such a scenario, family support plays a vital role in the life of a differently abled child. A supportive family and the decisions taken by it could create a brilliant future for the child.

An inclusive society will be developed with the participation of the differently abled in different spheres of life. For that, there must be amenities like accessible transport, availability of assistive devices at reasonable prices and complete implementation of the RPWD Act, 2016. Every public place needs to be made accessible to them, right from malls, parks, theatres, restaurants, offices, etc. How often do we see a person on wheelchair in theatres? Or malls? Once, my disabled friend was asked by a stranger in theatre, ‚ÄúAapko yahan aane ki kya zaroorat thi.‚Äù Such is the mindset. A lot of money is spent on lifts but one needs to climb stairs to reach the lift. What is the use of lifts when one can't get in?

Besides, the infrastructure for the differently-abled should not be limited to schools, colleges, hospitals, offices, etc. Recreational places shoud have it too. Imagine how great a kid would feel in a park or the game zones in malls? Each one of us goes out for dinner, movies and party. Do we ever request the authorities to make it accessible for the differently abled too? The answer, of course, is 'no' because it doesn't matter until we or our loved ones find it challenging to access these places. The infrastructure for the disabled can be accessed by the able-bodied (ramps can be used by all) but the opposite is not true.

These experiences and problems are common to all people with disability. No one is disabled, the perception and inaccessible environment make them feel so. A little change in mindsets, in the environment around us, can bring a miraculous change in the lives of millions of people who have locked themselves up in four walls. I wish equal opportunities and participation for every citizen of the country so that they make full use of their potential and contribute to the nation's development.

Peace and happiness to all in 2020.

"Contractual employees block highway, demand regular jobs","editorial@tribune.com

Tribune News Service

Bathinda, October 10

Members of the Theka Mulazam Sangharsh Morcha on Thursday staged a protest and took out a protest march in the city. They were demanding the regularisation of jobs.

They said instead of regularising their services, the state government had started retrenchment of contractual employees in different government departments. The protesters also blocked the Bathinda-Mansa highway near the Hanuman chowk.

The protesters raised slogans against Finance Minister Manpreet Badal and the state government for allegedly failing to deliver on their promises. The union members said despite rendering services in government departments over the years, the services of contractual employees had not been regularised by the government till now. A minor scuffle also took place between the protesters and the police during the road blockade.

Contractual employees from various departments, including Education, Water Supply, Powercom, MGNREGA, Transport, Health, PWD and district administration, among others, participated in the protest. Later, a memorandum of demands was submitted to tehsildar Sukhvir Singh Brar before ending the protest.

Meanwhile, as the protesters had blocked the highway, traffic snarls were seen on the roads leading to the venue. Traffic policemen were seen making a failed bid to streamline traffic, though diversion of traffic from other routes by traffic personnel helped control things to some extent.

The protesters demanded that the government must stop privatisation of departments and start recruiting employees on a permanent basis and provide them all benefits which were being given to a regular government employee.

Moreover, employees from government departments must be reinstated at the earliest, they added.

Jagroop Singh, state convener of the union, said, ‚ÄúFollowing protests by union members, the state government had introduced the Punjab Ad hoc, Contractual, Daily Wage, Temporary, Work Charged and Outsourced Employees‚Äô Welfare Act, 2016. But the state government did not implement the Act. If the government had implemented it, the services of outsourced and contractual employees would have been regularised with all benefits. Instead of implementing the Act, the government has started the privatisation of various departments.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf our demand of regularisation was not fulfilled, we would be left with no alternative but to intensify our stir in the coming days,‚Äù added Singh. The protesters alleged that the ‚Äúanti-employee‚Äù policies of the state government would not be tolerated anymore now.

‚ÄúOn the one hand, the government is organising employment fairs to provide jobs to candidates in private firms, but on the other it is taking away jobs from government employees. We vehemently criticise this indifferent attitude adopted by the government. Salaries of government employees have been reduced in the garb of providing them regular jobs. Such steps are forcing us to hold protests,‚Äù he said.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/bathinda/contractual-employees-block-highway-demand-regular-jobs-845629,

Panchkula, September 30

Employment is the primary concern for Panchkula‚Äôs young voters, who play a crucial role in the forthcoming Assembly elections.

Some voters said everything came after a better career as they demanded politicians to focus on their issues, while others said they would either not vote or would press the NOTA (none of the above) button.

A few youngsters were found to be unhappy with the recent HSSC clerk exam held in various parts of the state. With the assembly elections scheduled to be held on October 21, The Tribune spoke to youngsters to know their issues on the basis of which they will vote.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay that electricity, water supply and roads have been improved, but where are the jobs?‚Äù asked Ashish Punia (21), a second-year BA (English) student at Government PG College, Sector 1. He said he could not appear for the HSSC exam as his centre was in Narnaul.

Sher Bahadur, a student of the said college, seconded his thoughts. But the 21-year-old, who will vote for the first time in the state assembly elections, considered high rate of population growth as the reason for less number of jobs. There are millions of people in the country, but jobs are very less, he said while emphasising on proper utilisation of resources. For him, inflation is also a concern.

Abhishek Kaushik, who spoke on issues ranging from Kashmir to the role of the media in current times, said what worried him the most was lack of transparency in government/competitive exams. There are 2,08,230 voters in Panchkula constituency as per current electoral figures which will be updated soon. As many as 4,575 falls in the category of 18-19 age group (most of them are considered as first-time voters). While 38,550 voters are between the age group of 20-29 years, 50,000 are in the age group of 30-39 years.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/employment-key-concern-for-young-voters-in-panchkula-840756,

During the mega employment fairs in September, Hoshiarpur has secured the second place in the state, achieving 36.74 per cent more than the projected target of providing employment. Deputy Commissioner (DC) Isha Kalia was honoured by the Director, Employment Generation and Training Department, for the feat.

The DC, while encouraging the District Employment and Business Bureau team, said a lot of hard work was done by the department to show right direction to the youth and frequent career counseling as well as placement camps were also held. As a result, more and more youth got employment opportunities in the district. She said career counseling, placement camps and employment fairs would continue.

Kalia said that in this series on November 21, an employment fair would be organised at SPN College, Mukerian, from 10 am to 4 pm. Even those who want to go for self-employment by taking loan can also take part in the fair.‚Äî OC",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/news-detail-863026,

India faces jobless growth,"editorial@tribune.com

Employers in India have benefitted more than the employees as labour productivity has grown faster than wages and employment generation has been slow over the past few years. Along with this caste and gender disparities have remained high in the work places.

These are the findings of 'State of Working India' (SWI) report by Azim Premji University that was released in New Delhi last week.

According to the report India has struggled to convert high rates of economic growth into good jobs, particularly for its educated youth.

Though wages in most sectors have grown steadily at around 3 per cent per year, 82 per cent of male and 92 per cent of female workers earn less than Rs10,000 a month.

The report proposes that the Union Government develop a National Employment Policy in close collaboration with the states. ‚Äî TNS

India Inc wakes up to employee engagement,"harinder@tribunemail.com

Swati Rai

Ask any HR Head about his biggest concern in the organisation, and without doubt it would be how to keep the employees engaged and ensure robust retention rate and involvement in company's growth. It would also be how do the CEO and the top management of the company set the benchmark of engagement excellence at work, so as not to face attrition or have disgruntled and disillusioned stakeholders in the company who can affect continuity and congruence of company's larger goals.

The question that now arises is who are these 'engaged employees' - well, they are those who are buoyant in the face of change, contribute maximum to the organisation's image as they are in sync with its aims. They are committed not only on ground, but also emotionally and mentally. Their allegiance and loyalty to the concern is not transitory and they give their best in low phases too.

At a time when millennials - a major focus of employee engagement - rule the roost in corporate what are some of the innovative efforts being employed by the companies to engage employees and how do these go beyond incentives and temporary sops offered? Employees thrive on collaborative and shared challenges, tapping into these, Chaitrali Singh, Director of Human Resources, India, ZS Associates shares, ""There is no greater motivation than when an employee's suggestions are heard and implemented to build a culture of constant innovation and engagement."" With this view in mind Quest, a yearly Innovation Challenge is organised that brings together employees from the company's different offices in India to work on real-world tactical business problems. For 24 hours at a stretch, the teams work together in a high-energy environment conducive to brainstorming and idea-generation. ""ZS invests time in teams with the best implementable solutions and provides mentorship to help gestate the ideas and deploy them in the company's work:, she adds.

Companies have realised that employee engagement is a matter of policy and not a one-off event that can bring about tangible and effective change. A Dale Carnegie survey, 2014 revealed the three key aspects that had the strongest effect on employee engagement. These included the relationship with immediate supervisor, belief in senior leadership and the pride in organisation. Tata Communications talks of creating a flexible and welcoming culture that engenders effective employee engagement throughout the year. With innovative policies like ""bring your kid to work day"" and company sports, they aim at involving the employees beyond their professional sphere. Promoting exceptional talent is another way of employee motivation. Aadesh Goyal, Global Head, Human Resources, Tata Communications shares, ""With employees with an average age of 35, we need to go beyond typical career track to promote opportunities for anyone to show their brilliance, entrepreneurship and impact on the business.""

For fostering innovation, the company launched a unique initiative - Moonwalk. It encourages employees to identify areas of interest, to learn about them through a creative process and to share the findings with everyone in the organisation.

A participative environment works wonders too. Fostering a culture that's open, transparent and shared, enables employees to mutually respect and trust each other. This is a time-tested tool of employee engagement. Entrepreneurship encouragement and nurturing innovations by the staff also is a case in point for developing employee loyalty and engaging them effectively. At PayPal the programme Incubator Startups@PayPal currently hosts 4 start-ups at their office.

Developing strengths of the employees and organising regular workshops and capability building sessions is another way that the companies adopt in inclusion, cohesiveness and collective development. 'Toast Masters Club at PayPal is an active forum that helps people improve their communication skills. ""We also provide guidelines for managers and employees to create part-time work schedules. They explore part-time solutions when requested by team members.'

Mutual understanding, a conducive to personal growth environment in addition to monetary incentives works wonders in engaging employees effectively. Umang Srivastava, Joint Managing Director, Bonita India shares, ""We have Employee Stock Option Scheme (ESOP), not just for the senior management but are offered not at all levels in the organisation"".

A Dale Carnegie survey indicated the fact that employee retention is a by-product of engagement levels. ""The average hike on current salary that an employee in India would find worthy of changing jobs is 20 per cent. The Survey revealed that 58 per cent of disengaged workers would accept another job offer as against only 14 per cent of fully engaged employees"". It is this commitment of engaged employees not to change companies is what organisational effectiveness in engaging is all about.",https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/archive/features/india-inc-wakes-up-to-employee-engagement-314689,

"India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 3-year high of 8.48% in October, says CMIE","The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy said on Saturday that India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 8.48% of the labour force in October. The rate of unemployment was 7.2% in September. The change is attributed to a slowdown in the Indian economy. This is the highest rate of unemployment since August 2016, The Hindu reported.

While urban unemployment stood at 8.89% in October, the figure for rural unemployment was 8.28%.

The Indian economy grew at just 5% in the April-June quarter, the slowest in six years. Besides, India‚Äôs industrial output declined by 1.1% in August, the worst performance in over six years. Infrastructure production fell to 5.2% in September.

In May, the government had released a report by the National Sample Survey Organisation that showed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18.

Mahesh Vyas, the managing director and chief executive officer of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, said the present unemployment rate is not comparable to rates before the demonetisation of high-value currency notes in November 2016, Business Standard reported. The 8.1% unemployment rate is graver than a same rate before the note ban, because of the shrinkage in the labour force.

‚ÄúThe high joblessness in the first half of 2016 was a different story altogether,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMany rural women and youth across the regions left the labour force itself after demonetisation, reducing the denominator that is used to calculate the unemployment rate.‚Äù

Urban unemployment rates have been higher by 1% to 2% as compared to rural rates. However, this difference fell to just 0.6% in October, Vyas said. ‚ÄúA rate of 8% in rural India is stressful, because there are not many fall-back options there, as in towns and cities,‚Äù Vyas said. ‚ÄúIt would become a question of survival if the situation worsens further.‚Äù

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37% in February from 5.97% in January, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65% from 9.70%, according to the data released by the Mumbai-based private think-tank.

This came after India‚Äôs economic growth slipped to a nearly seven-year low of 4.7% in the October-December quarter. The figures released by the government last week had made significant revisions to the estimates for the previous two quarters. For the July-September 2019 quarter, the economic growth was revised upwards to 5.1% from 4.5% estimated earlier. Similarly, the April-June growth was revised upwards to 5.6% from 5%.

Interview: ‚ÄòWe have underestimated the extent of India‚Äôs jobs crisis. It is far more serious‚Äô,"On Thursday, a political storm boiled over after Business Standard reported that, between 2017-‚Äô18, unemployment numbers in India reached a 45-year high. The newspaper based its report on a survey, conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation, called the Periodic Labour Force Survey that the government had not made public.

According to the report, the country‚Äôs unemployment rate climbed from 2.2% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 6.1% in 2018-‚Äô18. Once disaggregated, these numbers look even worse. Joblessness is higher in urban areas than rural areas ‚Äì 7.8% versus 5.3%. For instance, unemployment among rural men in the age group of 15-29 years rose from 5% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 17.4%.

The report corroborated what the government‚Äôs critics have been saying ‚Äì that demonetisation and the ham-handed rollout of the Goods and Services Tax have resulted in large job losses. In a press conference called on Thursday evening, the government hit back. It claimed other datasets ‚Äì like that of Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation ‚Äì show employment in the economy is rising. At the event, Amitabh Kant, the chief executive officer of Niti Aayog, also suggested results of the Periodic Labour Force Survey, based on a new methodology which conducts quarterly surveys, is not comparable with older NSSO surveys.

Do these various reasons offered as defence hold up to scrutiny? Scroll.in asked Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University.

Excerpts from an interview.

The government and its supporters claim EPFO data challenges the Business Standard report. Is that a fair comparison?

No. [Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation] data tells us about formalisation of the economy. It doesn‚Äôt measure job creation. As such, it tells us how 15% of the economy, which is formal, is doing. But it doesn‚Äôt say anything about the informal sector, which is about 85% of the economy. In that sense, it is not a full measure of employment. And the informal economy is where jobs are being lost. Only the [ National Sample Survey Organisation] can tell us how the informal economy is doing.

Some background, please. These reports were delayed. What happened there?

Two surveys, on consumption-expenditure and employment-unemployment, are carried out usually at the same time after every five years but occasionally in-between. The NDA [National Democratic Alliance] government has been apprehensive about both of these ‚Äì one used for poverty measurement and the other for employment. Maybe they felt the numbers would not be positive. And so, from 2015 onwards, they had begun making noises criticising NSSO surveys.

The survey should have been conducted in normal course in 2016-‚Äô17. But it did not. It was eventually carried out in 2017-‚Äô18. Its report should have come out last September but it did not. Now, as we see from the data, they were right to be apprehensive.

The new report is called Periodic Labour Force Survey. Some people say its numbers are not comparable to earlier NSSO surveys?

This is NSSO data. The difference between the two is how they report the data. The Periodic Labour Force Survey reports rural data on an annual basis and urban employment data on a quarterly and annual basis. While there is some difference in sampling in urban areas, the broad methodology is same and the two datasets are broadly comparable.

What do these numbers tell you?

First of all, there is nothing wrong with the data. It fits with what we have been saying about job losses after demonetisation. If anything, we have underestimated the extent of India‚Äôs jobs crisis. It is far more serious than we had imagined.

This is not just about low job creation but also about the worsening quality of jobs. An ad for 13 waiters gets thousands of applicants. All of these are not people applying for a job for the first time. Many are people dissatisfied with their current jobs. Both show as a huge demand for jobs as well as a huge premium for government jobs.

Both quantity and quality have to be seen together. There are no easy answers here. And there are no short-term answers certainly.

The Business Standard report also says that more people are withdrawing from the workforce ‚Äì labour force participation is coming down. What does that indicate?

It could be [for example, people] voluntarily moving to educational institutions [for higher studies instead of joining the job market] but the extent of decline is so large that it does not explain the large decline in labour force. The other explanation is ‚Äúdiscouraged worker‚Äù hypothesis, which is that workers withdraw from labour force if they do not see any hope of getting jobs.

This is 2017-‚Äô18 data. How do you think the informal economy has fared since the data got collected? Have things begun improving?

No. All available indicators suggest the situation of informal sector has only worsened, We are in the middle of a deep rural crisis. And a large part of the informal sector depends on rural demand.

India‚Äôs unemployment crisis is helping at least one company: LinkedIn,"LinkedIn‚Äôs reach in India has more than doubled in the last 20 months.

In August, 15% of Indian smartphones had the professional networking app installed, up from just 6% in January 2018, according to data from Delhi-based market intelligence firm Kalagato.

‚ÄúThis could be a result of two factors: First there is greater product adoption amongst the target audience and second, many users who were previously using the web version are now switching over to the app,‚Äù said Aman Kumar, Chief Business Officer at Kalagato. The company surveyed over 1.5 million Indian smartphones for this research.

Hidden opportunities

Multiple experts told Quartz that LinkedIn‚Äôs newfound fame can be attributed to one of India‚Äôs biggest crises: unemployment.

‚ÄúIn a tightening job market, there‚Äôs been high demand for finding any job, not just better jobs,‚Äù said independent tech-policy consultant Prasanto K Roy. ‚ÄúAn increasing number of people who are laid off or facing impending closure of divisions or products ‚Äì especially true of the media sector, but also of manufacturing, automobiles, and others ‚Äì are using LinkedIn. There‚Äôs also the network effect of all those users.‚Äù

Worldwide, the Microsoft-owned platform has more than 660 million members. Of these, 175 million are from the Asia Pacific region, and India accounts for 62 million.

And, the untapped market opportunity is still immense. ‚ÄúEven for sophisticated companies, typically 20% - 30% of their employee base isn‚Äôt available on LinkedIn,‚Äù said Yugal Joshi, vice-president at Texas-based consultancy Everest Group.

Obviously, LinkedIn has been going all out to woo Indian users.

Inviting India

Most notably, in August 2017, LinkedIn launched a data-saver version of its website and mobile app called LinkedIn Lite. The Made in India product has now been deployed across 60-plus emerging markets.

Moreover, stars from various industries such as Paytm founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Biocon‚Äôs Kiran Mazumdar Shaw are active on the site. The country‚Äôs prime minister Narendra Modi is a LinkedIn Influencer, as is Bollywood superstar Priyanka Chopra.

The California-based company has also been very aggressive in promoting LinkedIn Premium in India, but there‚Äôs scepticism around its success. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an expensive subscription and Indian job seekers may be put off by the commitment to a monthly subscription,‚Äù Roy, who previously worked with IT industry trade body NASSCOM, said. ‚ÄúSome even say the LinkedIn Premium tag makes them look desperate when connecting.‚Äù

Strong retention game

Despite the growing user base, only a small chunk of users come back to the LinkedIn app time and again. Less than 10% of LinkedIn‚Äôs users are monthly active users, Kalagato‚Äôs data show. By comparison, more than 60% of Facebook and Snapchat‚Äôs are.

But Kumar argues the low monthly active users rate is not a point of concern. ‚ÄúLinkedIn is a professional networking and jobs platform, therefore the use case is very different from other social networking platforms that are also a source of entertainment,‚Äù he explained.

What‚Äôs more important is that there is high product stickiness among users. Just look at the uninstall rate.

‚ÄúGenerally, users uninstall mobile applications due to reasons such as poor user experience, complex features on the application, lack of value, and so on,‚Äù TechSci‚Äôs Seth reasoned. ‚ÄúLinkedIn has managed to overcome such issues, as it offers a wide range of interactive features such as endorsements, connections, professional groups and job searches to its users. Additionally, it also has a simple and bug-free user interface.‚Äù

And unlike social media apps that are wrestling with each other for a user‚Äôs entertainment time, LinkedIn barely has any competition.

‚ÄúLinkedIn has successfully established itself as a professional network focussed on professional aspects,‚Äù said tech sector analyst Harish HV. ‚ÄúIt is actively promoting itself as a site that lists jobs and helps people find jobs. Content and AI are helping them localise and target users in India with specific inputs that are useful for working people.‚Äù

Moreover, it does not follow a standard, short photo-and-bio format like social networking sites. It‚Äôs a time-consuming process to sign up and create online resumes. For those already on the world‚Äôs largest professional networking site, there‚Äôs little incentive to sign up on smaller ones. And employers and jobseekers alike flock to where the masses already are.

The Modi Years: Did Indians find jobs or lose them?,"The Modi government‚Äôs term has been marked by a sharp debate on jobs

An official survey showed unemployment rose to the highest level in 40 years in 2017-‚Äô18

But the government refused to release the survey, citing other databases as evidence of job creation

Other independent surveys, however, back the claims of rising unemployment in India in the last five years

One of the main promises of the Bharatiya Janata Party in its 2014 manifesto was the creation of jobs. Holding the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government responsible for ‚Äúten years of jobless growth‚Äù, it promised to reverse the trend.

Five years later, the Narendra Modi government‚Äôs record on employment is mired in controversy as an official survey showed India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to its highest level in 40 years in 2017-‚Äô18. The government withheld the release of the survey, prompting two members of the National Statistical Commission to resign. After the survey‚Äôs findings were reported by the Business Standard in January 2019, officials of the Modi government‚Äôs think tank NITI Aayog first claimed it was not final, then sought to discredit it.

The Modi government has instead relied on other much smaller data sources, like the Employees Provident Fund and the MUDRA scheme which advances loans to small-scale entrepreneurs, to maintain it has improved the jobs situation.

Independent large-scale surveys, however, show a worsening picture. More than ten million jobs were lost between December 2017 and December 2018, a survey by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy found.

With much of the jobs debate focused on numbers, here is a look at the main methods used to measure jobs in the economy and what they reveal about the employment situation under the Modi government.

Household surveys

The most reliable method of estimating employment in a country like with a large informal sector is the household survey which collects data at homes and not at workplaces. It reflects employment levels in both the formal and informal economy. The National Sample Survey Office under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation as well as the privately-run Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy use this method.

Since the 1970s, the NSSO conducted a large-scale household survey called the Employment-Unemployment Survey every five years. The last survey done in 2011-‚Äô12 showed an unemployment rate of 2.2%.

To generate more timely data, since 2010, the Labour Bureau of the Ministry of Labour and Employment also conducted an annual household survey. In 2016-‚Äô17, it showed the unemployment rate had risen to a four-year high of 3.9%.

Since then, the Modi government discontinued the Labour Bureau‚Äôs household surveys and replaced the NSSO‚Äôs five-yearly exercise with an annual survey called the Periodic Labour Force Survey. The field work for the first round was done between June 2017 and June 2018.

In January 2019, after the government refused to release the survey, it was leaked to the Business Standard. It showed a surge in the unemployment rate to 6.1%, the highest in four decades, with increasing joblessness among all social groups, and educated youth reporting the highest levels of unemployment.

Data and visualisation by Nithya Subramanian

One measure which captured whether the person surveyed had found work that week revealed even higher unemployment level of 8.9%. This tallies with ground reports that had shown large-scale job losses among daily wage workers in the aftermath of the government‚Äôs decision to demonetise high-value currency notes in November 2016, followed by the botched-up implementation of the Goods and Services Tax in July 2017.

The government initially dismissed the reports, claiming the leaked survey was merely a draft. The chief executive officer of the NITI Aayog, Amitabh Kant, subsequently wrote a column in the Business Standard arguing the survey was not comparable to previous ones and criticised its sample size and methodology. In a rebuttal, PC Mohanan, who had resigned as the head of the National Statistical Commission in protest against the government‚Äôs refusal to release the data, said the survey was comparable and had not released simply because it ‚Äúpurportedly contradicted certain carefully cultivated narratives‚Äù.

Enterprise surveys

Another way to estimate employment trends in the economy is by collecting data at establishments, but this only reflects employment levels in the formal economy.

The Labour Bureau under the Ministry of Labour and Employment conducts Quarterly Quick Employment Surveys that measure employment in eight sectors of industry and services by surveying enterprises with more than 10 workers.

These surveys show the net jobs created in eight sectors of the Indian economy declined sharply from 10 lakh in 2011-‚Äô12 to just 4.16 lakh in 2016-17.

Data and visualisation by Nithya Subramanian

While reporting the data, a government press release pointed out the survey covered employment trends for only 2.4 crore workers against 47 crore workers in total workforce.

A government panel has recommended the quarterly surveys be discontinued due to poor quality and coverage.

Employee Provident Fund

The Modi government has argued a better way to estimate employment trends in the formal economy is by using the data of workers registered with the Employment Provident Fund Organisation, which helps workers save towards retirement, death and disability.

Data released by the EPFO showed it had added 73.5 lakh subscribers between September 2017 and November 2018. The government has cited this data as evidence of job creation.

But this is misleading since only firms with more than 20 employees are required to register with the EPFO. A rise in subscribers could simply reflect workers moving from the informal economy into formal jobs, as the Chief Statistician of India said.

Even workers who move between jobs could show up as new subscribers. Business Standard found of the 62 lakh new subscribers that EPFO added between September 2017 and July 2018, 15 lakh or 24% were those who had exited their EPF subscription from one job to rejoin later, with a new job.

MUDRA scheme

Facing criticism for rising unemployment, the main thrust of the government has been to argue that official statistics do not capture the jobs being created through entrepreneurship. Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointed to a pakoda seller as an example of that, in a TV interview in January 2018.

To back its claims, the government is planning to release a survey of beneficiaries of the Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency or MUDRA scheme which advances loans to small scale entrepreneurs, the Indian Express reported. The NITI Aayog has asked the Labour Ministry to conduct the survey in a manner that captures both jobs created directly and indirectly by the scheme.

Queries under the Right to Information by NDTV in February 2019 elicited no response on the number of jobs created through the MUDRA scheme.

Looking beyond the numbers

One proximate reason for the worsening job numbers, as field reports has exhaustively captured, is the economic upheaval caused by the government‚Äôs demonetisation decision, followed by the botched-up implementation of the Goods and Services Tax.

But the Modi government has dismissed this possibility, citing India‚Äôs rising Gross Domestic Product. ‚ÄúIs it possible to conceive that such high nominal growth despite controlled inflation will not lead to any job creation?‚Äù asked Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in February 2019.

While some have argued the jobs data itself calls into question the veracity of the GDP numbers, another possible answer might lie in the State of Working India report released by the Azim Premji University in 2018. The report found that India has struggled to convert high economic growth into jobs, with a 10% increase in the Gross Domestic Product resulting in less than 1% increase in employment.

It found wages had not kept pace with the rise in labour productivity, with 82% of male workers and 92% of female workers earning less than Rs 10,000 a month, and 90% of the industries in the organised sector paying less than the minimum wages.

A report released by the International Labour Organisation in 2018 estimated that 77% of employees in India will have vulnerable jobs by 2019, indicating poor quality of jobs.

To address some of these challenges, the Modi government said it would merge 44 existing labour laws into four labour codes on wages, social security, industrial relations and occupational safety, health and working conditions. One code was tabled in Parliament but could not be passed. The others were in draft stage.

The Daily Fix: Unemployment is India‚Äôs biggest crisis. Why isn‚Äôt it the focus of the Lok Sabha poll?,"The Modi government has delayed the release of the Labour Bureau‚Äôs survey on the number of jobs generated under the Micro Units Development & Refinance Agency (Mudra) scheme, The Indian Express reported on Thursday. It will only be made public after the Lok Sabha elections.

Mudra is one of the Modi government‚Äôs flagship schemes, geared to helping small businesses get credit. It is worrying that the government feels the need to hide the data about jobs created by this mega scheme.

This is part of a pattern: before this, the Modi government had sought to conceal two other reports on India‚Äôs employment numbers. The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs periodic Labour Force Survey Report for 2017-‚Äô18 was suppressed, as was the Labour Bureau‚Äôs sixth annual employment-unemployment survey.

The reason for this opacity is not hard to see: India is facing a major jobs crisis.

India would need to create 1.3 million jobs every month just to stay where it is and keep its employment rate constant.

The gargantuan size of that number is just the tip of the iceberg. Far from creating 1.3 million jobs every month, India is actually losing jobs. The average employment number for 2017 was 406.5 million. This fell to 402.1 million in 2018. As a result, India‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at a 45-year high in 2017-‚Äô18.

Moreover, there seems no light at the end of the tunnel. Investment in Indian industry is falling precipitously. According to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the value of new investment proposals fell from Rs 25 trillion in 2010-‚Äô11 to Rs 11 trillion in 2017-‚Äô18.

Given the size of the problem, India‚Äôs politicians should be working frantically to create new jobs. However, that does not seem to be happening. In fact, with measures like the new Goods and Services tax and demonetisation, Union government policy is actually causing job losses.

Unfortunately, the government has been attempting to deflect attention from the jobs crisis by trying to make emotive issues such as nationalism the focus of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Over the past few weeks, many ruling party politicians have latched onto the recent skirmishes with Pakistan and the conflict in Kashmir to avoid discussions about the fundamental issue of economic hardship.

In spite of this, in a survey conducted on March 7, ten days after India and Pakistan bombed each other, respondents said that unemployment was the most important electoral issue for them, far ahead of terrorism.

Elections for any democracy is a time for politicians to take stock and go to the people for guidance on the shape and direction of government policy. During the upcoming elections, politicians would do well to put the jobs crisis high on their agendas and find ways to fix it.

The key to solving India‚Äôs unemployment problem is to boost female entrepreneurship,"Female entrepreneurs may hold the key to alleviating India‚Äôs unemployment problem.

Enabling women to start up and scale can help employ up to 170 million people by 2030, according to a joint report by Bain & Company and Google. ‚ÄúThis will be 25% of the new jobs required for the entire working-age population,‚Äù said Megha Chawla, partner at Bain & Co and the lead author of the report.

Women currently own a mere 20% of all enterprises in India. However, these units directly employ 27 million people. ‚ÄúIf we focus on enabling more women entrepreneurs to start up and scale, we will be able to increase direct employment by 50 million to 60 million people, and increase indirect and induced employment of another 100 million to 110 million people [by 2030],‚Äù said Chawla.

Increased participation of women in entrepreneurship has other advantages, the report noted:

Social outcomes : Enabling female entrepreneurship benefits future generations through the multiplier effect, the report said. Citing the International Monetary Fund, it noted, ‚ÄúInvesting in women builds economic and social prosperity by enabling a gradual social shift from high fertility, low education and poor health to making more conscious reproductive choices, higher education and better health for self and family.‚Äù

Current state

India has between 13 million and 16 million micro-, small- and medium-scale enterprises and agribusinesses owned by women, the Bain & Company-Google report stated.

Notably, most of these women-owned ventures are single-person businesses, which translates to lower returns and employment. Only 17% of all woman-owned enterprises employ hired workers in comparison with 28% for all enterprises, the report said.

Rural, non-farm, home-based businesses form the largest share ‚Äì 38% ‚Äì of woman-led ventures in India. Urban, self-employed women who work from home constitute 31% of woman entrepreneurs, as per the report. ‚ÄúFarm-based business owners at 18% and small business owners at 14% employing less than 10 employees contribute most to employment generation,‚Äù the report said.

"Unemployment rose to 45-year high in 2017-‚Äô18, shows Centre‚Äôs ‚Äòburied‚Äô report: Business Standard","The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey recorded the unemployment rate in India at a 45-year-high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18, Business Standard reported on Thursday. This was the first full financial year after the government demonetised high-value currency notes in November 2016.

Two independent members of the National Statistical Commission had resigned this week after the government allegedly failed to publish the report that was prepared last month. The report is still not public.

The survey is the first on employment by a government agency since demonetisation. The Periodic Labour Force Survey is also the first annual household survey of the National Sample Survey Office. Its data was collected between July 2017 and June 2018.

Documents reviewed by the Business Standard showed that unemployment rate was at its highest since the 1972-‚Äô73 period, from when the employment data is comparable. In comparison, the unemployment rate stood at 2.2% in 2011-‚Äô12, during the United Progressive Alliance‚Äôs second term, according to the survey.

The report showed that the unemployment rate among the youth was at a higher level compared to previous years and ‚Äúmuch higher compared to that in the overall population‚Äù.

The rate of unemployment among men in rural areas between the ages of 15 and 29 years jumped to 17.4% in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 5% in 2011-‚Äô12. The unemployment rate among women in rural areas stood at 13.6% in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 4.8% in 2011-‚Äô12, according to the survey.

PM Narendra Modi

Unemployment among youth in urban areas was higher than in rural areas ‚Äì 18.7% for men and 27.2% for women in 2017-‚Äô18.

More among the educated were jobless in 2017-‚Äô18 than they were in 2004-‚Äô05. For educated women in rural areas, unemployment was at 17.3% in 2017-18 compared to 9.7%-15.2% during 2004-‚Äô05 to 2011-‚Äô12. For educated men in rural areas, the unemployment rose to 10.5% in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 3.5% to 4.4% during 2004-‚Äô05 to 2011-‚Äô12.

The labour force participation rate, which is the proportion of population working or seeking jobs, declined from 39.5% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 36.9% in 2017-‚Äô18. The labour force participation has been declining since 2004-‚Äô05. The dip was at a higher pace in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 2011-‚Äô12, but at a lower speed than what was witnessed in 2009-‚Äô10.

Present a roadmap for tackling rising prices, says Congress

The Congress demanded that the prime minister convene a meeting of all parties and present a roadmap to tackle inflation, PTI reported. Congress‚Äô chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of indulging in politics of hatred and division, and said he should focus on the country‚Äôs development instead.

‚ÄúWe demand that the prime minister should come forward and convene a meeting of all Opposition leaders and lay down a roadmap for tackling and bringing down prices of essential commodities in the next 30 days,‚Äù he said, adding that India‚Äôs nutrition and food value will both be under serious threat if this does not happen. ‚ÄúWe sincerely hope that prime minister, who came to power saying that he is going to attack inflation, is the same prime minister today who is on a ‚Äòmaun vrat‚Äô [vow of silence] on the unprecedented inflation that plagues the food budget of the common household.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn last nine months, inflation is going up rapidly every month but PM is silent...Where is the prime minister,‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúToday, onions are selling at Rs 85 a kg against Rs 8 a kg in 2014...but prime minister is missing in action.‚Äù

Surjewala questioned if Modi was even concerned about the millions of households that now have to cut down on their daily food budget. ‚ÄúIs he even concerned about millions of India‚Äôs daughters and women who have no money in their hand to cook every day‚Äôs meal and to provide adequate nutrition to the family,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIndia is on the cusp of an unprecedented food price inflation but the prime minister is absolutely silent.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn this entire atmosphere, the only magic wand that Modi ji has is division and hatred,‚Äù the Congress spokesperson alleged. ‚ÄúWhen any individual or an executive of a company, or a thinker or a writer, or journalist or a policy analyst ever makes a point that the CAA and NRC and NPR are inherently divisive and diversionary in order to draw attention away from rampant food inflation, from unprecedented joblessness,‚Äù Surjewala added. ‚ÄúSo, the only answer then is to declare such people anti-national or tell them not to do business in India. I think that is entirely myopic and a rudimentary approach bordering on being idiotic. We humbly, respectfully tell the prime minister to look within to introspect and to move beyond his agenda of division to agenda of development.‚Äù

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi accused the government of picking pockets of the common man and also taking away their livelihood.

Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram also attacked the Modi government. He said if unemployment rises and incomes decline, there is danger of youth and students ‚Äúexploding in anger‚Äù and asked whether this is the ‚Äúachhe din [good days]‚Äù promised by the ruling party.

The Indian economy recorded a growth rate of just 4.5% for the July-September 2019 quarter, the lowest in six years. The economy has been hit by weak consumption and thousands of job cuts.

This near-dejection has not caught hold of Deepak Maurya yet. Dressed in a white vest and shorts, the 17-year-old has just completed his Class 12 exams and taken a train to Allahabad, ‚Äútaiyyari ke liye‚Äù ‚Äì to prepare.

Maurya is staying with a relative in a room in one of the many lodges in the neighborhoods around the University of Allahabad. This particular lodge houses about 20 people in a handful of 8ft by 9ft rooms, all of them preparing for competitive exams for government jobs.

The test-preparation industry thrives in many parts of India, some of the most prominent in the North being Delhi; Allahabad, which attracts aspirants from eastern Uttar Pradesh; Jaipur and Jodhpur in Rajasthan; as well as smaller cities such as Sikar in the eponymous district in Rajasthan for those who cannot afford to go to big cities.

Localities such as Vivek Vihar in Jaipur, Katra and Baghada neighbourhoods of Allahabad, and Mukherji Nagar, Rajendra Nagar and Munirka in Delhi, contain concentrations of the educated unemployed ‚Äì those who constitute India‚Äôs historic demographic potential, vying for a shrinking pool of secure employment opportunities.

In near-identical neighbourhoods across these cities, thousands of youngsters spend some of their most productive years preparing for exams that may or may not get them government jobs. Former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, Raghuram Rajan, recently referred to 25 million youth applying for 90,000 low-grade jobs in the Indian Railways as evidence that high growth has not produced enough jobs.

In this first of a two-part series, we share the findings of a survey and our interviews with aspirants on how much time and money they spend, and the disadvantages that those from particular socio-economic backgrounds face.

The second part will focus on the meaning these competitors attach to a government job, how they view the work in the private sector and what they think needs to be done to improve India‚Äôs employment situation.

An intensifying crisis

Earlier this year, the government distanced itself from a leaked National Sample Survey Office report that said unemployment levels have reached a 45-year high. Leading political and administrative figures in the government ‚Äì the prime minister and the vice chairperson of the Niti Aayog included ‚Äì used Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation numbers as evidence of job creation instead. They were categorically criticised by experts for skirting the issue using misleading data.

Source: Compiled by the authors from reports from various sources including the BBC, India Today and Reuters.

Government jobs have always been highly sought-after for as long as they have existed in India. The distinction now is that highly qualified candidates (most of the applicants in the table above are reported to be graduates or above) are vying for petty positions in the government apparatus.

In an attempt to better understand India‚Äôs jobs crisis, we decided to focus on this group of young, educated people who spend years trying to secure a formal government job.

Figures such as those given in the table above suggest the numbers run into many millions. However, there is no official data source on this population group and little is known about the investments they make in pursuit of secure employment. To better understand the concerns of this group and what they can tell us about India‚Äôs employment fix, we conducted a small survey in the months of March and April across three cities, namely Delhi, Jaipur and Allahabad.

Two factors that contextualise our study are:

An intensifying problem of lack of job creation in the Indian economy: The leaked NSSO report that pegged the unemployment rate at 6.1% presents part of a longer trend in which high gross domestic product growth has not resulted in job creation. An important indicator, employment elasticity ‚Äì how many jobs are created relative to how the economy is growing ‚Äì has been as low as 0.01 in the high GDP years. Recent estimates from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy show the Labour Participation Rate as having fallen from 47% to 45% ‚Äì that is 13 million fewer people looking for jobs. A shrinking state sector: Between 1999 and 2011, the share of informal workers in the organised sector rose from 32% to 67%. The trend in government employment has been similar with a reduction in secure, formal employment. Permanent employment in the Central Public Services has reduced from 1.61 million to 1.13 million between 2006-‚Äô07 and 2016-‚Äô17, while the Indian Railways has seen an absolute decline of 90,000 in its permanent employee strength over the same period. India Post and public banks have seen an absolute reduction of 18,000 and 60,000 between 2012-13 and 2016-17.



Our sample of 515 respondents was unequally distributed across the three cities, with 317 in Delhi, 132 in Jaipur and 66 in Allahabad. We conducted qualitative interviews and group discussions that complemented the findings from our survey. The findings are not to be considered as representative, but they do provide interesting insights especially when compared across cities.

How long does it take?

The older the age group, the longer it takes for aspirants to clear their exams, our analysis of responses shows.

From an average of two years and 10 months reported by those under 20, there is a steady increase to three years and seven months for those above 28 years of age. This trend was particularly sharp in Allahabad (see figure below), indicating perhaps that those in smaller towns struggle more with the exams.

Expected Number Of Years Across Age Groups

The average number of years spent preparing for competitive exams as reported in our survey is 3 years and 3 months. Our qualitative findings suggest that this number hugely under-represents the time usually invested by those vying for government jobs. This is so because our survey sample was taken from outside coaching centres, while those who have been preparing for longer usually retire to distant neighbourhoods for self-study after a year or two of coaching. The veteran competitors, so to speak, are not adequately represented in our sample, particularly in smaller towns. A possible reason is that the cost of living is lower in smaller towns than metropolises such as Delhi, so competitors can continue to engage in self-study for longer.

As the number of years spent during taiyyari increases, expectations are often reduced while the pressure to get a job increases.

‚ÄúThe josh or enthusiasm of the early years plummets with cumulative years of failure,‚Äù said Amit Kumawat (name changed), who has been preparing for the last seven years. During this time, he has got married and has taken up tutoring as a part-time profession in Jaipur. ‚ÄúAt the outset applicants dream of being an inspector, but with time one finds oneself applying for every possible post, even that of a peon or a Group D [lowest category of government jobs] position,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt matter which job or what grade,‚Äù a 19-year-old applicant learning computer skills at a coaching institute in Jaipur told us, ‚ÄúWhat matters is how fast.‚Äù

Overqualified applicants make omnibus attempts for all possible vacancies, said an instructor at an Allahabad coaching institute. ‚ÄúOur generation started preparation only after graduation as BA/BSc serves as a foundation that is a precondition for any candidate to make an informed choice. But now students are starting preparations right after their high school while pursuing BA.‚Äù

(Un)helpfulness of previous educational training

Almost two of five persons in our sample‚Äìin which 91% of people were either graduates or postgraduates‚Äìsaid it had been unhelpful; 8% said their educational training thus far had been very helpful in preparing for their competitive exams.

Respondents belonging to rural areas, who have completed their education in Hindi, emphasised the extra amount of time and effort it takes them to reach at par with those who have benefitted from the opportunities available in urban areas.

The valuation of usefulness of education reduces from an overall average of 2.81 (out of 5) to 2.76 for those who belong to rural areas and have studied in Hindi. Further, it drops to 2.48 if we look only at the subset who completed their highest degrees from state government-run institutes (i.e. institutes that are rural, Hindi medium and run by state governments). Respondents from such backgrounds also seemed to value the services provided in coaching institutes more than those who received education in Central Universities or in English.

Of our respondents, 65% reported as hailing from rural backgrounds and 66% reported having last attended a government-run educational institute; 40% reported Hindi as the language of instruction in their educational training.

In Delhi, 80% of the respondents reported English as their language of educational instruction, while in Allahabad, 86% reported Hindi.

Several students in Allahabad emphasised the relative disadvantage those belonging to rural areas faced. While speaking to a group of students in the lawns outside the Central Library of the University of Allahabad, Ratnesh Yadav, a student, emphasised that the gap is created very early on in schooling. Those who cannot afford to take private schooling or are compelled to rely on public schools in rural areas, which are ill-equipped to provide quality education, lose out. So, once in the city, they have to come to terms with their disadvantages.

‚ÄúWe take about six months to settle down here after coming from our villages. Then begins the search for suitable coaching centres. After a year‚Äôs coaching, we take to self-study for another year. When we don‚Äôt get success, we take [a] second coaching [course] for another year and only by then do we start clearing cut-offs. Overall it takes at least 5 to 7 years for us to struggle for a job... if vacancies are regular, that is,‚Äù said Pradeep Rawat, another aspirant. It takes about 2 to 3 years for the candidate to adjust to the ways of learning and in finding out what jobs they can compete for.

Cost of preparation across cities

‚ÄúOnly those with relatively more money and ‚Äúbacking‚Äù [social capital] can afford to travel to Delhi,‚Äù said Rajiv, who teaches at a coaching institute in Allahabad. Hailing from nearby Ambedkarnagar, Rajiv was a competitor in Allahabad once, and estimates that the better half of competitors in Allahabad come from poor economic backgrounds. ‚ÄúI understand their situation as I myself was in their shoes once,‚Äù he said, having since graduated to becoming a coach himself. ‚ÄúI used to be apprehensive going to the tea stall in the evening. I would be left embarrassed if a friend came by and asked me to buy him a cup of tea. By the end of the month, I did not have the money to afford it.‚Äù

Like most of the competitors in Allahabad, Rajiv comes from a farming family that struggled to make ends meet. Agrarian distress features prominently in Rajiv‚Äôs worldview, as is the case with most other aspirants in smaller towns. While 22% of the respondents in Delhi cited agriculture as their primary source of family income, as many as 71% did in Allahabad (see figure below).

Again, while 50% of the respondents in Delhi came from a rural background, the figure was 92% in Allahabad and 87% in Jaipur (See figure below).

‚ÄúWhen a new edition of a workbook came to the market, I knew I would benefit by using it for practice. But it cost Rs 800-1,000. I knew if I would ask my family they would have to sell [the farm produce] at whatever rate they would get,‚Äù Rajiv said, ‚ÄúHence I would not tell them.‚Äù

We witnessed students bargaining for lower coaching fees at the institute we visited. Rajiv told us that such negotiations are not unusual as candidates often do not have the money to pay the full fees.

The difference in average annual coaching fees across the three cities surveyed are stark‚ÄìRs 11,449 in Allahabad compared to Rs 21,040 in Jaipur and Rs 65,351 in Delhi. The proportion of people preparing for higher-end job exams, such as the Union Public Service Commission, are also higher in Delhi, as compared to the other two places.

Renting accommodation in Allahabad on average costs a competitor Rs 3,737 per month; in Jaipur, Rs 4,677; and in Delhi, Rs 6,638 (See table below).

Overall annual expenditure per competitor, our survey shows, varies massively across the three cities. In Allahabad, a competitor spends on average Rs 1,52,303 in a year. In Jaipur, the annual average expenditure jumps 22% to Rs 1,95,130. In Delhi, the reported annual average expenditure of a competitor is Rs 2,97,168, nearly double of what they would be spending in Allahabad.

The figure below presents a picture of the class background of competitors in the three cities. In line with reported expenditures in the three cities, the figure shows as one moves from the more expensive cities (based on reported expenditure above) in the order of Delhi-Jaipur-Allahabad, there is a shift in the proportion of income groups that the respondents belong to.

The proportion of respondents belonging to the higher income group (monthly income of family = Rs 40,000+) is the highest in Delhi and the lowest in Allahabad.

The proportion of competitors belonging to the lower income group (monthly income of family <=20,000) is the highest in Allahabad (at 73% compared to 57% in Jaipur and 24% in Delhi).

Finally, can the deprived sections or those from oppressed castes within a village afford to send their wards away for years of preparation? Pradeep Rawat, a Scheduled Caste (SC) candidate, said that if jobs are adequate, vacancies are regular, and irregularities kept under check‚Äìi.e., if the probability of getting a job after a few years of efforts and investments is reasonable‚Äìthen even the most disadvantaged sections will invest in sending their kids in pursuit of jobs. He spoke of instances where families in villages he knew had taken loans to pay for their children‚Äôs taiyyari because they had seen someone in the village get a job after preparing in Allahabad.

But if the probability is low, the effect is negative. Our survey found that the upper castes and the Other Backward Classes form the majority of the competitors. Delhi sees the highest proportion of upper castes (52% reported being from the General, or Unreserved, category), while OBCs form a sizeable chunk in Allahabad. Candidates from the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe background constitute 9% and 8%, respectively, of the overall sample (See Figure below).

The unemployment industry

Libraries and paying guest facilities aim to attract students with WiFi, clean water, parking, air conditioning, charging points and a ‚Äúpositive environment‚Äù in Gujar ki Thadi in Jaipur, Rajasthan. Photo credit: Anirban Bhattacharya/IndiaSpend

As they prepare for competitive exams with the hope of securing a government job one day, the competitors bring economic gain to the coaching hubs and the localities where they are located. The unemployed, by staying unemployed, bring employment and economic gain to several others. Yuva Halla Bol, a campaign that helped bring this condition to wider notice, terms this the ‚Äúunemployment industry‚Äù. From lodges, paying guest houses, rental apartments and coaching institutes to photocopy shops, book and magazine stalls to small eateries, all rely on the consumption of competitive exam aspirants.

From our survey, we estimate that the total expense made by an average competitor in the local economies of Delhi, Jaipur and Allahabad is Rs 2,82,270, Rs 1,78,962 and Rs 1,40,708, respectively, on average per year.

It is a sector that thrives on the aspirations, uncertainties and desperation of the educated unemployed youth as they flock to these hubs in search of an avenue to a better life. The deeper the crisis of jobs, the more the returns of this sector.

And though the burden of this crisis is faced by the aspirants, the weight of it, as we have seen above, is disproportionately borne by those from disadvantaged class/caste backgrounds.

"Leak of India‚Äôs buried jobs data led to inquiry, panel examined officials‚Äô laptops and pen drives","A government committee set up in February examined computers and pen drives and interrogated officials in charge of printing documents in an effort to identify the source of a leaked report showing that unemployment figures had hit a four-decade high in the year after demonetisation. Details of the report were published in the Business Standard in January, after the government‚Äôs refusal to release the data prompted two senior officials of the National Statistical Commission to resign in protest the same month.

Although the committee ultimately did not pin the leak on any one person, its report submitted in June, recommended stringent efforts to restrict access to draft statistical reports, including putting a more senior official in charge of printing.

News of the committee‚Äôs inquiry comes just as the government has been left red-faced by another leaked report based on a survey from 2017-‚Äô18, this time showing that consumer expenditure fell for the first time in more than four decades. After details from the report were published in the Business Standard, the government said it was withholding the report because of ‚Äúdata quality‚Äù concerns. This means India is unlikely to have an official estimate of poverty levels for a whole decade.

Observers have highlighted this suppression of statistical reports and concerns about the methodology of calculating India‚Äôs Gross Domestic Product to question the veracity of economic data from the government. Many analysts have said bluntly that the official numbers are simply not trustworthy.

The month after the leak published in January, Pravin Srivastava, the Secretary of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, which oversees the functioning of India‚Äôs statistical bodies, wrote to the the National Sample Survey Office, which collected the unemployment data. He asked the organisation‚Äôs director general to ‚Äúconduct a comprehensive enquiry into the sequence of events leading to the alleged leak of the report of PLFS [periodic labour force surveys] and clear cut/unambiguous responsibility/accountability of concerned officers/officials if any be ascertained and established‚Äù.

Scroll.in emailed queries about the committee and its findings to Srivastava. This report will be updated if the ministry replies.

Thorough scrutiny

The order came soon after Business Standard revealed the numbers from the Periodic Labour Force Survey report, which showed unemployment at a 45-year high in 2017-‚Äô18. The report was cleared by the National Statistical Commission but withheld by the government. The data was eventually released after the Lok Sabha elections, with the government taking pains to insist it was not comparable to numbers from previous years and so could not be considered a 45-year high in unemployment.

As part of its inquiry into the leak, a three-member committee under the National Sample Survey Office looked into every aspect of the preparation of the Periodic Labour Force Survey, a survey that the Indian government has been conducting since 2017. It even examined the computers and pen drives of some individuals.

‚ÄúThe computer system[s]... were also scanned to ascertain whether any copy of such report/data files were still available on the system,‚Äù the report said. ‚ÄúThe Committee visited the conference hall and checked the laptop connected for making presentations and after scanning it was found that no Draft Report/Material related to PLFS is present on the laptop.‚Äù

In one case, it also sought testimony of officials about each other, concluding that one person ‚Äúhad been looking after this printing and binding‚Ä¶ for a long time and he is very sincere, reliable and particular in his duties. So far neither a single complaint has come nor any mistake/discrepancy observed in his work. Moreover his innocence is clearly established in he himself declaring that he was having the pen drive with him,‚Äù the report says.

Culprit unidentified

Ultimately, the inquiry committee concluded that it could not pin the blame on any single person.

‚ÄúCommittee after thorough exercise arrives at the conclusion that it is not established whether leakage of data/report in Business Standard or to Media is from any node of NSSO,‚Äù it said. ‚ÄúTherefore, in absence of any corroborative of circumstantial evidence, responsibility cannot be fixed on any official.‚Äù

That said, considering the government‚Äôs unhappiness with the leak, the ministry had also ordered the NSSO to ‚Äútake possible steps to put in place an institutional and systematic framework, so that such incidents do not occur in future and the sanctity of the National Statistical System is preserved‚Äù.

WIth this in mind, the committee made a few recommendations that involve treating data as if it is secret intelligence material. ‚ÄúSoft copy‚Ä¶ should be sent with a message that ‚Äòthe documents are strictly confidential and must not be shared with anyone till release of the Report‚Äô‚Äù, it said.

It added that the reports should be printed under ‚Äústrict vigil of Senior Officers‚Äù, adding that ‚Äúif required, level of head of Printing & Binding division may be upgraded to appropriate level‚Äù.

The committee also noted something that was crucial to the entire affair: ‚ÄúPresent system made available the soft copy of the report to all members of the SCLFS [Standing Committee on Labour Force Survey] and NSC [National Statistical Commission] without any caution/advice to the members against sharing of the report/data before release.‚Äù

In other words, nobody was told that the approved report was confidential information, not to be shared with anyone, reflecting the standard approach that this material is hardly secret or meant to be carefully guarded.

‚ÄúTherefore, any of the more than 20 participants in the meeting of SCLFS or NSC could have, intentionally or unintentionally shared the report with or without understanding the implication,‚Äù it said.",https://scroll.in/article/944716/inquiring-into-leak-of-indias-buried-jobless-data-panel-examined-officials-laptops-pen-drives,
Centre releases report that showed unemployment rose to 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18,"Unemployment in the country stood at 6.1% of the total labour force in 2017-‚Äô18, the highest in 45 years, according to a report released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation on Friday. This confirms the data leaked in the media in January after the government was accused of covering up the report.

The data showed that 7.8% of all employable youth in urban areas were jobless, while the figure was 5.3% in rural areas. Joblessness among men stood at 6.2%, while it was 5.7% in the case of women.

The data was published in the annual report of the Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2017-‚Äô18 conducted by the National Sample Survey Office.

According to the report, the unemployment rate among men in rural areas between the ages 15 and 29 years was 17.4% and 13.6% for women in the same age group. The unemployment rate among the urban male youth was 18.7% in 2017-‚Äô18, while the unemployment rate for female youth was 27.2%.

The survey is the first on employment by a government agency since demonetisation. The Periodic Labour Force Survey is also the first annual household survey of the National Sample Survey Office. Its data was collected between July 2017 and June 2018.

A report in the Business Standard on January 31 had claimed that a study allegedly kept buried by the government found unemployment at a 45-year-high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18 ‚Äì the first full year after demonetisation. Opposition leaders had used it as an opportunity to attack the government for demonetisation and allegedly covering up the report, while experts in the field, such as economist Kaushik Basu, had expressed concern about the figures. Two members of the National Statistical Commission resigned after the government refused to release the data.",https://scroll.in/latest/925501/centre-releases-report-that-showed-unemployment-rose-to-45-year-high-of-6-1-in-2017-18,
"The Daily Fix: Modi government bid to hide unemployment rate, other key data hurts Indian democracy","Two independent members of the National Statistical Commission have resigned over the past week. The trigger for the decision apparently was the alleged suppression of the latest National Sample Survey Office employment survey data. The commission now only has only two members, both government appointees. On Thursday, the Business Standard reported that the suppressed NSSO report showed that the unemployment rate in 2017-‚Äô18 stood at a four-decade high of 6.1%.

This is not the first time the Modi government has been accused of hiding official statistics. The National Statistical Commission was earlier involved in a controversy over the calculation of back series data after the Modi government chanted the method of calculating the gross domestic product ‚Äì the total value of goods and services produced in the country annually. The autonomous commission‚Äôs calculations found growth high during the Manmohan Singh years and low during Modi‚Äôs, while the Union government-controlled Central Statistics Office and the National Institution for Transforming India Aayog came to the opposite conclusion.

The Modi government has discontinued the Labour Bureau‚Äôs quarterly enterprises surveys, with the last report being released in March 2018. Moreover, the annual Employment-Unemployment Survey was also scrapped in 2017. The government now relies only on provident fund data to calculate employment ‚Äì a method widely criticised as being faulty.

The rate of unemployment among men in rural areas between the ages of 15 and 29 years jumped to 17.4% in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 5% in 2011-‚Äô12.

The data on the impact of the 2016 demonetisation of high value bank notes only came two years later. The National Crime Records Bureau has, for the first time, failed to publish its annual report, withholding data for 2017. The numbers on inter-state migration in the 2011 Census, collected eight years back, are also still under wraps as are the results of the 2011 Socio-Economic and Caste Census.

Through the Modi government‚Äôs last five years, red flags have been raised with respect to the undermining of institutions. These include the classifying of proposed legislation as money bills to evade Rajya Sabha scrutiny, attacks by the ruling party on the Supreme Court over the Ayodhya dispute, serious allegations of partisan political bias in the Central Bureau of Investigation as well as mismanagement of the Reserve Bank of India.

In this, the suppression of institutions that deal with official statistics might be the most serious. Information is vital to a democracy, allowing voters to make informed political choices. Before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Indians have a right to know how their elected Union government has performed over the past five years in order to evaluate it at the hustings. Suppressing official data on the state of the country has the potential to seriously damage India‚Äôs democratic set up.

‚ÄòHalf positive‚Äô: How will the Modi government spin shocking jobs data from its own survey?,"Demonetisation destroyed millions of jobs. This much is clear after a report in the Business Standard revealed that unemployment spiked to a 45-year high according to data from the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Review for 2017-‚Äô18. This is the same survey that Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government had been accused of burying earlier this week, when two members of the National Statistical Commission resigned after the government refused to release the data. It now seems evident why the government would want to suppress these numbers.

After promising to deliver millions of jobs to India‚Äôs youth in his election speeches in 2013 and 2014, Modi suddenly began arguing mid-way through his term ‚Äì amid accusations of anemic job growth ‚Äì that the problem was not lack of jobs, but lack of employment data. Modi and his government insisted that India did not have enough high quality information about jobs, leading to his infamous pakodanomics comment.

One of the devices that was supposed to fix this porblem was the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Review. A NITI Aayog Task Force on Improving Employment Data said as much in 2017. Acknowledging that household surveys are the only way to generate economy-wide estimates of employment, the task force‚Äôs report said that the new annual labour force review would ‚Äúgo a long way towards fulfilling the current vacuum in the availability of information relating to India‚Äôs labour markets‚Äù.

The labour force review was launched by the Modi government in April 2017, and according to reports, only after prodding from the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office to the ministry to get it going. In its 2017 annual report, the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation acknowledged the utility of the labour force review and said that a new tech-based approach would ‚Äúlead to higher accuracy and faster processing of data‚Äù.

The data was then collected, prepared and passed on to the National Statistical Commission for vetting. But even after it was cleared by the commission, the government did not release it, leading to resignations from the statistical commission. ‚ÄúThe government not releasing the [jobs] report is one of the reasons,‚Äù said PC Mohanan, who was acting chair of the commission. ‚ÄúWe have approved the report, but they have not released it, I don‚Äôt know why.‚Äù

The Business Standard report leaves no doubt about why the government had not put it out. According to the report, unemployment was at 45-year high following Modi‚Äôs demonetisation move, in which 86% of currency was withdrawn from the system with the aim of uncovering black money. Demonetisation did not achieve any of its stated goals. But the distress it caused to the rural economy, and the jobs lost as a result were apparent anecdotally. Now the data confirms this.

As per the report, rural unemployment among young men went from 5% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 17% in 2017-‚Äô18. The figures were even worse among urban youth, with unemployment among men going from 8.1% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 18.7%, and among urban women from 13.1% in 2011-‚Äô12 to 27.2% in 2017-‚Äô18. Overall, the report also shows that Labour Force Participation is down, meaning fewer people as a proportion of the overall population are working or looking for jobs. It said that the country‚Äôs overall unemployment rate was at 6.1%, a 45-year high, and a huge spike compared to the 2% in 2011-‚Äô12.

More than anything, this data is confirmation of how large the effect of demonetisation was on the Indian economy. Even former Chief Economic Adviser to Modi, Arvind Subramanian, called a ‚Äúmassive, draconian‚Äù shock. When coupled with the complete failure to achieve any of the note ban‚Äôs goals, and the fact that the move was done at a time of benign global economic conditions, it serves only as further proof of how one of Modi‚Äôs landmark moves taken with little consultation has turned out to be a gigantic boondoggle.

As of noon, the government has yet to respond to the report, although the Chief Statistician of India said that the results of the NSSO survey will not be available for at least another month. But some responses from those who are generally in favour of the government‚Äôs policies gave an indication of how the Bharatiya Janata Party would seek to spin this revelation.

"Voters need jobs, not leaked jobs data ‚Äì and that is BJP's real problem","One of the more interesting things about WhatsApp forwards is how old jokes are adapted. I recently received a riff on a joke that (probably) originated in the mid-1970s Soviet Union. In the original, a train carrying three Soviet leaders suddenly stops in the middle of nowhere. Joseph Stalin wants to shoot the driver, Nikita Khrushchev wants to set up a committee to enquire into the causes of the stoppage. Leonid Brezhnev says, ‚ÄúThere is food and drink. It is warm and comfortable. Let‚Äôs just pretend the train is chugging along.‚Äù

In the desi version, one ruling party politician says, ‚ÄúI shall now give a thundering speech blaming Nehru for the stoppage.‚Äù Another wants a Central Bureau of Investigation enquiry and a tax raid directed against the ‚Äúanti-national train driver‚Äù. A third says, ‚ÄúYaar, we have chai and pakodas. Let‚Äôs just pretend the train is chugging along.‚Äù

In both versions, of course, the train represents the economy. And the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pretend‚Äù factor is high in both regimes. Statisticians of the Soviet Union spent much of their time cooking up fantasies about high growth economy, while concealing telltale signs of stagnation. The Bharatiya Janata Party seems to have spent the last five years doing much the same.

Some of India‚Äôs statisticians have started to baulk at being asked to cook up fantasies. The last two independent members of the National Statistical Commission have resigned, citing problems with the government‚Äôs attitude to statistical data. The new ‚Äúback series‚Äù of GDP data was released without the commission signing off on it (the version prepared by the commission was rejected). The government‚Äôs refusal to release the National Sample Survey Organisation‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey, or PLFS, for 2017-‚Äô18 was apparently the last straw for these two statisticians. According to them, the report was readied in December.

The unreleased PLFS has now leaked. It shows that unemployment hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18, with joblessness among the ‚Äúyouth‚Äù being far higher. The unemployment rate among rural men in the 15-29 age group jumped over three times to 17.4% in 2017-‚Äô18 from 5% in 2011-‚Äô12. Similarly, joblessness among women aged 15 to 29 in rural areas stood at 13.6% in 2017-‚Äô18 compared to 4.8% in 2011-‚Äô12. The unemployment rate for the urban youth was even higher, 18.7% for men and 27.2% for women. The Labour Force Participation Rate declined as well.

The PLFS was conducted between July 2017 and June 2018. That puts both demonetisation (declared in November 2016) and the Goods and Services Tax (launched in July 2017) squarely in the dock since it is hard to see what else could have been responsible.

The PLFS results tally with other evidence that the Modi government has tried to sweep under the carpet. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy‚Äôs employment surveys, which gain in importance in the absence of government data, suggest a terrifying situation, with job losses amounting to 11 million. As Mahesh Vyas, managing director of the centre, writes, ‚ÄúIn December 2018, an estimated 397 million people were employed. This is nearly 11 million less than the employment estimate for December 2017.‚Äù

By the centre‚Äôs estimate, unemployment was running at close to 8% in December 2018.

‚ÄòContradictory nonsense‚Äô

Meanwhile, the report of the parliamentary panel on GDP growth, led by the BJP‚Äôs Murli Manohar Joshi, has also been delayed, apparently because of dissent by three BJP members. The report is believed to conclude that there is no reliable government data on jobs. Apart from delaying the PLFS, the government has stopped the Labour Bureau‚Äôs Quarterly Employment Surveys, removing another useful data source.

Conclusions of the suppressed PLFS can be backed up by anecdotal evidence. Low-level jobs have attracted insanely huge numbers of overqualified applicants in the past two years. Around 1,90,00,000 candidates, including some with PhDs, applied when the Railways advertised 63,000 low-level and mid-level jobs last year. There have been agitations and riots by the Jats, Marathas and Patels ‚Äì land-owning upper castes ‚Äì demanding reservation in jobs. This is a sign that traditional employment opportunities are declining across vast swathes of India.

Government-speak about unemployment has essentially consisted of contradictory nonsense. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said people selling pakodas are employed, which is true. But pakoda-sellers are out of the formal economy and not taxpayers. Nor do they accept digital payments. Does that not run counter to highfalutin claims of formalising employment, and going cashless?

Piyush Goyal has said traditional data-collection methods do not pick up on new employment opportunities such as driving of Ola and Uber cabs. Perhaps not. But formal financials do pick up on the fact that these ride-sharing companies are burning cash. Also, any survey of cabbies will alert you to the fact that they are struggling to repay their car loans. There is formal data indicating a slowdown in the automobile market as well. This shouldn‚Äôt be the case if ride-sharing is a rapidly growing industry.

Statistical data about jobs is important for policymakers. Suppressing the data won‚Äôt really do much to change the hearts and minds of voters even if it makes it easier for politicians to lie and obfuscate on the campaign trail.

What would be the possible electoral impact of joblessness? Here‚Äôs a simple explanation.

There were 150 million first-time voters in 2014. Many of them were job-seekers who bought the BJP‚Äôs rhetoric about creating 20 million jobs every year. Their votes contributed a substantial chunk of the BJP‚Äôs 31% vote share in 2014. There are nearly 130 million first-time voters now. Many of their older siblings voted for the BJP in 2014.

The BJP needs to retain the support of those among the 150-million cohort who voted for it in 2014. They are now five years older ‚Äì and many are unemployed. The party also needs the votes of the 130 million newbies. Some of them have watched their older siblings go through the heartbreak of unemployment.

Will the 2014 cohort keep faith with the messiah who promised them Achhe Din, but gave them demonetisation and pakodanomics instead?

What about the 130 million new voters? Will they believe new promises from a government that failed to take advantage of four benign years of global growth to create employment? Or will they draw their own conclusions after observing the economic condition of their older siblings?

India‚Äôs employment data is fuzzy but one thing is certain ‚Äì Modi has failed to deliver promised jobs

By delaying the release of GDP back series, Modi government is harming India‚Äôs economic ecosystem",https://scroll.in/article/911562/leaked-employment-survey-clinches-the-debate-demonetisation-and-gst-destroyed-millions-of-jobs,
India‚Äôs employment data is fuzzy but one thing is certain ‚Äì Modi has failed to deliver promised jobs,"One of the many promises Narendra Modi made on the campaign trail in 2014 was that the Bharatiya Janata Party would generate employment. The party‚Äôs manifesto promised 25 crore new jobs over 10 years, or 2.5 crore a year.

Given India‚Äôs demographics ‚Äì there were over 15 crore first-time voters in 2014 ‚Äì this was a potent reason to vote for the BJP. In the 2019 election, some 13 crore young men and women will be eligible to vote for the first time. In all, there will be over 28 crore voters in the 18-25 age group, and a large proportion of them will be looking to earn a living. The working-age population is generally assumed to mean all people aged 15 to 65. But not everybody seeks, or finds, a job.

Nearly 1.3 crore Indians leave the workforce every year because they cross 65 years of age, or die. On the other hand, over 2.5 crore citizens celebrate their 15th birthdays every year. This means 1.2 crore people effectively join the workforce every year. The World Bank estimates the number is closer to 1.56 crore, or 13 lakh per month. This is India‚Äôs so-called demographic dividend.

Commonly, economic growth comes from higher per capita productivity, that is, the same workforce produces more, or a larger workforce, which ensures growth even with flat productivity. A bulge at the younger end of the working population guarantees strong growth for decades, subject, of course, to the workforce being productively employed. In India‚Äôs case, the economy needs to create employment for roughly 10 lakh people a month to cash in on the demographic dividend.

But anecdotal evidence and most of the available data indicates that, four years into the BJP‚Äôs term, unemployment remains a big concern. In 2017, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that 30% of Indians aged 18 to 29 were unemployed and looking for work.

‚ÄúPakoda gate‚Äù is an implicit admission that Modi has not been able to deliver on the jobs front. In March 2018, 2.8 crore people applied for 90,000 jobs with the Indian Railways. That is a huge, huge number, any way you look at it. Joblessness seems to haunt even the highly qualified. In February, around 19 lakh candidates applied for a total of 9,500 posts of typists, stenographers and Village Administrative officers in Tamil Nadu. They included 992 PhDs and 23,000 MPhils.

Sketchy data

India‚Äôs employment data is sketchy, some is even contradictory. The country‚Äôs informal workforce far outnumbers the formal workforce, although formal employment is growing. A rough estimate based on data collected by the National Sample Survey Office shows 50-55 crore Indians are aged 15-65. Of them, around 22 crore are employed in agriculture and about 28 crore in non-agriculture sectors. Because the agriculture sector is underpaid and ‚Äúoverstaffed‚Äù, many of those employed in it are attempting to shift to non-agriculture work.

Of the non-agriculture jobs, only around 6 crore are formal. One reason is India‚Äôs complicated labour laws, which incentivise employers, including large corporations and the Railways, to deploy contract labour rather than offer formal employment.

Another problem is late compilation of employment data. The Labour Bureau‚Äôs quarterly reports are based on surveys and released six to nine months late. Moreover, the Quarterly Employment Surveys only cover units employing 10 persons or more, in sectors such as manufacturing, construction, trade, transport, hotels, information technology and business process outsourcing, education, and health. Around 2.11 crore people were employed in such units of these sectors on October 1, 2017, according to the latest quarterly surveys. The number was 2.05 crore on April 1, 2016. The surveys cover only about 5% of the workforce.

The net employment gain in the units covered by the quarterly surveys was around 6 lakh over 18 months from April 2016 to October 2017. If similar patterns hold across the economy, nearly a third of those who entered the workforce in that period would not have found employment.

In an effort to understand India‚Äôs labour conundrum, the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation released data to the NITI Aayog, which passed it onto researchers Soumya Kanti Ghosh and Pulak Ghosh for a study published in April 2018. The data is not supposed to be made public, and there was a privacy scandal since the data contained sensitive personal information, including names and contribution amounts. There was also a ridiculous attempt to pass off Ghosh and Ghosh‚Äôs work as an independent study.

Such absurdities aside, the data suggested that about 70 lakh new Employee Provident Fund accounts were opened in 2017-18, about 40 lakh of those by persons under 25. But many of the new accounts may actually have been opened by people who were already employed but had now come under the formal umbrella. A new scheme allows employers to file declarations for unregistered employees with a nominal fine of Rs 1 per year. The Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation has added 1,01,31,453 subscribers under the new scheme.

Unemployment problem

The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a private sector research unit, works with the Bombay Stock Exchange to gather employment data across a wider base ‚Äì smaller units and more sectors ‚Äì than the Quarterly Employment Surveys. The CMIE-BSE surveys found 40.5 crore people were employed as of March 2017, with the unemployment rate running at about 4.7%. By April 2018, the unemployment rate had risen above 6%.

Mahesh Vyas of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy explained that around 1.26 crore jobs were lost during the first two months after demonetisation, declared in November 2016. ‚ÄúThe labour force shrunk by 19 million during this period,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúThis shrinking of the labour force is the shrinking of hopes of getting jobs. We still do not see a recovery in the labour force. Labour participation rate in January-March 2018 was 43.4% compared to 46.8% in January-March 2016.‚Äù

The labour participation rate is defined as the number of working-age people who are either employed or seeking employment.

Now, for the contradictions. India‚Äôs economy is supposedly growing at 6.7% of the Gross Domestic Product and it is often tom-tommed as the world‚Äôs fastest growing large economy. How does this gel with 2.8 crore people ‚Äì 10% of the under-25 electorate ‚Äì applying for a few relatively low-paid railway jobs? The other side of the equation: over 2.2 crore cars and two-wheelers were sold in India in 2017-18. Let‚Äôs say half of these were replacements. If unemployment has hit a nadir, who bought all the cars and bikes?

My unscientific guess: unemployment is a serious problem but it is hard to understand its real dimensions because of the large informal component of the Indian economy. This will be a major issue in the 2019 election. The fuzzy nature of the available data provides ample room for any and every politician to airily toss out promises about generating more employment. Whether such promises would be credible is another matter.",https://scroll.in/article/881791/indias-employment-data-is-fuzzy-but-one-thing-is-certain-modi-has-failed-to-deliver-promised-jobs,
"Modi‚Äôs 2019 budget: What it can do about India‚Äôs jobs crisis, but probably won‚Äôt do","It seems obvious to everyone that India is in the throes of an unemployment crisis.

The lack of jobs is especially debilitating for the country‚Äôs youth, who lack the opportunities to meet their aspirations. For prime minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government, the crisis is a political liability, which can be used against it in the upcoming general elections, given the ambitious promises it made five years ago.

The government and its officials may acknowledge the dire situation internally, but in public, they appear to be in a state of denial and in a mood for cover-up.

For one, the Modi government refuses to release reports by India‚Äôs national sample survey office and its labour bureau, even as it disparages a large survey by a private organisation that has found significant declines in employment.

The prime minister, and sundry spokespersons, desperately scrounge around for signs of what can be interpreted as employment dynamism. They cite indicators such as increased vehicle registrations, the numbers of professional service providers, and even the sales of autorickshaws. The exuberant assumption being, three new jobs for every two autorickshaws!

The attempt to ignore or deflect from the real problems reflects the uneasy belief, in official circles, that there is little that can be done to lift employment numbers before the general elections, expected around May.

The Brahmastra, or ultimate weapon, of 10% reservation in government employment for economically weaker sections has been cynically deployed already, but even that does not seem to be delivering the desired public approval. Perhaps the general public has wised up to the fact that central government jobs have in fact declined over the past four years (by more than 75,000 since 2014) and so a small reserved portion of a shrinking pie does not seem all that attractive.

However, even in the limited time available, there is much a committed government can do to tackle unemployment. And these could find expression in Budget 2019, as three measures.

Vacancies, pay scale, and MGNREGA

The first is almost laughably simple: Fill up the vacancies.

By current estimates, there are around 2.4 million vacant positions in central government ministries, departments, and public undertakings. Some of these positions have been vacant for years, to the detriment of the functioning of these organisations and the quality of public service delivery.

Schools and colleges lack teachers, and hospitals and clinics lack doctors, nurses, and support staff. Much of the work is then done by those working in ad hoc positions or as contract workers with lower wages and insecure tenure. Even if filling these positions will take time, an explicit declaration of intent and budget provisions for such employment would have a positive impact.

Second, the government must stop trying to provide essential health and nutrition services on the cheap. India‚Äôs accredited social health activists, auxillary nurse mid-wives, anganwadi workers, and mid-day meal providers get paid much less than the minimum wage. The government should ensure that such workers get at least minimum wages and security of tenure.

Suppose the government stops under-providing such services, and expands them to fulfil the supreme court guidelines and its own legal commitments, it would expand employment and deliver better-quality jobs. (It would also reduce gender wage gaps, another positive fallout.)

Third, the government could adhere to both the spirit and the letter of the law in terms of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, which mandates at least 100 days of work to all rural households who demand such work or payment of unemployment allowance at half the minimum wage if such work is not provided.

So far, the government has blatantly reneged on this promise, and starved the state governments of funds by carrying over large unpaid obligations each year. As a demand-driven programme, the law states that money must be made available whenever there is demand for work, but the government has simply passed over such claims and pushed payments to the next financial year.

This forces state governments to cut back and delay wage payments (often for a year or more) and encourages central and state governments to reduce the explicit demand for work or even cover it up in various ways. At least eight states in India now face major drought conditions and urgently need more such work, but the budgetary allocation for the year is exhausted and must be replenished.

Now, here‚Äôs why Modi won‚Äôt do it

Of course, all this will cost money. But these are all employment-intensive activities with very high multiplier effects, so they will generate many more additional jobs indirectly and have much-needed positive effects on aggregate demand.

So why is it unlikely that the budget will incorporate any of these? The straight answer is the constraint of ‚Äúfiscal discipline‚Äù, a sandbag of sorts that is dragging down any possibility of such spending.

The inability to increase tax revenues by getting rid of exemptions and instituting wealth and inheritance taxes is often presented as an economic compulsion, but it reflects the absence of political will. The need to conform to the unimaginative FRBM Act (with fiscal and revenue deficit limits simply copied from elsewhere rather than derived from independent reasoned analysis) is used to avoid any such increases in expenditure that would actually benefit the public.

But the truth is that the government constantly cheats on the FRBM Act anyway, through increased ‚Äúoff-budget‚Äù expenditures, misstatement of receipts, and holding back payments that pushes the debt onto other entities.

So fiscal discipline is only an excuse, disguising the government‚Äôs unwillingness to put its money where its mouth has been for a while. And so the budget is unlikely to do anything meaningful towards dealing with the employment crisis.

It‚Äôs now up to the electorate to make employment creation a pressing political compulsion.

‚ÄòHappy days are over‚Äô: Workers return empty-handed from Delhi‚Äôs labour hubs as jobs slowly disappear,"As the midday May sun blazed overhead and the temperature rose to 42 degrees Celsius, several construction workers stood or sat on the pavement where they gathered every day, waiting to be picked up for odd jobs by prospective employers. The last batch of workers had been picked up two-and-a-half hours ago, at 10 am and no more employers came along.

Yet, they waited, nearly six hours after getting to Harola in Eastern Delhi. The lucky ones got picked by 7 am, others later. The unlucky ones hung on until hope ran out and they headed home.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a daily routine here,‚Äù said 32-year-old Ram Kripal, a daily wage labourer left behind at Harola. The numbers of those left behind began to rise after demonetisation ‚Äì the withdrawal of 86%, by value, of India‚Äôs currency ‚Äì in November 2016, said Javed Ibrahim. From 2,000 to 3,000 daily wage workers who found employment here every day that year, fewer than 1,000 find work today, he said.

The Harola labour hub in Sector 5, Noida, is one of the major gathering points for those who seek daily wage work in Delhi‚Äôs informal economy. It is also an embodiment of India‚Äôs dichotomies.

The hundreds who gathered here daily to beg for a day‚Äôs work amidst dust, smoke and smog, did so on a street surrounded by high-rise, chrome-and-glass buildings and towers. As the men and women in torn, stained clothes and sweat-drenched bodies waited, others drove by in the latest cars, in matching suits, shiny shoes and briefcases.

At Harola and other labour hubs in the national capital region of Delhi ‚Äì India‚Äôs largest urban agglomeration with 46 million people ‚Äì labourers take whatever work is offered: at brick kilns, as rag pickers, at construction sites, in homes, lifting and moving goods. Those jobs are diminishing, as the number of workers at labour hubs swell.

Demonetisation came to India‚Äôs capital and its informal economy at a time when businesses were being shut across Delhi for working in residential areas without licences and in industrial East Delhi for polluting the air of what is one of the world‚Äôs most-polluted cities. These triple blows were made worse by the July 2017 implementation of the goods and services tax, widely criticised for its hasty, often chaotic implementation.

India‚Äôs informal sector which absorbs the country‚Äôs mass of illiterate, semi-educated and qualified-but-jobless people, employs 92% of India‚Äôs workforce, according to a 2016 International Labour Organization study that used government data.

By delving into the lives and hopes of informal workers, IndiaSpend provides a perspective to ongoing national controversies over job losses. The number of jobs declined by a third over four years to 2018, according to a survey by the All India Manufacturers‚Äô Organisation, which polled 34,700 of its 300,000 member-units.

In 2018 alone, 11 million jobs were lost, mostly in the unorganised rural sector, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a consultancy. The unemployment rate in 2017-‚Äô18 was 6.1%, a 45-year high, according to the Periodic Labour Force Survey, released by the National Sample Survey Office in May. The same report said 71.1% of salaried workers in the unorganised sector ‚Äì excluding the agricultural sector ‚Äì had no job contract.

The end of happy days

Raju Prajapati, 39, was wearing an unbuttoned half-sleeved shirt and clumsily folded pants, as he reminisced his ‚Äúhappy days‚Äù, living with his father, mother and wife in Gokalpuri in North East Delhi.

Disinterested in education, Raju dropped out after Class 9 and dabbled in odd jobs till, in 2008, he started frequenting the labour hubs of Harola and Burari ‚Äì about 28 km to the North ‚Äì to find daily construction work. He found almost 25 days of work a month, earned around Rs 12,000 every month, enough to afford food and shelter.

On November 8, 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi decided to cancel the validity of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, everything changed for the Prajapatis.

Raju said he found work at a construction site only seven months after demonetisation.

‚ÄúDemonetisation was a black day for us,‚Äù said Ganesh Prajapati, 67, a construction worker like his son Raju. ‚ÄúOnly we [the family] know the struggle we faced to survive those days.‚Äù

Ganesh‚Äôs income has dropped from between Rs 12,000 and Rs 15,000 to around Rs 8,000. Raju said he struggled to earn between Rs 6,000 and Rs 7,000 per month and worked for about 16 days a month.

As the job crisis worsened, Raju left his family home in Gokalpuri in July 2017 and moved to the interiors of Harola village, so he could be close to the labour hub.

He lives in a smelly, shared room with a fellow worker and must travel 1.5 km to get drinking water every day. They struggle to pay the monthly rent of Rs 1,100 on time, like other tenants, so the landlord dismisses all complaints about ramshackle living conditions.

Raju‚Äôs wife has moved back to her parents‚Äô house within the national capital region and he now visits her only once a month.

Before demonetisation, Raju could save up to Rs 3,000 a month. Now, he saves nothing.

We found different versions of the Prajapatis‚Äô story repeated at other labour hubs in the national capital region.

Same woes across hubs

Delhi‚Äôs 17th-century Chandni Chowk is one of the city‚Äôs busiest markets ‚Äì its teeming streets visited by half a million people every day and its narrow lanes packed with small-scale industrial units and wholesale markets.

After demonetisation, Chandni Chowk businesses lost about 70% of their turnover, the Business Standard reported in May.

Most of these small-scale industries and markets employed workers on informal contracts and when the economy declined, these workers joined those on the streets at labour hubs, swelling the already large numbers there.

‚ÄúThere is a sense of insecurity and concern among labourers,‚Äù said Zakir Malik, 29, a daily wage labourer at Chawri Bazar, one of Delhi‚Äôs largest labour hubs and part of the Chandni Chowk area. ‚ÄúDaily wage work is reducing day-by-day here and across other labour hubs like Burari and Mahipalpur.‚Äù

The Mahipalpur labour hub in South Delhi ‚Äì one of the city‚Äôs most prosperous areas ‚Äì is marked by narrow roads, chaotic traffic, broken footpaths and dejected workers.

After demonetisation, the crowds thinned at the Mahipalpur labour hub, as workers either moved back to their native regions or migrated to areas like Noida.

The Mahipalpur labour hub is now primarily a parking area for rickshaw pullers. ‚ÄúThere were three major labour hubs in Delhi: Mahipalpur, Chawri Bazaar and Burari,‚Äù said Subhash Chand Mishra, 46, a former labour contractor. ‚ÄúCurrently, all of these serve as rickshaw pullers‚Äô stands.‚Äù

Sonu Kumar, 30, was a daily wage worker but tired of waiting for jobs and being dependent on labour contractors. Credit: Ashish Mani Tiwari/IndiaSpend

The downturn has affected not just labourers but contractors. ‚ÄúFrankly, a labour-contracting job was really fine in Delhi and the national capital region,‚Äù said Mishra, ‚ÄúBut since demonetisation, labourers and labour contractors, both have been ruined.‚Äù

Today, at the Mahipalpur labour hub, it is rare to find labourers between 7 am and 10 am, Mishra said. ‚ÄúNow, everyone looks towards Noida.‚Äù Although there is work to be found at residential- and office-tower construction sites, there are, as we said earlier, not enough jobs.

Mishra‚Äôs story reveals how even relative prosperity diminished after demonetisation and did not return.

After getting a Bachelor of Arts degree in his home town of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, Mishra started a grocery shop but closed it later, hoping for better prospects, which he found in Delhi in 2007 as a labour contractor.

Mishra hired large groups of daily wage workers from labour hubs and shipped them to jobs at South Delhi‚Äôs Okhla industrial area. Before demonetisation, Mishra earned between Rs 30,000 and Rs 40,000 every month and saved enough to rent a flat in north Delhi‚Äôs Adarsh Nagar, where he lived with his wife and two children.

Now, Mishra lives in a single room near Sangam Vihar in South Delhi. He moved out of his flat after he could not find enough work for the labourers he once gathered. He is now an Uber driver, earning about the same amount, about Rs 40,000 a month. But expenses grew and Mishra‚Äôs family moved back to Lucknow to save money.

Like Mishra, others down the chain have tried to move on, such as Sonu Kumar, 30, a migrant from Bihar who found pulling a rickshaw a better, more independent job, he said, than waiting at a labour hub every day and living under a contractor‚Äôs thumb.

Mishra and Kumar‚Äôs diminished job prospects are a reflection of the difficulties that Delhi‚Äôs industrial areas faced after not just demonetisation but GST and court orders shutting down businesses in residential areas and those that caused pollution.

GST, sealing, pollution

Mayapuri Phase-II in West Delhi is one of India‚Äôs largest iron-trading hubs for small traders, micro and small enterprises, from scrap dealers to vehicle workshops, where unskilled and skilled workers come to find work.

While demonetisation led to the closure of several small-scale industries and left informal sector workers unemployed, GST played a significant role in adding to the financial stress.

‚ÄúThe filing system of GST is very complicated, it has functionalities such as drop-down menus, invoice upload, upload of purchase and many more,‚Äù said Jatin Sharma, 52, an iron trader. ‚ÄúAll these activities kill time and money of small traders. We can not afford professionals to look after all these things.‚Äù

Dinesh Makol, 46, executive committee member of the Mayapuri Industrial Welfare Association, explained that several small-scale industry owners in New Delhi had invested personal savings to run their businesses. Demonetisation and GST stopped iron distribution, wrecked the lives of owners and hundreds of jobs were lost, said Makol, who runs a cast-iron manufacturing unit.

The end of cash transactions killed business and taxes under GST rose from 2% to 18%.

‚ÄúA big scarcity of iron was created in Mayapuri for months and all units had stopped working for a while,‚Äù said Ganesh Tanwar, 29, a Mayapuri vendor. Many shut permanently, said Makol.

Rishabh Shah, 37, said the market was closed for almost three months and labourers moved back to their native places.

The situation was made worse by the Delhi government‚Äôs drive to shut down unauthorised businesses in residential areas, driven by a Supreme Court monitoring committee. By January 31, 2017, at least 10,533 commercial units, including shops, restaurants, bars and bakeries were shuttered.

In 2016, before demonetisation, the National Green Tribunal ordered the shutdown of unauthorised industrial units in east Delhi to curb pollution. Based on this, the Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation identified 51,837 units that needed to be relocated or closed. The hardest hit were informal-sector workers. While working at these industrial units put them at risk of exposure to toxic air pollutants, they had stable monthly incomes.

Mayapuri was one of the most affected by the sealing drive and several times over 2018, traders have taken to the streets in protest. At a press conference in April, Brijesh Goyal, head of the Aam Aadmi Party‚Äôs trade wing, assured traders that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal planned to move the Supreme Court against their sealing order.

Meanwhile, on the streets of Mayapuri, workers spend their days playing cards, waiting for factory owners to hire them.

Dark days before demonetisation

Few labourers we spoke to expected the government to provide jobs, but they did express a desire for waiting sheds, drinking water facilities and a labour union that could fight for Delhi‚Äôs minimum wage: Rs 399 for unskilled labour and Rs 485 for skilled labour.

With almost 1.3 million unemployed people in 2016, Delhi‚Äôs jobless rate surged 6% over the year from 2015, according to the Economic Survey of Delhi 2017-‚Äô18, the latest available local data.

Demonetisation, GST, sealing and anti-pollution measures worsened the prospects of getting a job, but experts said such opportunities were already scarce for those without proper education.

‚ÄúThere is an impression within people that Delhi has several opportunities for labourers,‚Äù said J John of the Centre for Education and Communication, an advocacy group. ‚ÄúHowever, that‚Äôs not the actual scenario. Before demonetisation, it was average and post-demonetisation it has become worse.‚Äù

Brick-kiln worker and migrant from Bihar, Parvati Kumari, 29, said ‚Äúnothing has changed‚Äù for labourers in the national capital region over the last five years. A Class 10 dropout, she lives with her husband, a cab driver and is never certain of finding work for the day. Since demonetisation, her income has dropped from Rs 8,000 to Rs 7,000.

‚ÄúWe struggled to get one proper meal a day and we are still struggling,‚Äù she said.

Tracking unemployment, however, is difficult in India‚Äôs capital because data appears to be unreliable.

Delhi‚Äôs dodgy data

From the situation at Delhi‚Äôs labour hubs and industrial areas, it is apparent that unemployment among daily wage workers is widespread.

For instance, after demonetisation, hundreds of lost jobs and businesses were shut in Sangam Vihar‚Äôs garment factories, considered to be one of Asia‚Äôs largest unauthorised neighbourhoods, said John. Home to more than a million, Sangam Vihar‚Äôs people are mostly poor migrants.

But as in the rest of Delhi, tracking jobs lost and gained is difficult because there are no clear data, he said.

In 2016, Delhi had an average unemployment rate of 10.31%, going up to 17.3% in May 2016 ‚Äì before demonetisation, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy‚Äôs unemployment data.

Unemployment was at its lowest between June 2017 and April 2018, at an average of 3.6%, falling to 1.6% in February 2018. In May 2018, the unemployment rate rose to 8.8% and has increased since. In the first four months of 2019, the unemployment rate has averaged 11.32%.

These spikes are hard to analyse because employment rises and falls gradually, said experts.

‚ÄúWhile the unemployment data itself is of concern and requires further analysis, it is important to highlight that there is a need for an independent and globally aligned system for capturing real-time unemployment data,‚Äù said Utkarsha Bhardwaj, a Delhi-based social-impact consultant.

Without reliable data and a strategy, government social-welfare programmes for the jobless and unemployment programmes appear to be shots in the dark.

Said Bhardwaj: ‚ÄúWhile the skills mission launched by the Delhi state government and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana launched by the Union government are notable attempts to address some of the prevalent issues, they need to focus on the existing employment exchanges and develop them as a one-stop platform for not just gathering and maintaining real-time data on skills, employment, and available opportunities in the market, but also collaborate with academia and industries to present viable job options for those seeking employment.‚Äù

Employment opportunities can improve only if it is easy to run a business, which it currently does not appear to be in Delhi.

Making business difficult

In March 2019, the Reserve Bank of India released data on the ease of doing business in Indian states. Based on the rankings over the last three years, Delhi slipped the most, falling from the 15th spot in 2015 to 23rd in 2017. Andhra Pradesh tops the ranks, Telangana is second and Delhi‚Äôs neighbour, Haryana, is third.

‚ÄúVery high cost of industrial land makes it impossible for aspiring young entrepreneurs to make the initial investment and stay viable in Delhi and the national capital region‚Äôs micro, medium and small enterprises market,‚Äù said Suman Chawla, proprietor of a leather-goods manufacturing company called V&M Exports.

Land is likely to get costlier by 15% to 20%, a real-estate developers‚Äô association predicts, but even if it does not, the shortage of skilled workers is a problem that continues amidst visible unemployment and numerous government programmes.

For instance, the National Skill Development Mission was launched in July 2015 to coordinate the efforts of the National Skill Development Agency, the National Skill Development Corporation and the Directorate General of Training, but at the labour hubs, workers told us they were unaware of job-training programmes and had never registered for any.

The Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana, launched in 2016 ‚Äì a programme under the National Skill Development Mission ‚Äì promised free training in soft skills, entrepreneurship and financial and digital literacy to those who are school or college dropouts or unemployed, roughly about 10 million Indians by 2020, with a budget of Rs 12,000 crore. However, no more than a third of that target was achieved by January, Al Jazeera reported in May.

What welfare schemes?

During the February-2019 interim budget, Modi‚Äôs government introduced a pension programme for unorganised-sector workers called the Pradhan Mantri Shram Yogi Maandhan or the Prime Minister‚Äôs Labour Honorarium, which allowed those workers who earned less than Rs 15,000 a month a Rs-3,000 monthly pension after turning 60.

Among those eligible to register are street vendors, loaders, brick-kiln workers, landless labourers and domestic workers aged 18 to 40 years. Since the launch of the scheme, 5,966 workers registered in Delhi, as on May 26, according to the programme website.

The 2017-‚Äô18 National Sample Survey Office survey said that among regular-wage workers in the unorganised sector ‚Äì excluding the agricultural sector ‚Äì 54.2% were not eligible for paid leave, while 49.6% were not eligible for any social security benefits.

No worker we spoke to was aware of any government programme. ‚ÄúI have never heard of it,‚Äù said Suresh Koli, 52, a carpenter. ‚ÄúAll I know is that I need to fight a battle every day to have a meal at night.‚Äù

The consensus: government programmes are for the authorities that run them. Delhi‚Äôs ruling AAP created eight labour organisations in January 2019, to seek votes from the unorganised sector.

These labour organisations aimed to include workers in transportation, water, wholesale markets, construction, health, railways and electricity boards. Almost all the workers we spoke to in Sangam Vihar or Mahipalpur had heard to these labour bodies and expressed scepticism of the government.

Arun Jha, 43, a construction worker at Mahipalpur said in his 14 years on the job he had never heard of an organisation for labourers. Told of the AAP‚Äôs effort, he said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just for elections, nothing else.‚Äù

Back in Harola, when asked of expectations from the new Bharatiya Janata Party government, Raju, the worker we began this story with, referred to Modi‚Äôs 2014 promise of better days and said: ‚ÄúWe are in search of acche din [good days].‚Äù

Hard Times: Does the Modi government even understand what is going on with the Indian economy?,"In February, with the Lok Sabha elections just months away, Prime Minister Narendra Modi appeared at the ‚ÄúRising India‚Äù summit organised by media house News18 and took on critics who had accused his government of failing to deliver on promises to create millions of jobs.

‚ÄúIs it possible that with India growing at record rates, there are no jobs in the country?‚Äù

In lieu of actual jobs data, which Modi‚Äôs administration has both dismissed as being inaccurate and suppressed by refusing to release reports, the prime minister fell back on another economic indicator ‚Äì Gross Domestic Product growth ‚Äì to suggest that, somewhere out there in the Indian economy, some jobs must have been created.

Even at the time, the official GDP growth data was already under question, making Modi‚Äôs logic suspect. Economists had been arguing for some time that, under a new methodology that was put in place in 2015, official statistics are overestimating India‚Äôs GDP growth ‚Äì and so could not be used to presume anything about jobs.

Things fall apart

Soon after the elections, in which Modi won up a massive, historic return to power, the wheels started to come off.

First, Modi‚Äôs own former Chief Economic Adviser put out a paper arguing that the new methodology might be overestimating GDP growth by as much as 2.5 percentage points. Then leaders of business houses began speaking up about the malaise in the economy.

And finally, even the new GDP series ‚Äì the one that many experts believe is overestimating India‚Äôs growth rate ‚Äì started displaying a sharp decline.

When Modi first came to power, there were hopes that his government would put India onto a trajectory that would see double-digit growth rates. In the first quarter of Financial Year 2019-2020 (that is, April-June 2019), a full five years after Modi took charge in New Delhi, India‚Äôs GDP growth, under the new series, came down to 5%. Few expect India to grow faster than 6% this year. Double-digit growth now seems like a far-off dream.

Yet one thing about this situation remains extremely odd.

Despite the indications that the economy is in a deep funk ‚Äì a Non-Performing Asset-ridden banking sector to the waiting-to-blow-up real estate firms to suddenly debt-laden households ‚Äì Modi‚Äôs administration does not seem to be terribly perturbed.

$5 trillion pipe dream

In the aftermath of the election, the government used all of its propaganda channels to tell Indians that it was planning to turn the country into a $5 trillion economy by 2024 (up from $2.8 trillion now, a task that would require almost double digit growth every year until then).

Modi‚Äôs ministers, meanwhile, still seem to be insisting that there is no slowdown and that everything is fine. One minister dismissed questions about the growth rates required to reach that $5 trillion target, saying mathematics had never helped Einstein. Another insisted that the box-office success of three movies was proof that there is no slowdown.

What gives? Before May, many people believed the government‚Äôs bluster ‚Äì insisting that all was well with the economy and that India was poised for massive growth ‚Äì was simply pre-election propaganda.

Surely, this line of thinking went, they knew how bad things really were on the ground, but did not want to admit to weaknesses in the midst of an important re-election campaign. Indeed, attempts to suppress some data, particularly a report that revealed unemployment had hit a 45-year low in 2016-‚Äô17, and manipulate others, such as the back series of the new GDP methodology, suggested that it was more about controlling the narrative.

That the government also announced a huge income support scheme for farmers in its Februrary interim budget, which is usually kept free of major announcements, added to the impression that the all-is-well shtick was purely rhetoric, even as policymakers were actually trying to fix things behind the scenes.

‚ÄúBefore the election, especially because they were suppressing the labour force survey especially when they knew it was correct, I thought that this was all pre-election gimmickry,‚Äù said development economist Jayati Ghosh. ‚ÄúBut since then they have continued to do nothing.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor me it‚Äôs not about what they say, because they say very foolish things. It‚Äôs about what they‚Äôre doing or not doing. And the very fact that they‚Äôre not doing some really obvious measures, and they‚Äôre doing some wrong, irrelevant, and stupid measures suggests that they‚Äôre actually clueless, which is more terrifying in a way than thinking that they‚Äôre just cynical.‚Äù ‚Äî - Jayati Ghosh, development economist

Roll-back Budget

The June Budget demonstrates this perfectly. Since there was no change to the party in power, there was no question of quickly cobbling together a plan. Instead, it was expected to be a document that built on the interim Budget and the previous five years of economic policy, while setting the tone for Modi‚Äôs second term. The only difference was a new Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman.

By the time she had delivered her first Budget speech however, it was apparent both that the government was not going to acknowledge the precarious state of the Indian economy and that it did not have any grand vision to present other than pulling in as much revenue as possible (prompting Modi‚Äôs supporters to compare him to former prime minister Indira Gandhi).

In the months after, Sitharaman was left holding the bag on the economy, having to eventually roll back key measures announced in her budget and finally acknowledge that things were not going great (even as other ministers continued to talk about box-office numbers and Einstein).

Just before the festive season, Sitharaman finally announced what was supposed to be the big move that would turn the economy around: A massive corporate tax cut that initially brought cheer to the financial markets, even as experts questioned whether it would do anything to solve what was a demand slump.

But when the fine print emerged, the markets lost all their gains and doubts emerged about how many companies would actually take advantage of the cuts. In other words, industry and analysts are still waiting for word on whether the government ‚Äì now in the process of preparing next year‚Äôs Budget ‚Äì has a more potent economic weapon up its sleeve.

Key questions

These bumbling responses and the continued uncertainty brings up an important question. Does the Modi government not understand how bad things are? Or are we witnessing a government that has not yet come to terms with the fact that it cannot simply tame a downturn through political rhetoric, big-but-empty announcements and slapdash policy moves?

Is it the poor quality of economic advice available to Modi, who seems to have alienated many experts, or is it an unwillingness to accept that his first five years did not go as successfully as he would have Indians believe?

Because of how little is understood about Modi‚Äôs decision-making process ‚Äì we still don‚Äôt know whose idea demonetisation was, for example ‚Äì we may never get a straight answer for this.

So instead, over the next few days and in the coming weeks and months, we thought we would try to cut through the rhetoric and attempt to offer straightforward breakdowns of what is going on in the economy, starting with what now seems like a question with an obvious answer: Is India going through a slowdown?",https://scroll.in/article/942091/hard-times-does-the-modi-government-even-understand-what-is-going-on-with-the-indian-economy,
The Daily Fix: India doesn‚Äôt have enough jobs (or jobs data) ‚Äì and ‚ÄòPakodanomics‚Äô won‚Äôt fix that,"India does not have enough jobs. Or does it just not have enough jobs data? Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government would have you believe it is only the latter. ‚ÄúIf someone opens a ‚Äòpakoda‚Äô shop in front of your office, and he earns 200 rupees every day, does that not count at employment?‚Äù Modi asked in an interview in 2018, referring in Hindi to the deep-fried fritters sold street-side. ‚ÄúNow till me which register will capture this data?‚Äù

This argument, that Modi‚Äôs government has created the conditions for millions of people to be self-employed with the only problem being that officials statistics cannot take note of, has come to be known as ‚Äòpakodanomics.‚Äô On Tuesday, Railway Minister Piyush Goyal added to the discipline when asked about a recent report by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy that said unemployment was at a 27-month-high in December 2018 and that India had lost 11 million jobs over the course of that year.

Goyal‚Äôs response? Question the veracity of this data. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the CMIE gets its data from,‚Äù he said, adding that it was at ‚Äúcomplete variance‚Äù with the data that the government has collected. This stance is already problematic considering Modi has himself said that the government does not have adequate data.

But also, Goyal‚Äôs interpretation about variance seems inaccurate. A Business Standard report this week revealed that unemployment rose to a four-year high in 2016-17, according to the Employment-Unemployment Survey.

Moreover, this was the last Employment-Unemployment report on jobs available, meaning the CMIE data concurred with the trend shown by current government statistics on increase in unemployment. That report has been discontinued, with the government instituting a Periodic Labour Force Survey in its stead. But the data from that survey for 2017-18 has yet to come and few expect it to be available before the 2019 elections.

Another report released by the Centre for Sustainable Employment of the Azim Premji University also said that the rate of unemployment in 2015 alone was the highest it has been in the last 20 years. Most indicators, indeed, seem to say the same thing: India is not creating enough jobs, a sentiment that was echoed by no less than Union Minister Nitin Gadkari last week.



This of course, does not mean that lndia has great jobs data. A committee has recommended changes to the way India measures employment, citing lapses in previous approaches. And no less than the Chief Statistician of India Pravin Srivastava said last year that newer data Modi has been citing to claim healthy job numbers, from the Employment Provident Fund Organisation, should not be used as a proxy for employment generation.

In other words, it seems likely that India does not have enough jobs and it is clear that the country also does not have robust enough job data. Fixing both will have to be the priority of whoever wins the next election. But this conclusion also brings up an important question: For a government that came into power promising to create a massive number of new jobs, how come it only discovered in its final year that the jobs data is inadequate?

"Rahul Gandhi mocks Modi over unemployment data, says ‚ÄòFuhrer‚Äô promised 2 crore jobs a year","Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Thursday mocked Prime Minister Narendra Modi after unreleased data on unemployment was made public. A report in Business Standard has said that the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey recorded the unemployment rate in India at a 45-year-high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18.

‚ÄúThe Fuhrer promised us 2 crore jobs a year,‚Äù Gandhi tweeted. ‚ÄúFive years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a national disaster.‚Äù The Fuhrer was a political title used for German dictator and Nazi Party chief Adolf Hitler.

‚ÄúUnemployment is the highest in 45 years,‚Äù Gandhi said. ‚Äú6.5 crore youth were jobless in 2017-‚Äô18 alone. Time for NoMo2Go.‚Äù

Two independent members of the National Statistical Commission had resigned this week after the government allegedly failed to publish the report that was prepared last month. The report has still not been made public.

The survey is the first on employment made by a government agency since demonetisation. The Periodic Labour Force Survey is also the first annual household survey of the National Sample Survey Office. Its data was collected between July 2017 and June 2018.

Documents reviewed by the Business Standard showed that unemployment rate was at its highest since the 1972-‚Äô73 period, from when the employment data is comparable. In comparison, the unemployment rate stood at 2.2% in 2011-‚Äô12, during the United Progressive Alliance‚Äôs second term, according to the survey.",https://scroll.in/latest/911528/rahul-gandhi-mocks-modi-over-unemployment-data-says-fuhrer-promised-2-crore-jobs-a-year,
"Employment: Government does not want to accept that there is a crisis, claims Rahul Gandhi","Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that the Narendra Modi-led government ‚Äúdid not want to accept‚Äù there was a ‚Äújob crisis‚Äù in the country, and urged the Prime Minister to hold discussions with the youth to address the matter. ‚ÄúYoungsters of this country are the ones who are actually capable of moving it towards progress,‚Äù he said.

During an interaction with students of Delhi University at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in the capital, Gandhi said the state must pay for a large part of education of students, PTI reported.

The Congress chief said he was ‚Äúabsolutely convinced‚Äù that India could overtake China‚Äôs economy. ‚ÄúIn a county of over 1.2 billion people, India is creating about 450 jobs per 24 hours while China is creating 50,000 jobs in the same 24 hours,‚Äù said Gandhi, citing figures given by the Ministry of Finance to the Lok Sabha.

‚ÄúOur current government does not even want to accept that there is an employment crisis,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúWe need to first acknowledge that there is a problem, and then we need to galvanise support to fight it. That is what we [Congress] believe in.‚Äù

Gandhi said he had already challenged Modi to debate with him on the Rafale fighter jet deal, corruption, unemployment and other issues. ‚ÄúThe prime minister should not be telling his views to the youth, but listen to their voices,‚Äù he added.

Data from a leaked report of the National Sample Survey Office showed that unemployment in India was at a 45-year-high of 6.1% in 2017-‚Äô18.

Meanwhile, Gandhi said the Congress would provide the status of ‚Äúmartyr‚Äù to those paramilitary jawans killed in the line of duty if the party is voted to power in the upcoming Lok Sabha election.

‚ÄúParamilitary forces don‚Äôt get martyr‚Äôs status when they lay down their lives,‚Äù the Hindustan Times quoted him as saying. ‚ÄúIf we form the government, we will give the status of martyrs to those paramilitary soldiers who lay down their lives in the line of duty.‚Äù

At least 40 Central Reserve Police Force jawans were killed when a suicide bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle into a convoy in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14. Earlier this week, Gandhi had met the family of one of the CRPF jawans in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Shamli district.

‚ÄúWhile talking to the families of martyrs, I knew what it felt like to be where they were,‚Äù Gandhi said. ‚ÄúMy father, too, was blown to pieces and my grandmother was shot with 32 bullets.‚Äù

Gandhi alleged that a lack of jobs was leading to anger among the citizens. ‚ÄúIn my journey to Shamli, I interacted with many youngsters, and many stated that they are not employed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe should solve the employment crisis to remove anger in the society.‚Äù

"Narendra Modi destroyed India‚Äôs global image, is responsible for declining jobs: Rahul Gandhi","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for rising unemployment in the country and said he was responsible for destroying India‚Äôs image abroad, PTI reported.

Addressing a youth rally in Rajasthan‚Äôs capital Jaipur, Gandhi claimed the prime minister had promised to create two crore jobs but instead, one crore people had lost employment last year. ‚ÄúWherever the prime minister goes he talks of Citizenship Amendment Act, National Population Register but the biggest issue of unemployment is not mentioned, the prime minister doesn‚Äôt even speak a word on it,‚Äù he was quoted as saying by ANI.

Gandhi pointed out that economic growth has dropped since the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power. ‚ÄúIndia grew at 9% during the UPA [government‚Äôs rule],‚Äù the MP from Wayanad said. ‚ÄúThe entire world was looking towards us. Today, you have different parameters to measure GDP and you have a 5% rate. If you use old parameters, then India is growing at 2.5%.‚Äù

He referred to the 2016 demonetisation exercise and said even an eight-year-old child would say the note ban did more harm than good. ‚ÄúEarlier, we were competing with China but now sadly China has left us far behind,‚Äù Gandhi claimed.

He said the youth of the country were ‚Äúanswered with bullets and suppressed‚Äù when they asked questions about unemployment. ‚ÄúThe reputation and image that India had in the world were that it is a country of brotherhood, love and unity, while Pakistan was known for hatred and divisiveness,‚Äù Gandhi added. ‚ÄúThis image of India has been damaged by Narendra Modi. Today, India is considered as the rape capital of the world.‚Äù

Gandhi challenged Modi to visit any university in the country and answer the questions raised by the youth. ‚ÄúThese questions are related to unemployment, dividing the country, spoiling the image of the country,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe prime minister will not be able to answer, he can only make false promises.‚Äù

On Monday, Gandhi tweeted in Hindi: ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt be scared of my questions finance minister. I am asking these questions on behalf of the youth of this country, and it‚Äôs your responsibility to answer them. The youth need employment, but the government has failed miserably in giving employment to them.‚Äù He also used the hashtag #JawabDoMantriJi (answer, minister).

Gandhi shared a newspaper clipping in which Sitharaman took a swipe at him, as she had not shared employment figures. In the article, Sitharaman had said that if she gave out employment numbers, Gandhi might question her a few months later, the Hindustan Times reported. ‚ÄúI would wait for a few months before giving any number,‚Äù she said in the report.

On Sunday, Gandhi tweeted a video of the prime minister doing yoga, and wrote: ‚ÄúPlease try your magical exercise routine a few more times. You never know, it might just start the economy‚Äù.

The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy had said in November that India‚Äôs unemployment rate in October rose to 8.48% ‚Äì the highest since August 2016.

Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs ‚Äòdanda‚Äô barb at Modi may actually have inflicted a grievous wound on the Congress,"Rahul Gandhi may have possibly driven the last nail in the Congress party‚Äôs coffin with his remark during a speech last week that India‚Äôs youth will attack Prime Minister Narendra Modi with sticks if he fails to resolve the unemployment crisis. This was a reprehensible statement ‚Äì almost as low as those made by some Bharatiya Janata Party luminaries in the run-up to the Delhi elections. More importantly, it was a reckless remark that is bound to tarnish the Congress‚Äôs image as a responsible political party.

In the light of the party‚Äôs abysmal performance in the 2014 and 2019 parliamentary elections, this statement could even be considered to have irreparably damaged its national ambitions. Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs mother, Sonia, led the party to an unprecedented defeat in the national elections in 2014. Rahul Gandhi did the same in 2019. The only thing that saved the party from an even worse outcome was the performance of the party‚Äôs Punjab and Kerala units, no thanks to Rahul Gandhi, and the fact that it bagged several seats in Tamil Nadu by hanging on to the coat-tails of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.

A terrible liability

Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs lack of charisma, imagination and organising capabilities when combined with his repeated faux pas have clearly made him a liability for the Congress. These qualities, combined with an aversion to the dynasty‚Äôs control of the party, have turned off many potential voters. The dynasty, more particularly Rahul Gandhi, have now become very potent sticks for the BJP to beat the Congress with.

It is now obvious that when Modi refers to Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs statements, he does not refer to the Congress MP by name. This is a deliberate attempt to convey to the public the low esteem in which Modi holds Gandhi ‚Äì and by implication the dynasty. Gandhi‚Äôs consistently uninspiring and counterproductive statements play into Modi‚Äôs hands.

The Congress‚Äôs decision to persevere with the dynasty is a reflection of the party leadership‚Äôs sycophantic culture and lack of political imagination. Replacing Rahul Gandhi with Sonia Gandhi and now, as rumours have it, bringing back Rahul Gandhi as president of the party provides fodder for satire. It is time that the party leadership decides to remove the dynasty from power.

However, such an action would require the reinstatement of inner party democracy in the party and a total overhaul of the unelected and unelectable members of the Congress Working Committee. This appears to be a tall order at the moment but it is the only way to resuscitate India‚Äôs Grand Old Party.

Gandhi said the prime minister did ‚Äúnot have the guts‚Äù to do so.

‚ÄúNarendra Modi should stand up and have the courage to speak to the youngsters of these universities on why the economy has become a disaster, why has it become a basket case and why unemployment in India is at its highest in 50 years,‚Äù Rahul Gandhi told reporters after a meeting of Opposition leaders in New Delhi. ‚ÄúI challenge the prime minister to go to any of the universities, stand over there without his police, without his infrastructure and tell the people what is he going to do with this country.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, the prime minister of the country does not have the guts to do this,‚Äù the former Congress president said.

Gandhi accused Modi was pursuing a policy of ‚Äúdistract and divide‚Äù, which he said was the ‚Äúbiggest disservice to the nation‚Äù. He alleged that since the prime minister is afraid of having a dialogue with the students, he is crushing them using the police.

Earlier in the day, Congress President Sonia Gandhi said the government had ‚Äúlet loose a reign of oppression, spreading hatred and trying to divide our people along sectarian lines‚Äù. She said there was unprecedented turmoil as Constitution was being undermined and instruments of governance were being misused.

She added that the response of the police to student protests in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi had been ‚Äúshockingly partisan and brutal‚Äù.

Buses were set on fire, and several students and police officers were injured. The police were accused of using excessive force and even assaulting students. Police also entered the Aligarh Muslim University campus the same evening after a clash broke out between them and students. They baton-charged students and used tear gas shells on them.

"In Germany, Rahul Gandhi blames unemployment for mob lynchings","Congress President Rahul Gandhi said on Wednesday that incidents of mob lynching in India were the result of unemployment and ‚Äúdestruction‚Äù of small businesses due to demonetisation, and the poor implementation of the Goods and Services Tax. Gandhi was addressing a gathering at Bucerius Summer School in Hamburg, Germany.

He claimed that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had taken away protections from marginalised castes and communities, PTI reported. ‚ÄúThey feel that tribal communities, poor farmers, lower caste people, minorities shouldn‚Äôt get the same benefits as the elite,‚Äù he alleged.

The Congress president said India began to break the shackles of caste as it transitioned from a rural to an urban country, and successive governments supported the people by putting in place certain protections as it was felt the transformation would pose risks to Dalits, oppressed castes, Adivasis and minorities. However, the Narendra Modi-led government has failed to follow this path, Gandhi said.

Gandhi said the real risk of excluding people from development is ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt give people a vision in the 21st century, somebody else will give them one‚Äù.

Gandhi said that some of his own party members had not liked it when he hugged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Parliament last month, PTI reported.

He also said he was unhappy to learn about the killing of Prabhakaran, whose outfit Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam was responsible for the assassination of his father Rajiv Gandhi in 1991. Sri Lankan troops shot Prabhakaran dead in 2009.

‚ÄúWhen I saw the man who killed my father lying dead in a field in Sri Lanka, I did not like it, I saw his crying children in him,‚Äù Gandhi said.

Citing the examples of the assassinations of his father and grandmother Indira Gandhi, he said the only way to move forward after violence is forgiveness. ‚ÄúThere is no other way,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd to forgive you have to understand what exactly happened and why it happened.‚Äù

Gandhi claimed that the United States, when it invaded Iraq in 2003, stopped the Tikriti tribe from getting employment in the new government and the Army, The Indian Express reported. ‚ÄúAnd you got an insurgency that fought the US and caused massive casualties to the Americans,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat insurgency then slowly entered the empty spaces in Iraq and Syria. And then it connected with the global internet to form the horrific idea called the Islamic State group.‚Äù

India‚Äôs foreign policy

The Congress leader said that playing a balancing role between the United States and China should be one of India‚Äôs major foreign policy goals. ‚ÄúIndia has deep relations with the US,‚Äùhe said, according to the Hindustan Times. ‚ÄúBut India can‚Äôt ignore the fact that China is growing extremely fast and we need to balance our position. I think there are certain values India brings to the table. So, India and Europe‚Äôs role would be to balance the narrative.‚Äù",https://scroll.in/latest/891512/in-germany-rahul-gandhi-blames-unemployment-for-mob-lynchings,
"Unemployment, intolerance hindering India‚Äôs growth, Rahul Gandhi tells political experts in the US","Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi said that unemployment and intolerance were the main issues that were hindering India‚Äôs development. During a meeting with United States Chamber of Commerce President Thomas J Donohue on Monday, Gandhi expressed his worries over the government‚Äôs inability to create jobs in India.

The Congress leader is on a two-week-long tour in the country, which he kicked off with an address at the University of California in Berkeley last week. On Tuesday, Gandhi will address students of the Princeton University in New Jersey.

Gandhi has met many Indian and South Asian experts and the head of the South Asia division at the National Security Council of the White House Lisa Curtis during a series of meetings on Monday. Curtis reportedly sought his views on the US-India relationship and Donald Trump‚Äôs policy on Afghanistan.

Exclusive: India's urban unemployment rate slows in March quarter - government data,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs urban unemployment rate between January and March this year fell to 9.3%, the lowest in at least four quarters, according to an unpublished government report reviewed by Reuters.

The numbers, recorded in the statistics ministry‚Äôs quarterly jobs report, could provide some relief to Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has faced criticism for not being able to create enough jobs amid slowing economic growth.

The urban unemployment rate of the January-March quarter compared with 9.9% in the preceding quarter. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter‚Äôs rate is the lowest since then.

The report, which is likely to be published soon, did not assess rural unemployment.

The estimates were arrived at using the so-called ‚Äúcurrent weekly status‚Äù method which gives an average picture of unemployment in a short period of seven days preceding the survey period, the document said. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.

Joblessness among the youth - those aged between 15-29 years and who account for roughly over a third of India‚Äôs 1.3 billion people - was also marginally lower at 22.5% in the quarter ending March 2019, from 23.7% in the preceding quarter.

The Indian government has in recent years faced public ire for not releasing comprehensive jobs data regularly.

The first extensive annual report for the July 2017-June 2018 period, leaked in February and published in the Business Standard newspaper, showed unemployment rate was the highest in at least 45 years. Modi‚Äôs government officially released the report in May.

That month, the statistics department also released one set of quarterly urban unemployment reports that revealed data for April to December 2018. The latest report, reviewed by Reuters, contains jobs assessment for the first quarter of this year.

The fall in the unemployment rate, by weekly status methodology basis, came as employment among regular wage employees and a section of self-employed workers increased during the period, the statistics ministry report showed.

Still, the labour force participation rate - the percentage of population making up the labour force - which had slowly edged up between April and December last year, recorded a dip to 36% during the March quarter, the report showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia‚Äôs third largest economy.

India‚Äôs economic growth fell to an over four-year low of 5.8% in the January-March period. Subsequently, it fell further to 5% in the following quarter.",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-jobs/exclusive-indias-urban-unemployment-rate-slows-in-march-quarter-government-data-idINKBN1XX032,

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, the highest since August 2016, and up from 7.2% in September, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE)on Friday, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

Modi faces 'jobs crisis' as unemployment hits 6.1%,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 6.1% in the 2017/18 fiscal year, the statistics ministry said on Friday, presenting a challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to kick-start job creation in his second term in office.

Job seekers attend a job fair organised by the employment department of the Delhi state government in New Delhi, India, January 21, 2019. Picture taken January 21, 2019. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis

The data, that has been repeatedly delayed, was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn in for his second term. Indian voters gave him a big mandate in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

‚ÄúIt shows the jobs crisis is still there: there are not many new ones being created,‚Äù said NR Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi, regarding the new figure.

Pronab Sen, India‚Äôs former chief statistician, said that small businesses had been especially weak, while the unemployment rate was likely to have spiked after the country replaced the majority of its banknotes in a shock move in 2016.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8% in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China‚Äôs pace for the first time in nearly two years.

The 6.1% figure matches data earlier leaked to the Business Standard newspaper in January, that said it was the highest level in at least 45 years.

The paper‚Äôs report was based on an assessment carried out by the National Sample Survey Office between July 2017 and June 2018.

There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several years, and on Friday the government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a new design, new metric,‚Äù chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters. He did not elaborate.

‚ÄúIt would be unfair to compare it with the past.‚Äù

The data also showed the continuing gender imbalance in the Indian workforce, that has one of the lowest female participation rates in the world.

The statistics ministry said that the female labour participation rate in urban areas for the quarter ending December 2018 was 19.5%, compared with 73.6% for males.

‚ÄúIt is a long-term issue, to do with social, cultural and religious reasons,‚Äù Bhanumurthy said. ‚ÄúAny solution needs to come from the ground to tackle these.‚Äù",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-jobs/modi-faces-jobs-crisis-as-unemployment-hits-6-1-idINKCN1T11HQ,
"Indian jobless rate at multi-decade high, report says, in blow to Modi","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - An official survey that has been withheld by the government shows India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18, the Business Standard newspaper reported on Thursday, delivering a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi months before a general election.

FILE PHOTO: A daily wage worker waits for employment in front of closed shops at a market in the southern Indian city of Bengaluru, previously known as Bangalore, January 12, 2015. REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa

A political controversy over the survey erupted after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the jobs data resigned, saying there had been a delay in its scheduled December release and alleging interference by other state agencies.

The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), conducted July 2017-June 2018, showed an unemployment rate of 6.1 percent. That was the highest since 1972/73, the period for which the data are comparable, the newspaper reported, citing documents it had reviewed. It did not give a figure for 1972/73.

But the government think-tank NITI Aayog said the report was only a draft and that a final version would be published in March. It denied unemployment was widespread in India, whose economy is one of the fastest growing in the world.

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be growing annually at 7.2 percent and saying that there are no jobs being created in the economy,‚Äù NITI Aayog Chief Executive Amitabh Kant said at a press conference.

‚ÄúTo my mind, the problem is that there‚Äôs a lack of good-quality jobs, and that‚Äôs what we need to focus on. There‚Äôs a wages problem, and there‚Äôs a very big informal sector in India‚Äôs economy.‚Äù

He said the country was creating more than 7 million jobs a year, enough for ‚Äúnew entrants‚Äù joining the workforce.

Rahul Gandhi, the leader of the Congress party, the main opposition, said the report showed ‚Äúa national disaster‚Äù.

Though India‚Äôs economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually, uneven growth has meant that new jobs are not keeping pace. And critics say the government‚Äôs claims of economic success have sounded increasingly hollow.

Modi‚Äôs ambitious Make-in-India project has failed to take off. It was intended to increase the share of domestic manufacturing from 17 percent of gross domestic product to about 25 percent and create jobs for an estimated 1.2 million youth entering the market each month.

Instead, the report showed 18.7 percent of urban males aged 15-29 were without work, and the jobless rate for urban females the same age was 27.2 percent.

Worse, the labor force participation rate - the proportion of population working or seeking jobs - declined to 36.9 percent in 2017/18 from 39.5 percent in 2011/12, the report said. The comparable rate for the United States was 63.1 percent in December.

The NITI Aayog said the government needed more quarterly data to publish a ‚Äúcomparable‚Äù jobs report.

But P.C. Mohanan, who on Monday resigned as the head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission, said the standalone report for the last fiscal year should have been published.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no link between this and the quarterly data,‚Äù Mohanan told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis report was released for approval because this is a standalone report and it does not require any additional verification with any sources.‚Äù

CRISIS EVERYWHERE

Himanshu, an associate professor at New Delhi‚Äôs Jawaharlal Nehru University who specializes in development economics, said that the jobs crisis was everywhere to see.

‚ÄúNews and data like thousands of PhDs applying for waiter jobs in Mumbai or millions applying for just a thousand jobs in Gujarat or 10 million applying for a small number of jobs in railways,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúI mean, these kind of examples are everywhere,‚Äù he said, pointing to street protests by caste and other interest groups seeking quotas for government jobs.

The data provides the first comprehensive assessment of India‚Äôs employment since Modi‚Äôs decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country‚Äôs banknotes from circulation overnight.

After the chaotic launch of a national sales tax in July 2017, hundreds of thousands have lost jobs in small businesses.

The gloomy jobs data could be awkward for Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist government to explain with a general election looming and opinion polls already showing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party unlikely to keep its parliamentary majority.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a very, very serious issue, and that is the why the government didn‚Äôt want this data to come out in the public domain,‚Äù said former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha.

A report released by the All India Manufacturers‚Äô Organisation said last month 3.5 million jobs had been lost since 2016, mainly due to demonetization and rising working costs after the launch of the national tax.",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-economy-jobs/indian-jobless-rate-at-multi-decade-high-report-says-in-blow-to-modi-idINKCN1PP0FX,
India's February jobless rate climbed to 7.2 percent: CMIE,"Job seekers attend a job fair organised by the employment department of the Delhi state government in New Delhi, India, January 21, 2019. REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The unemployment rate in India rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, the highest since September 2016, and up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) that was released on Tuesday.

The unemployment rate has climbed despite a fall in the number of job seekers, Mahesh Vyas, head of the Mumbai-based think tank told Reuters, citing an estimated fall in the labour force participation rate. The number of employed persons in India was estimated at 400 million in February compared with 406 million a year ago, he said.

The CMIE numbers are based on a survey of tens of thousands of households across India. The figures are regarded by many economists as more credible than the jobless data produced by the government.

The figures will be unwelcome news for Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of a general election due to be held by early May. Concerns about weak farm prices and low jobs growth are often brought up as election issues by opposition parties.

When the government has released official data for the jobless rate in the past it has tended to be out-of-date. But recently it withheld a batch of data because officials said they needed to check its veracity.

The figures that were withheld in December were leaked to a local newspaper a few weeks ago, and showed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18.

A CMIE report released in January said nearly 11 million people lost jobs in 2018 after the demonetisation of high value notes in late 2016 and the chaotic launch of a new goods and services tax in 2017, hit millions of small businesses.

The government told Parliament last month that it did not have data on the impact of demonetisation on jobs in small businesses.",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-jobs/indias-february-jobless-rate-climbed-to-72-percent-cmie-idINKCN1QM1NT,
Modi's big tax cut unlikely to spur job bonanza in India,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - With one eye on flagging demand, businesses in India are likely to bank the government‚Äôs $20.4 billion corporate tax windfall rather than unleash the investments that Prime Minister Narendra Modi hopes will create millions of jobs and revive the economy.

The tax cuts, which Modi vowed would woo global private investment and improve India‚Äôs competitiveness, came as a surprise to investors, many of whom had been complaining that Modi‚Äôs government was not listening to their pleas for action on the economy.

But while the tax rate cut brings the cost of doing business in India into line with its main Asian rivals, the government giveaway will do little to fix the lack of spending power, economists say.

GDP fizzled to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and India‚Äôs unemployment rate reached 8.19% in August, up from 6.27% in the same month last year, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

Modi is counting on companies to quickly relocate or expand and hire but many businesses will need the cash just to tide them over and won‚Äôt want to take a risk when demand for everything from cars to biscuits has been hit.

‚ÄúHopefully this tax cut will give companies a bit more financial space to maintain operations. For the moment I think this is more about job-saving, not job-creating,‚Äù said Richard Rossow, an India expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Economists and finance ministry officials expect India‚Äôs spending plans to mean it will miss its fiscal deficit target this year and be pushed to borrow. That will pile stress on state finances and make any boost in infrastructure spending, which can be a source of quick employment for rural migrants, unlikely.

Although broadly welcomed by businesses, electronics manufacturers are so far among the few to indicate the tax cuts would be enough to trigger investment as they seek to hedge their bets amid the China-U.S. trade war.

‚ÄúThe psychological stimulus from this ‚ÄòNew Deal‚Äô will be higher than the fiscal stimulus,‚Äù said V.K. Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist with Geojit Financial Services.

‚ÄúWHY ARE COMPANIES SHUTTING DOWN?‚Äù

With an estimated 1.2 million youth entering India‚Äôs labour market each month, Modi has made job creation a priority in his ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô plan, but manufacturing has been sluggish.

India‚Äôs auto sector has laid off about 350,000 workers this year, while Parle Products, a major Indian biscuit maker, recently warned it may shed some 10,000 workers.

Jewellery designer Shaji Balan said he was laid off in June after his employers sold their factory. The father of three secured another job, but it pays half of what he used to earn, so he has joined the gig economy delivering food for online service Swiggy.

‚ÄúToo many people are jobless. Why are companies shutting down?‚Äù said Balan.

Although markets surged after the tax announcement on Friday they have already given back some gains, with investors waiting to see if there is more to come.

‚ÄúFurther structural reforms to the labour market, land acquisition and regulatory environment,‚Äù would help generate sustainable growth, said Arnab Das, global market strategist at Invesco in London.

Economists and business leaders who see low wages and depressed crop prices as playing big parts in India‚Äôs economic slowdown would have preferred measures to stimulate consumption.

The tax cut ‚Äúis a welcome move by the government,‚Äù said Mayank Shah, category head at biscuit maker Parle, but he added that a goods and services tax (GST) cut to reduce prices for consumers would have had a more significant impact.

At least some of the unemployment growth, business leaders say, is tied to two of Modi‚Äôs major economic reforms from his first term - demonetisation to tackle unaccounted wealth and the nationwide rollout of a goods and services tax - both of which caused short-term pain with the promise of long-term gain.

India‚Äôs economic woes have not yet dented Modi‚Äôs popularity. He won a sweeping mandate in May‚Äôs general election despite worries over jobs.

Delivery of basic public services, like toilets or cooking gas, as well as recent steps curtailing restive Kashmir‚Äôs autonomy have resonated with Modi‚Äôs base, according to Rossow of CSIS.

India‚Äôs 2019/20 planned gross borrowings were already the highest in at least nine years, and with the latest measures are expected to increase further.

However, India is not thinking of revising its fiscal deficit target in the near future and isn‚Äôt thinking of spending cuts either, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

But bond yields have already spiked and economists doubt India can maintain its fiscal deficit target, which stands at 3.3% of GDP for the current financial year.

‚ÄúCompanies‚Äô gains are the government‚Äôs losses,‚Äù Nomura said in a note to clients, adding it did not expect any ‚Äúmeaningful‚Äù impact on economic growth in the short-term. ‚ÄúHowever, this is a medium-term positive step.‚Äù",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-jobs/modis-big-tax-cut-unlikely-to-spur-job-bonanza-in-india-idINKBN1WA1J8,

Six months on, the 27-year-old repairs mixer-grinders, table fans and other household appliances at a cramped shop in the western city of Pune. On better days, he picks up broken LED lights from scrap dealers, fixes them, then sells them. He earns about $50 a month, just enough to cover the rent for the room he shares with two others as his home.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt even started repaying my education loan,‚Äù said Gurav, referring to the nearly $4,000 he‚Äôd borrowed for his undergraduate study.

He is one of hundreds of thousands of engineers - studying everything from computer code to civil engineering - that India‚Äôs education system churns out each year, many with large loans and little prospect of finding a job in their field.

They highlight Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs difficulty in fulfilling a promise he made weeks after coming to power in 2014: creating millions of jobs by boosting manufacturing under a flagship ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô project launched with much fanfare.

‚ÄúCome, Make in India, we will say to the world, from electrical to electronics,‚Äù Modi said in his maiden Independence Day speech as prime minister, pledging to create up to 100 million new jobs by 2022.

NO ECHOES OF CHINA BOOM

Four years on, the programme‚Äôs impact on job creation is unclear and growth in the manufacturing sector has been sluggish, partly due to a lack of land and labour reform.

India‚Äôs unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent last month, up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) think tank. The figures are more recent than government data and many economists regard them as more credible.

The data, which is an estimate based on household surveys, shows 31.2 million people were actively looking for jobs in February this year, said Mahesh Vyas, the CMIE managing director. It did not have a breakup for engineering or technology graduates.

With more than half of India‚Äôs population under 25 years of age, critics say the votes of jobless youth could hurt Modi‚Äôs chances of securing a second term in the upcoming general election to be held in April-May.

The increasing use of automation in industry, the massive number of young Indians coming onto the job market, and the regulatory hurdles that companies still face if they want to set up shop in India, are all big issues for those without work.

The manufacturing boom that helped China in the past 40 years will not wash up on India‚Äôs shores. Companies can no longer afford to just rely on cheap labour: they need skilled labour and better infrastructure to drive technological innovations and increase productivity.

Employers often complain about the lack of skilled engineering and technology graduates, said Varun Aggarwal, an electrical engineer and co-founder of the skills assessment firm Aspiring Minds. Its surveys show over 80 percent of the engineers India produces are not employable. The employability has not improved in seven years, Aggarwal said.

‚ÄúThe numbers have just not budged,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúMany can‚Äôt even write basic code.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe need to start there, at the beginning of the education system,‚Äù said Aggarwal.

The IT industry had long been seen as a gateway to the middle class in India, but a move to robotics and artificial intelligence has replaced some positions. The business process outsourcing industry ‚Äì seen as a stable provider of ‚Äúoffshore‚Äù jobs ‚Äì added the least number of employees in seven years in 2017-18 (April-March), according to the trade body Nasscom.

LACK ENGLISH SKILLS

At a recent job fair organised by a college in the town of Chinchwad in western India, Gurav was among hundreds queued up to apply, including dozens of engineers, even though most companies were hiring for marketing and finance positions.

Many came from rural areas where they studied in regional languages, and lacked strong English skills ‚Äì another gap that recruiters say India‚Äôs education system needs to address.

Ankush Karwade, 22, who travelled 80 miles (130 km) to reach the fair, said his father was a farmer and the family couldn‚Äôt fund him to earn an undergraduate degree. He did a shorter and cheaper diploma course in engineering.

‚ÄúI watch some English movies and read the newspapers to improve, but most employers want graduates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThey (also) want English speaking skills, which I don‚Äôt have.‚Äù

Gayatri, a 24-year-old woman who goes by one name, gained a master‚Äôs degree in engineering four months ago, under pressure from her parents. She said she had wanted to continue her education in Indian classical music.

‚ÄúMy father wanted me to do engineering, so I did it. Now there are no jobs,‚Äù she said. A company at the fair offered her a customer service position that would pay about $140 a month.

‚ÄúCan you believe it?‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt get this degree to sit at a call centre.‚Äù

Jobless engineers are not a new problem and ‚Äúminiscule‚Äù in comparison to the millions of farmers dissatisfied over weak crop prices, said Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at the Jawaharlal Nehru University who also uses one name.

Still, they represent a lot of untapped potential.

Fixing household appliances is not what Gurav expected to do as a graduate. ‚ÄúI could find work at a call centre, but it‚Äôs not what I want to do,‚Äù he said. He may soon be forced to reconsider though as his father is due to retire next year and the family will need the money.

For now, Gurav plans to continue to do the repairwork ‚Äì but is too ashamed to tell his friends about it, he said, and refused to be photographed at the shop.

"India's economic growth slows, pressure on Modi to speed up reforms","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs annual economic growth slowed to 4.5% in the July-September quarter, its weakest pace since 2013, putting pressure on Prime Minister Narendra Modi to speed up reforms as five rate cuts by the central bank have failed to boost investments.

Economists said the drop in growth could prompt the Reserve Bank of India to cut its repo rate INREPO=ECI by 25 basis points to 4.90% at its meeting next week, although investors are skeptical about how effective monetary policy can be in boosting growth in the current scenario.

The gross domestic product data INGDPQ=ECI released on Friday showed consumer demand, private investment and exports all struggling.

The year-on-year growth figure was below the 4.7% forecast in a Reuters poll of economists and compared with 7% growth in the same quarter of 2018, and 5% in the previous quarter.

Modi‚Äôs government, given a second term by voters in May, has taken several steps including cutting corporate tax in September and speeding up privatization of state-run firms to boost investments and bolster growth.

India needs to grow at around 8% a year to create enough jobs for the millions of young people joining the labor force each year, yet many economists see the current slowdown continuing for another year or two, underlining the case for urgent reforms.

‚ÄúAt this point in time, direct fiscal intervention and/or cut in personal income tax rates to put in more money in the hand of consumers appears to be the only short-term solution,‚Äù said Kunal Kundu, India economist, Societe Generale, Bangalore.

However he said the government had limited room to maneuver as the fiscal deficit crossed the full-year target in the seven months to October.

If the RBI does cut rates, it would the sixth consecutive policy meeting that it has done so. The repo rate has fallen 135 basis points so far this year but banks, saddled with about $140 billion in stressed assets, have not cut their lending rates much.

The government is nudging the central bank to set up a fund to buy out stressed assets of the country‚Äôs top 25 shadow lenders and revive the financial sector, a government source told reporters on Thursday.

Modi is pushing in parliament for labor reforms as well as measures to offer more incentives to attract foreign investors to set up factories in India.

Firms show little appetite to invest due to sluggish domestic and global demand.

‚ÄòECONOMIC EMERGENCY‚Äô

In a heated parliamentary debate on the economic slowdown affecting jobs, opposition parties said earlier this week that millions of people had lost their jobs and the country faced an ‚Äúeconomic emergency‚Äù.

Reacting to Friday‚Äôs economic data, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the sharp fall in economic growth was ‚Äúunacceptable‚Äù given the country‚Äôs aspiration to grow at 8-9% a year.

Economists said that with persistently tight domestic credit and weak corporate profits, India‚Äôs recovery could be delayed and the pick-up would remain below potential.

The unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, its highest since August 2016, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data released earlier this month, though the government estimates that urban unemployment declined.

Government and central bank officials are not sure whether the economic slump has bottomed out as growth slipped for sixth straight quarter.

Many indicators ‚Äì automobile sales, rail freight, petroleum product consumption, domestic air traffic and imports - are signaling weak domestic consumption.

In the September quarter, private investment grew 5%, up from 3.1% in the previous quarter, while government spending rose 15.6% from 8.8%.

However, capital investment growth slipped to 1% from 4%, indicating that despite rate cuts firms are putting investment on hold, while agriculture grew modestly and manufacturing contracted by 1.0%.

India‚Äôs infrastructure output ININFR=ECI contracted for the second consecutive month to 5.8% in October from a year earlier, the lowest since at least April 2012, separate data released on Friday showed.

‚ÄúWhile it appears likely that the growth rate has bottomed out especially as the favorable base effect kicks in, extremely weak demand conditions engender a lurking fear of continued weakness in economic activity,‚Äù said Kundu, the Societe Generale economist.",https://in.reuters.com/article/us-india-economy-gdp/indias-economic-growth-slows-pressure-on-modi-to-speed-up-reforms-idINKBN1Y31N1,

Five million lost jobs in India between 2016 and 2018: report,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - At least five million Indians lost their jobs between 2016 and 2018, and young urban men are being hit hardest, a Bengaluru-based private university said in a report on Tuesday.

The report by the Azim Premji University comes as Indians are voting in a staggered general election, which is due to end on May 19, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government keen to defend its economic record, including on jobs.

‚ÄúIn addition to rising open unemployment among the higher educated, the less educated (and likely informal) workers have also seen job losses and reduced work opportunities since 2016,‚Äù said Amit Basole, an economist and lead author of the report.

The report did not say how many jobs were created during the period.

Modi‚Äôs abrupt withdrawal of high value currency notes from circulation in November 2016, with the aim of curbing tax evasion and promoting digital transactions, disrupted small businesses and sparked layoffs.

The introduction of a national sales tax the following year compounded difficulties for some businesses.

The unemployed were mostly higher educated and young people, in the 20-24 age range, according to the study titled ‚ÄúState of Working India 2019‚Äù.

‚ÄúAmong urban men, for example, this age group accounts for 13.5 percent of the working age population but 60 percent of the unemployed,‚Äù it said.

Modi has faced criticism for not doing enough to create jobs for millions of unemployed young people despite official annual economic growth of about 7 percent for the past five years.

An official survey that the government withheld showed unemployment rose to its highest level in at least 45 years in 2017/18, the Business Standard newspaper reported in February.

The unemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent in February 2019, its highest since September 2016, and up from 5.9 percent in February 2018, according to data compiled by the private research house, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

The report suggested the next government should consider an urban employment guarantee scheme to create jobs, build infrastructure and provide services.

India has a rural jobs guarantee programme, launched in 2006, which offers work to about 70 million rural people at the minimum wage for 100 days a year.

MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Narendra Modi faces a jobs problem. Early results on Thursday suggest the prime minister‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata party has won a second term. Filled with nationalist sentiment following air strikes against Pakistan earlier this year, voters have looked past an employment crisis. The leader of this $3 trillion economy can‚Äôt afford to do the same.

Getting a grip on the scale of India‚Äôs unemployment troubles is difficult. The country often switches survey methods, making data hard to compare. Peculiar techniques create implausibly low figures. Numbers leaked earlier this year from the National Sample Survey Office put the rate at 6.1% for the year to June 2018. New Delhi‚Äôs decision to withhold the report - and subsequent resignation of two of its authors in protest - suggests the situation is dire, even if not a 45-year high, as one newspaper asserted.

What‚Äôs more certain is that India needs at least 6 million new jobs each year. Some 12 million people reach the working age annually, but labour force participation is dismal at barely 50%, with a much lower rate for women. People are simultaneously ditching agriculture; the sector indirectly employs almost half the workforce, but is in severe distress due to pricing pressure and water scarcity. Secure, high-quality jobs are rare: last year, there were 25 million applications for 90,000 jobs with the state-run railways.

Modi recognised the problem in 2014, with a promise to create 100 million jobs by 2022 through his ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù push. There are more factories assembling mobile handsets, but manufacturing remains at barely 16% of GDP, well below the 25% target. With a population that will soon get older, plus the rise of automation, many believe the country has missed its opportunity. They see little hope of capitalising on factories forced out of the mainland by a worsening U.S.-China trade war. And still, thanks to poor training, qualified staff are hard to find.

India suffers from one of the highest levels of inequality in the world. In the past five years, desperate farmers have marched in protest into large cities; it‚Äôs easy to see how, without action on everything from skills to employment-creating industries like tourism, that could erupt into something much worse.

Tens of thousands strike in India as slowdown hits jobs,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of workers affiliated to trade unions led a strike in parts of India on Wednesday, disrupting transport and banking services in a protest against privatization and the growing impact of an economic slowdown on jobs.

More than 10 national trade unions affiliated to left-wing parties, including the main opposition Congress, have called for a nationwide protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs labor reforms. Those include the privatization of state run companies Air India and oil major BPCL (BPCL.NS), as well as a merger of public-sector banks.

In the eastern state of West Bengal, workers disrupted train services in Kolkata and other towns while shops and banks were shut at various places.

Buses, taxis and auto rickshaws stayed off the road in West Bengal, Kerala and some other states though the national capital Delhi and the financial hub Mumbai remained largely unaffected.

C.H. Venkatachalam, general secretary of the All India Bank Employees‚Äô Association, said the proposed merger of 10 state banks into four banks would affect jobs and could hit the recovery of bad loans amounting to near $140 billion.

‚ÄúModi government‚Äôs policies have led to a severe economic slowdown and have created bad loans for banks,‚Äù Venkatachalam told Reuters by phone, adding the government should take steps to help boost consumer demand by offering incentives to workers.

The government has warned its employees that participation in the strike in any form would lead to deduction of wages and ‚Äúappropriate disciplinary action‚Äù.

Asia‚Äôs third largest economy is facing its worst slowdown in decades, and the government on Tuesday forecast 5% growth for the current financial year, the slowest pace in 11 years, blamed on weakening demand and private investment.

In a tweet, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the policies of the Modi government have created ‚Äúcatastrophic unemployment‚Äù and weakened state-run companies.

Thousands of people have lost jobs in the manufacturing and the construction sector and debt-ridden companies have cut their investment plans.

The unemployment rate rose to 7.7% in December from 7% a year earlier, data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think tank, showed.

Congress party pivots back to jobs after Modi gets boost on security issues,"GANDHINAGAR, India/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs main opposition Congress party switched its campaign focus back to economic and social issues such as jobs on Tuesday as pollsters said Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs re-election bid has been boosted by hostilities with neighbouring Pakistan.

‚ÄúHow will the youth get jobs? How will women feel safer, and move forward? What will be done for farmers?,‚Äù Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in her first speech since joining the party as a general secretary earlier this year. ‚ÄúThese are the election issues.‚Äù

Her brother, Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, called unemployment the most important issue in the general election, which starts on April 11. Thousands of party supporters clapped and cheered as the siblings spoke at a rally in Gandhinagar, the capital of Modi‚Äôs home state, Gujarat.

Pollsters have said Modi‚Äôs ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has an early advantage after India‚Äôs armed forces clashed with those of arch-rival Pakistan last month.

Before then, the prime minister had been under pressure over unemployment and rising problems for farmers. India‚Äôs unemployment rate shot up to 7.2 percent in February, the highest since September 2016, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.

The BJP lost power in three states late last year.

The jobs numbers took a back seat after a Feb. 14 suicide car bomb that killed 40 Indian security personnel in the disputed region of Kashmir and that was claimed by a Pakistan-based Islamist militant group. In response, India said its warplanes bombed a militant camp inside Pakistan, which responded the next day with an aerial attack of its own.

Amid doubts about the success of the Indian strike, opposition parties including Congress said earlier this month they would launch a united attack on Modi for what they called his politicisation of the armed forces since the confrontation with Pakistan.

Pollsters had said questioning Modi on national security rather than focusing on everyday issues could backfire on the prime minister‚Äôs opponents. BJP leaders have said the government‚Äôs economic record and the tough stance on Pakistan will help it retain power.

Zakir Hussain, who travelled about 85 km (55 miles) to attend the Gandhinagar rally, said he voted for the BJP in the last general election in 2014 but was now impressed by Congress.

‚ÄúCongress has fulfilled the promises it made before the elections,‚Äù Hussain said, referring to the waiving of farm loans in three states where the party won back power from the BJP.

‚ÄúSo I will vote for Congress and they will form the government this time.‚Äù

India shows jobs growth as more than 3 million join social security fund,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - More than three million workers joined India‚Äôs state-run social security fund in six months through February, giving Prime Minister Narendra Modi some ammunition to defend his record on creating jobs ahead of a general election due next year.

A new data series on payrolls released by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) for the first time on Wednesday, however, gives an incomplete picture of how many new jobs are being created in the non-farm sector.

The provisional data showed 472,075 employees were added to the state-run social security fund in February, and 604,557 joined in January, bringing the six-month total to 3.11 million.

‚ÄúThe data shows there was a good increase in jobs every month in the last six months, which will now help fill the missing link for policy-making,‚Äù said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economist at the country‚Äôs largest lender, the State Bank of India.

As nearly 15 million join the workforce every year, India still has a long way to go before the world‚Äôs fastest-growing major economy can cope with the country‚Äôs demographic bulge.

‚ÄúUnemployment is a serious issue in India, and we must be worried over the implications,‚Äù N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based think-tank, said.

Modi won the 2014 election promising to revitalise the economy and create strong jobs growth, but some critics have accused his government of making exaggerated claims over just how well the economy is doing.

India‚Äôs growth stuttered after the government‚Äôs decision to take high denomination bank notes out of circulation overnight in late 2016 in a bid to make the country less reliant on cash transactions and flush out money that was being kept out the taxman‚Äôs sight.

The implementation of the introduction of a national goods and services tax last year also knocked growth, and caused some companies to shed jobs.

Since then an upturn in global and domestic demand, along with some deregulation, has helped the economy regather momentum, and it is expected to grow 7 percent in the fiscal year to March next year.

OVERESTIMATES

To bring more of the vast workforce into the organised sector, Modi this year announced the state would partially cover employers‚Äô contributions to the EPF for three years. The government says it will cover an amount up to 12 percent of employees‚Äô salaries.

As a result of those incentives, critics say the new data series overestimates job creation in the organised sector as many workers who were previously working on contract have been taken on as staff by the same employers and added to the fund.

The unemployment rate in India nearly doubled in the nine months through March, to hit 6.23 percent, and is like to rise to 6.75 percent, according to estimates from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a private consultancy.

FILEP PHOTO: An employee works inside an undergarment factory in Kolkata, India, February 1, 2017. REUTERS/Rupak De Chowdhuri/File Photo

CMIE reckoned the number of jobs actually fell to 406 million in fiscal year just ended, down from 406.7 million in the previous year.

In a bid to boost employment, the government has relaxed labour laws to let companies hire workers on a fixed term basis, while raising social security benefits for them.

Earlier it was mandatory for employers and employees of companies with 20 or more workers to contribute to the EPF, but the government plans to amend the rules so that companies with 10 or more employees have to open an account with the fund for their workers.",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-economy-employment/india-shows-jobs-growth-as-more-than-3-million-join-social-security-fund-idINKBN1HW171,
"Modi will need to hit the ground running with economy, Pakistan","NEW DELHI (Reuters) - From a shortage of job opportunities and a stuttering economy to tense ties with old foe Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will face a host of challenges after winning a big majority on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: Job seekers fill up forms as others line up for registration during a job fair in Chinchwad, India, February 7, 2019. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/File Photo

Modi‚Äôs election victory was on the plank of national security, a campaign that gained strength in February when he sent warplanes into Pakistan to hit a suspected militant camp after a bomb attack in the Kashmir region led to death of 40 Indian police officers.

Investors gave a big thumbs up to Modi‚Äôs victory, hoping the mandate will allow his government to push through reforms. Indian stocks surged more than 5 percent this week and hit record highs, as it became clear that Modi would clinch a second term.

The euphoria quickly evaporated though, with stocks and the rupee ending weaker, as the focus now shifts back to an economy that is faltering, even as the U.S.-China trade war rages and global oil prices tick higher.

Modi‚Äôs immediate challenge will be to boost economic growth, which fell to an annual 6.6% during October-December, its lowest in five quarters. Modi will also need to address a liquidity crisis that is slowly gripping India‚Äôs shadow banks.

Other economic indicators signal no relief: industrial output and manufacturing growth, have all weakened in recent quarters, even as car sales, two-wheeler and airline passenger traffic numbers slumped in April.

‚ÄúThe underlying macro continues to remain bad, and we are seeing very strong signs that the economy is under pressure,‚Äù said Aishvarya Dadheech, fund manager Ambit Asset Management.

‚ÄúWhen things are so bad, you don‚Äôt need an unstable government on top of it.‚Äù

TIGHT FINANCES

Even if Modi wants to step up federal funding to boost growth, his hands will be tied. Lower revenue collections and populist measures announced to lure voters will pinch his new administration, making his task more difficult.

When Modi took power for his first term, global oil prices slumped, giving his government breathing room. But as he gets set for a second, rising oil prices will push the current account deficit higher and finance ministry sources told Reuters this month there was no scope of stimulus.

Concern has been growing about a liquidity crunch in the shadow banking sector, which comprises of more than 10,000 firms with a combined balance-sheet worth about $304 billion.

Last year, the government took control of Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services after it defaulted on debt. Another firm, Dewan Housing Finance Corp, said this week it would not allow depositors to prematurely withdraw funds.

‚ÄúThe easiest way to make availability of capital and credit across sectors is by restoring confidence‚Äù in the shadow banking sector, said Rajesh Cheruvu, chief investment officer at Mumbai-based WGC Wealth.

Modi will also need to deal with increasing frustration over jobs. Unemployment rose to 7.6% in April, the highest since October 2016, and up from 6.71% in March, data from private think-tank the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showed.

While tackling economic problems at home, Modi will also need keep a close eye on relations with Pakistan. Tension remains high after they came close to war following February‚Äôs militant attack.

Pakistan on Wednesday signalled a willingness to open talks, with Foreign Minister Shah Mehmud Qureshi saying ‚Äúwe never speak bitterly, we want to live like good neighbours and settle our outstanding issues‚Äù.

But on Thursday, when Modi‚Äôs victory seemed assured, Pakistan appeared to issue a warning with a test of a surface-to-surface ballistic missile capable of delivering conventional and nuclear weapons.",https://in.reuters.com/article/india-election-issues/modi-will-need-to-hit-the-ground-running-with-economy-pakistan-idINKCN1ST1AB,

REUTERS/Adnan Abidi

Congress has consistently trailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in opinion polls, despite winning three key state elections late last year amid farm distress and a jobs shortage.

Releasing its manifesto for a staggered general election that starts on April 11, Congress highlighted job creation, tackling farm distress and empowerment of women among its top priorities. Votes will be counted on May 23.

Party president Rahul Gandhi said Congress would expand an existing jobs programme to guarantee 150 days of work a year to rural households, up from 100 days.

‚ÄúThe main issues in the country today are unemployment and farmer distress,‚Äù said Gandhi, releasing the manifesto. ‚ÄúThe economy is jammed, and everyone agrees that India‚Äôs economy is stuck, so that needs to be restarted.‚Äù

Congress also promised to simplify a goods and services tax, quickly fill 2.2 million government jobs nationwide, create 1 million more on rural and urban development panels, and reward businesses for employment generation.

‚ÄúOver a five-year period, I do think we can bring unemployment down to 3 percent to 4 percent,‚Äù Praveen Chakravarty, a party official who analyses data, told Reuters.

‚ÄúWe can certainly more than halve the unemployment number in a five-year period.‚Äù

‚ÄúAMBITIOUS MANIFESTO‚Äù

Gandhi said Congress had won voters‚Äô hearts with last week‚Äôs plan to hand 72,000 rupees ($1,041) a year to India‚Äôs poorest, a promise the BJP has dismissed as a bluff and some economists have called fiscally irresponsible.

‚ÄúThis is an ambitious manifesto,‚Äù said Shilan Shah, an economist at Capital Economics in Singapore.

‚ÄúThe income scheme promise, though a worthy initiative, looks implausible to implement, considering India‚Äôs limited fiscal space. India does not have the financial infrastructure in place to give such handouts.‚Äù

The BJP has focused on national security amid fresh hostilities with arch rival Pakistan, after a February militant attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops in Kashmir was claimed by an Islamist group based in the neighbouring country.

Modi‚Äôs party came down hard on Congress for its pledge to amend a law that gives special powers to armed forces battling the Kashmir insurgency, in a bid to balance security needs and human rights concerns.

‚ÄúSome of the ideas in the Congress manifesto are positively dangerous and they will result in the Balkanisation of India,‚Äù Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who heads the BJP‚Äôs election publicity committee, told reporters.

Congress leaders later clarified that they would review the immunity granted to security forces only in cases of enforced disappearance, sexual violence and torture.

Congress, which had accused the government of trying to suppress dissent after a colonial-era sedition law was used recently against students marking the anniversary of the execution of a Kashmiri separatist, also vowed to scrap a law it said has been ‚Äúmisused and, in any event, become redundant‚Äù.

‚ÄúAnti national acts will no more be a crime. Whichever party makes such announcements, that party does not deserve a single vote,‚Äù Jaitley said.

"Eyeing election, Rahul Gandhi sets out small business focus","LONDON (Reuters) - Rahul Gandhi, leader of opposition Congress party, said he would seek to shift the focus of India‚Äôs economic policy towards supporting small and medium-sized firms if he won power at an upcoming election.

File Photo: Rahul Gandhi speaks at an event In Singapore March 8, 2018. REUTERS/Thomas White

The fourth-generation politician of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty spoke to reporters and academics in London, criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi for concentrating economic support on big companies at the expense of job-creating smaller enterprises.

Speaking ahead of an election due early next year, Gandhi used a broad question and answer session covering foreign policy toward neighbours China and Pakistan and even Brexit, to sketch out his approach to defeating the Hindu nationalist Modi.

‚ÄúOf course we have to support the large industries, but the focus has to shift to developing small and medium businesses,‚Äù he said at the International Institute of Strategic Studies.

The centrist Congress party has been critical of the Modi government‚Äôs job creation record, and Gandhi said the solution to the unemployment problem was a shift away from what he called Modi‚Äôs focus on ‚Äúlarge industrialists‚Äù.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to get the jobs from there,‚Äù Gandhi said.

‚ÄúYou are going to get jobs from small and medium businesses, you are going to get jobs from a transformation of agriculture, you are going to get jobs from construction, you are going to get from building housing.‚Äù

He said the party could also consider ‚Äústrategic plays‚Äù such as opening up the air travel sector like China has done.

Modi‚Äôs inability to generate tens of millions of jobs for the country‚Äôs youth - a promise which helped him secure the largest mandate in three decades in 2014 - would be the biggest threat to his bid for another term in the general election due by May, political analysts have said.

The government told parliament in July that creating jobs was a priority. The labour ministry said it was ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù the private sector, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investments, and increasing public spending on various state-run employment-generation programmes.

Opinion polls show Modi remains the front runner to win another five-year term, but his Bharatiya Janata Party has suffered reverses in some local elections in the past few months that have energized the opposition.

BALANCING ROLE

On foreign policy, Gandhi said India was uniquely positioned to act as a balance between the West and China, defusing tensions that have emerged during Beijing‚Äôs ascent to economic superpower status.

‚ÄúIndia can play a balancing role - India has some of the design elements, some of the ideas that can bring people together and build a bridge,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúWe specialise in reducing confrontations.‚Äù

He was less optimistic about the prospect of renewing relations with neighbouring Pakistan after its new Prime Minister Imran Khan offered an olive branch to India by proposing talks to resolve a long-standing dispute over Kashmir.

‚ÄúPakistan ... is a number of institutions, so the difficulty from an Indian perspective is which institution do you talk to? Some of those institutions are hostile to India,‚Äù Gandhi said.

The seven-phase election, the world‚Äôs biggest democratic exercise, began on April 11 and winds up on May 19. Votes will be counted and the result announced on May 23.

Modi‚Äôs Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) went into the election as front-runner, buoyed by his image as tough and decisive after he ordered a military strike on Pakistan over a militant bomb attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

But his opponents have maintained their focus on farm distress and unemployment, issues that helped the main opposition Congress party defeat the BJP in state assembly elections in three rural states late last year.

Now the opposition believes the tide is turning.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve all collectively recognised the reality that the BJP is losing significant votes, therefore we are mutually exploring the formation of a cohesive and durable government that will fulfil the aspirations of India,‚Äù Congress spokesman Sanjay Jha said.

He said the negotiations among opposition parties to work out a ‚Äúviable alternative‚Äù to Modi‚Äôs government would be finalised before the May 23 result.

Taking the lead in preparations to take power is N. Chandrababu Naidu, the chief minister of the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, and formerly a BJP ally, according to his regional Telugu Desam Party (TDP).

Naidu has been in touch with leaders of most opposition parties, meeting some in person, TDP officials said.

Modi and other BJP leaders brush off the opposition threat.

BJP President Amit Shah goaded the opposition on Thursday to name its prime ministerial candidate, amid criticism of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty that has dominated India‚Äôs politics for much of its history since independence from Britain in 1947.

Congress‚Äôs Jha, asked if Gandhi would be candidate for prime minister, said there was ‚Äúno talent deficit‚Äù in the opposition.

‚ÄòMANY CHOICES‚Äô

Congress was criticised for failing to strike an election alliance with many anti-Modi regional parties, some of them caste-based and run by politicians with much more experience than Gandhi.

They include Mamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal state, and Mayawati, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state.

Naidu has been negotiating with both of them as well as the chief of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), based in the eastern state of Odisha.

Political strategists have said that the BJD, the fifth largest party in the 545-seat lower house of parliament, could emerge as kingmaker.

The BJD has also been wooed by Modi, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter, but the party said it would only make a decision after the results are out.

TDP spokesman Lanka Dinakar said he was confident the BJD would join with the opposition.

‚ÄúWe have many choices to replace Modi,‚Äù he said.

In some good news for Gandhi, the Supreme Court dismissed a petition filed by a BJP member seeking an investigation of suspicion he holds British citizenship.

Holding dual nationality is against the law and the government last month asked Gandhi to respond to a separate complaint on the issue filed by a BJP lawmaker.

Congress has said Gandhi is an Indian citizen by birth and that he had never held a passport of any other country.

Annual retail inflation INCPIY=ECI increased to 5.54% last month, faster than the 4.62% rate in October and ahead of 5.26% forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.

October industrial output fell 3.8% year on year, dropping for the third straight month, with all three major sectors ‚Äî mining, manufacturing and electricity - shrinking, according to the government data published on Thursday.

This is the first such continued fall in the country‚Äôs industrial output since it was hit by the global recession that began in 2008.

‚ÄúToday‚Äôs IIP-CPI mix clearly signals that India is entering into a kind of stagflationary phase,‚Äù said Rupa Rege-Nitsure, Chief Economist, L&T Financial Services.

Last month, Former Indian Prime Minister and economist Manmohan Singh had also warned of stagflation, which means lofty inflation amid rising unemployment and stagnant demand. He said, however, that the country had not currently entered stagflation.

This is the second month in a row that retail inflation has remained above the central bank‚Äôs medium-term target of 4%.

Increasing inflation and the growth rate slipping to a more than six year low of 4.5% in the July-September period could make policy makers and the Reserve Bank of India walk a tightrope in the coming months.

Already concerns on the inflation front prevented the Reserve Bank of India from cutting its key lending rate for the sixth straight time earlier this month, despite slashing its growth rate forecast for 2019-20 to 5%, which would be the lowest since the 2008 financial crisis.

Various measures from Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government like cutting corporate tax rate and incentivising commercial banks to pump in liquidity into the struggling shadow banking industry has not yielded results.

In July-September period India‚Äôs growth continued to slide and came at a six year low of 4.5%.

The government is also considering more stimulus for the economy but that could mean widening its fiscal deficit as tax revenue collection has remained weak and some estimates suggest a shortfall of over 2 trillion rupees in collections in 2019-20.

WEAK DEMAND

Four analysts estimated November core inflation, which strips off food and fuel prices to reflect the demand in the economy, remained flat at 3.40%-3.6% against 3.44%-3.60% in October.

Weak demand is reflected in the power, fuel, real estate and sales of vehicles, which have resulted in hundreds of thousands of job losses in some industries.

India‚Äôs power demand rose 1.2% in the eight months that ended in November, with consumption falling for four months straight, signalling a worsening industrial slowdown that has already stifled economic growth.

Diesel consumption, a barometer of industrial activity, grew 1% between April and November, government data shows. Demand for the fuel had grown 3% during the year that ended in March. [O/INDIA2]

Domestic passenger vehicle sales fell in November for the 13th consecutive month with no sign of an immediate recovery.

Economists expect RBI to continue to hold its key interest rate in February due to rising inflation, which would mean the onus of reviving growth would be on the government that is expected to present the budget in the same month.

‚ÄúWith the likely bottoming of growth and elevated inflation as well as concerns on large fiscal slippages, the policy rate (by RBI) may remain on hold in FY20,‚Äù said Sujan Hajra, chief economist at Anand Rathi Securities.

Retail food prices, which make up nearly half of India‚Äôs inflation basket, increased 10.01% in November from a year earlier, against 7.89% in October.

India's economy seen growing at 4.7% in September quarter,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India‚Äôs economy probably expanded at its weakest pace in more than six years in the quarter to September, a Reuters poll showed, as consumer demand and private investment weakened further and a global slowdown hit exports.

The median of a poll of economists showed annual growth in gross domestic product of 4.7% in the quarter, down from 5.0% in the previous three months and 7% for the corresponding period of 2018.

Economic growth could dip to around 4% in the September quarter, two domestic television channels said on Wednesday, citing government sources.

If the latest figure for expansion of gross domestic product is 4.7% or less, the quarter will have registered the slowest expansion in 26 quarters, since 4.3% in January-March 2013.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs government has taken several steps, including cutting corporate tax in September, to boost investments and bolster economic growth.

Economists in a Reuters poll predicted the Reserve Bank of India would cut its repo rate for the sixth time in a row, by 25 basis points, to 4.90% at its Dec. 3-5 meeting.

‚ÄúAgrarian distress and dismal income growth so far, coupled with subdued income growth expectation in urban areas, have weakened consumption demand considerably,‚Äù said Devindra Pant, chief economist at Fitch arm India Ratings & Research.

‚ÄúEven the festive demand has failed to revive it,‚Äù he said, citing data on non-food credit, auto sales and select fast moving consumer goods.

‚ÄúECONOMIC EMERGENCY‚Äù

On Wednesday, in a heated parliamentary debate on the economic slowdown affecting jobs, opposition parties said million of people had lost their jobs and the country faced a ‚Äúeconomic emergency‚Äù.

In her reply, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the economy faced a slowdown but no ‚Äúrecession‚Äù and cited several government measures to support economic growth.

On Thursday, she sought parliament‚Äôs approval to spend $2.7 billion in addition to a budgeted 27.86 trillion rupees ($388 billion) in the 2019/20 fiscal year.

Economists said with persistently tight domestic credit and weak corporate profits, India‚Äôs recovery could be delayed and the pick-up would remain below potential.

India needs to grow at around 8% to create enough jobs for its millions of young people joining the labor force each year.

The unemployment rate in October rose to 8.5%, its highest since August 2016, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), though the government estimates that urban unemployment declined.

Some economists, however, said economic growth could pick up in the second half of the current fiscal year, after the government took steps to support real estate and non-bank finance companies.

‚ÄúThe economic slowdown has bottomed out in the September quarter,‚Äù said N.R. Bhanumurthy, an economist at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a Delhi-based government think tank.

‚ÄúWith easing of credit and pick up in festival demand, economic growth is expected to pick up from October onward.‚Äù

India's jobs deficit: Project in Gujarat struggling to create employment,"GANDHINAGAR, India (Reuters) - When he was chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat in 2011, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off an ambitious project to develop a financial hub in the style of Singapore or Dubai.

The developers were tasked with transforming an expanse larger than New York‚Äôs Central Park into a city with more than 100 skyscrapers supporting more than 1 million jobs - all within a decade.

Nearly eight years later, Gujarat International Finance Tec-City, or GIFT City, supports only 9,000 jobs and only about 3 million of its 62 million square feet of planned development have been built, according to documents from the company‚Äôs current presentations to investors reviewed by Reuters, and interviews with GIFT officials. Three million square feet are under construction.

Despite efforts by the Modi government over the past five years to offer tax and regulatory concessions, and a big push to get banks and brokerages into GIFT, the project remains far short of expectations. GIFT‚Äôs future is uncertain, with its main partner in financial trouble over soured bets in other projects.

The lack of development and job creation at GIFT, critics say, reflects one of Modi‚Äôs challenges as a whole as he begins a second term in office.

Critics contend GIFT is a high-profile example of some of Modi‚Äôs ill-conceived and over-ambitious initiatives. They note demonetization - Modi‚Äôs move in 2016 to ban all high-value currency notes then circulating - is another big example of overstretching, as was his government‚Äôs hurried and botched rollout of a nationwide goods and services tax. Those moves stung small businesses and dented India‚Äôs economy.

‚ÄúThe real issue is Mr. Modi‚Äôs quixotic approach to macro-economic management,‚Äù said Sebastian Morris, a senior faculty member of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, one of the country‚Äôs top business schools.

He said GIFT was impracticable, ignoring issues such as location and skills availability. Some bankers also complained that the Gujarat state‚Äôs decades-long alcohol prohibition policy hasn‚Äôt helped either.

Modi‚Äôs office and the Gujarat chief minister‚Äôs office did not respond to requests for comment.

A spokesman for GIFT said that the project‚Äôs timeline had been roiled by subdued demand after the global financial crisis and the lack of a clear regulatory framework until 2014, when Modi took power.

GIFT is now at an ‚Äúinflection point,‚Äù as the Modi government only set up a favorable tax regime in 2016, the spokesman said, adding that dozens of finance and technology firms, including Tata Consultancy Services and Axis Bank, have now set up shop in GIFT.

He said two foreign banks, which he declined to name, are expected to begin operating there.

India‚Äôs two top bourses have begun international operations in GIFT and trading volumes have grown, but are still a fraction of that at India‚Äôs main exchanges, making firms tentative about trading via GIFT.

‚ÄúLocation has been a huge problem,‚Äù said a retired state-government bureaucrat involved in the project for four years, who asked not to be named as he is not authorized to speak to the media. ‚ÄúMost companies are willing to pay higher rents and operate out of Mumbai because the talent pool exists.‚Äù

IMAGE MAKEOVER

GIFT was conceptualized in 2007, soon after Modi returned from a trip to Singapore. He was eager to be seen as a business-friendly leader and rebrand himself in the wake of the 2002 Hindu-Muslim riots in Gujarat that tainted his image, four people who closely worked with Modi since 2003 told Reuters.

GIFT was set up as a joint venture between the government of Gujarat and Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services Ltd (IL&FS), which provides construction services and financing for infrastructure.

Lease terms required that Gujarat get 50 percent of the profit from the sale of development rights in the first phase, and 80 percent thereafter. Reuters could not determine how much has been spent on development so far.

To add to GIFT‚Äôs troubles, IL&FS, which is laden with 910 billion rupees ($12.95 billion) of debt, largely tied to road and other infrastructure projects unrelated to GIFT, defaulted on several debt obligations late in 2018.

One source involved in the project said IL&FS‚Äôs woes had little to with GIFT, and he estimates that less than 0.5 percent of IL&FS‚Äôs outstanding debt is tied to GIFT projects.

The defaults by IL&FS and its group entities relate to loans and bonds financing other infrastructure projects as well as unsecured lending to non-creditworthy entities, according to an interim report from audit firm Grant Thornton, which IL&FS‚Äôs new board hired to dig into the books.

India‚Äôs government took over the company in October, in a rare move that it said was needed to protect the country‚Äôs financial system and markets from potential collapse.

Law enforcement officials are also investigating IL&FS over potential fraud. Last month, India‚Äôs Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO) arrested the former chairman of IL&FS and accused him of abusing his powers and granting loans to entities that were not creditworthy.

IL&FS has not publicly responded to the allegations and did not respond to multiple requests from Reuters for comment. The former chairman and his lawyer were also not immediately reachable for comment.

GIFT‚Äôs chief executive, Ajay Pandey, quit last month without citing any reasons. He did not respond to calls and messages seeking comment on his departure.

The GIFT spokesman said that Pandey stepped down as part of a larger exodus of top IL&FS officials, and that IL&FS‚Äôs troubles would not stall the project.

IL&FS did not respond to multiple requests for comment about its financial health, the ongoing fraud investigation and its current role in the project.

‚ÄúMr. Modi sold GIFT as the flagship program of Gujarat 12 years ago,‚Äù opposition Congress party spokesman Sam Pitroda told media this month. ‚ÄúToday ... no one talks about it. There are failures after failures.‚Äù

The GIFT spokesman said that the project was in good financial health and that 11,000 people would be working there in the next year.

WRONG PARTNER

Although there are signs for a hospital, a mall and some residential projects at GIFT, much of the land is vacant. A sprawling clubhouse sits largely deserted and only one shop in the city‚Äôs market is open.

The GIFT spokesman said the club has hundreds of members, and the city boasts a cost-effective central cooling system and an underground automated waste disposal system, among other amenities.

Despite that infrastructure, at least one critic is convinced GIFT should have jettisoned IL&FS long ago.

D.C. Anjaria, who brought the idea of GIFT to Modi and was an independent director on the board, has since filed a public-interest lawsuit against GIFT, its board and IL&FS alleging lack of corporate governance and other misdeeds.

His lawsuit alleges that IL&FS was made a partner in GIFT without a fair tendering process and that IL&FS gave contracts to entities despite conflicts of interest.

Reuters was unable to verify these allegations or ascertain whether they had any effect on the project‚Äôs development. The case is being heard in the Gujarat High Court and it next comes up for hearing in June.

IL&FS did not respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit and the GIFT spokesman declined to comment. IL&FS has not publicly commented on the suit, and Reuters was unable to view court filings on the matter.

‚ÄúIt was a wrong partner,‚Äù said Anjaria, who no longer has any ties to GIFT. ‚ÄúThey should have gotten rid of IL&FS long ago.‚Äù

Since his concept was pitched 12 years ago, Anjaria said, the world has changed significantly.

‚ÄúToday you are at a time when London, the biggest financial center, is struggling to keep its status. So where is this poor GIFT going to be?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only surviving because of the political support of Modi.‚Äù

Despite the delays and difficulties, some still hope GIFT will one day flourish, especially with Modi‚Äôs return to power.

Although he today often waits 40 minutes for a taxi, Dinesh Joshi, a 28-year-old restaurant manager in GIFT, hopes to buy an apartment there, certain the development will grow.

Oil Price War: A silver lining for Indian economy,"The crude price fall also provides more fiscal space.

By Pravakar Sahoo & Bhavesh Garg

Saudi Arabia sliced its oil prices by more than 30% and has set plans for a rise in production in April. Given the lack of consensus among OPEC+ countries and competition to have a better share in the world oil market, lower crude prices are going to stay for sometime. Also, the global slowdown, particularly slowing growth of two biggest oil consumers China and India, will keep the demand pressure on crude oil mute. The fall in oil prices indicates a gloomy world economy with weak global consumption demand and hugely disrupted global supply chains because of the coronavirus outbreak. While the price cut will have several macroeconomic implications for the global economy, it is a silver lining for India as it will give more fiscal and monetary space to boost both demand and supply sides.

The world is shifting to cleaner energy fuels for sustainable development and the share of crude oil in the total energy mix has declined from 46% in 1980 to 33% in 2018. India still depends on oil, mostly imported, for around 30% of energy requirement. Oil is one of the largest source of primary commercial energy and a major input in the production process the world over. Therefore, a significant fall in crude price‚Äîalmost by 50% over the last two months‚Äîbrings down energy prices, input costs and overall cost of production. This gives breathing space to industry facing slow demand and excess capacity. The price of energy spills over to other sectors, affecting general price levels, and lower crude price gives more space to monetary authorities for expansionary monetary policy in oil-importing countries. There are downsides‚Äîfall in growth, employment, etc, in oil-exporting countries‚Äîbut the positives outweigh the negatives.

India imported around 214 million tonnes crude oil in 2016-17. The total installed capacity of oil and gas based thermal power stood at 838 MW and 24,897 MW, respectively, in 2018. Crude oil prices have always been determining Indian oil imports bill and subsidies given for petroleum products. For example, oil imports increased from around $83 billion in FY15 to $141 billion in 2018-19 (21.5% in FY15 to 27% as percentage of total imports) mostly due to rise in crude oil prices. In fact, the fall in crude oil prices helped reduce India‚Äôs fiscal deficit in the range of 0.5-1% between 2014 and 2016, and improved the current account balance. Therefore, the current fall in crude price impacts the Indian economy positively‚Äîthrough its macroeconomic effect on trade balance, fiscal balance, domestic inflation, exchange rate, capital flows and overall growth.

The crude price fall also provides more fiscal space. Both central and state governments charge heavy taxes on petroleum products (around 100% on petrol and 70% on diesel) and generate huge tax revenues. In FY19, the combined revenues from petroleum products were Rs 5.3 lakh crore. The government may pass on the benefits to retail customers, which will reduce the general price level bringing down the overall cost of production, which is necessary in the times of lack of demand. The government also has the option to increase levies to garner more revenues apart from less petroleum subsidies meant for petroleum products such as LPG and kerosene. Both ways the outcome is positive. Overall, the oil price fall will bear a positive impact on the twin deficits (trade deficit and fiscal deficit). It will be also interesting to see the market-determined prices of petrol and diesel.

The current scenario not only provides more fiscal space, but is also an opportunity for monetary authorities to combat the economic slowdown. The dollar is the major invoicing and settlement currency in the oil market. A decrease in oil prices will lead to a decrease in prices for tradable goods, causing the real exchange rate to decline. The fall in oil prices may also lead to appreciation of the rupee in the short run, while in the medium term there will be a reduction in the cost of production, which will further lead to a decrease in domestic inflation. Thus, with lower inflationary pressures, the monetary authority may further decrease the policy rate and still be able to attract capital inflows.

The Indian economy is affected by demand slowdown, and industrial growth has been the lowest for the last couple of years. On top of that, the coronavirus has affected production supply chains. In this context, the fall in crude oil prices is a relief for the Indian economy on fiscal, external and monetary fronts. There will be some negative fallout on India‚Äôs petroleum exports‚Äîwhich form one of the top exports‚Äîand remittances (a large number of Indians work in oil-exporting countries like Saudi Arabia, and India is one of the biggest recipient of remittances from oil-exporting countries).

The price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia and the falling demand of oil from major oil-importing countries like China and India will keep oil prices from rising. It‚Äôs a blessing in disguise for the Indian economy, which is currently grappling with severe slowdown and seeks a quick turnaround.

Budget 2020 hasn‚Äôt violated fiscal discipline: FM Sitharaman,"Budget 2020-21: On the Budget, Sitharaman said several novel measures have been initiated to address the demand side and allocations have been made to enhance consumption.

Union Budget 2020 India: A day after Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das sought to allay fears of the Budget proposal on fiscal slippage causing a spike in inflationary pressure, finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman reiterated on Sunday that the Budget FY21 hasn‚Äôt violated the fiscal discipline.

Addressing a gathering of industry representatives in Hyderabad, she said, ‚ÄúWe have not really breached the FRBM. We have not gone outlandish on it. We have kept fiscal discipline, which is a USP for both the Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Narendra Modi governments.‚Äù

Speaking to reporters, alongside Sitharaman, after a meeting of the RBI board in New Delhi on Saturday, Das too had said the government had largely remained within the deficit road map set by the FRBM Act.

Acknowledging that the FM hadn‚Äôt really succumbed to the temptation to launch a fiscal stimulus to pump-prime the economy, former RBI governor D Subbarao wrote in The Indian Express on February 12, ‚Äú It has long been known that the true fiscal deficit is higher than what the government‚Äôs books show. To her credit, the finance minister took a step towards transparency by admitting to off-balance sheet borrowings of 0.8% of GDP for both the current and next fiscal years ‚Äî acknowledging that the fiscal deficit would actually be higher at 4.6 per cent and 4.3 per cent of GDP respectively. This is already excessive. Add to this the unrealistic projections of revenue growth and disinvestment proceeds for next year and we have a potentially unsustainable fiscal situation. Any stimulus on top of this would have been clearly unwarranted, and for many reasons‚Äù.

Invoking an escape clause, the Budget for FY21 proposed to inflate fiscal deficit by 50 basis points for this financial year and the next to 3.8% and 3.5% of GDP, respectively, amid a sharp cut in the corporate tax rate and a shortfall in revenue mo-up following a broader economic slowdown.

On the Budget, Sitharaman said several novel measures have been initiated to address the demand side and allocations have been made to enhance consumption.

Private airport operators want moratorium on revenue payments to AAI,"The Delhi International Airport is run by the GMR group, which pays 45.99% of its revenues as fees to the AAI.

By Anwesha Ganguly

India‚Äôs private airport operators want the government to impose a moratorium on revenue payments to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) as the financial crisis for the aviation sector deepens amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Currently, private airport operators like the GMR and GVK have concession agreements with AAI, under which they must pay a percentage of their revenue to the government authority. According to industry estimates, airports in the Asia Pacific are expected to face a 24% drop in revenue during January-March.

Industry sources said international traffic to India‚Äôs busiest airports have less than halved as on date. With the government‚Äôs decision not to allow any international aircraft to land in India from March 22 for one week, the aeronautical revenue stream will dry up further. ‚ÄúWe are meeting with the ministry next week to ask for a moratorium on payment of revenue share as a part of concession agreements. We have also sought waiver on debt obligations to banks and financial institutions as well as moratorium on loans installments,‚Äù said Satyan Nayar, secretary-general, Association of Private Airport Operators (APAO). The country‚Äôs busiest airports, including the Delhi, Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mumbai airports, are run by private operators.

The Delhi International Airport is run by the GMR group, which pays 45.99% of its revenues as fees to the AAI, while the Mumbai International Airport is run by the GVK group, which pays AAI 38.7% of its revenues. Airport operators generate revenue from aeronautical operations and non-aeronautical sources including services provided at airports. Industry sources said the COVID-19 outbreak has not only put a dent on revenue from airport traffic, but also significantly reduced non-aeronautical revenues. ‚ÄúIt is difficult to gauge the impact right now. But service providers like food and beverage outlets, cargo service providers, ground handling providers, are also seeking deferment and moratorium on their payment obligations, so that is also a huge impact,‚Äù one person said.

Several industry bodies have already made representations to the government to provide financial support to private airports. Last week, APAO had made a representation to the ministry seeking levy of an airport charge to offset the reduced revenue. The suggestion was met with criticism from international lobbies. Earlier this week, the industry body Airports Council International (ACI) called for a suspension of the 80/20 rule, which stipulates that airlines would lose their slots in airports if they are not used 80% of the time, till June.

The body also called for reduction in taxes. The travel and tourism industry is reeling from the impact of the pandemic outbreak, as governments across the world have closed their borders to foreigners. According to industry estimates, around 70% of the 5.5 crore people directly and indirectly employed by the industry could lose their jobs. FE earlier reported that tour operators have also sought financial support from the government. Another tourism industry body wrote to the government on Thursday seeking moratorium on payments. The International Air Travel Association had estimated an impact of up to $113 billion as a result of these disruptions.",https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/private-airport-operators-want-moratorium-on-revenue-payments-to-aai/1904123/,
Spend money to save the poor: Why a rate cut is of no use,"The funds should be channelled into smaller businesses, which could be given a line of credit and allowed a moratorium for tax payments, maybe even loan re-payments.

It is clear now that the economy is going into a prolonged downswing, and chances of a 5% growth in FY21 are slim. Unless the government steps in with some stimulus, even a 4.6-4.7% GDP growth looks like a tall ask. While there is a clamour for a rate cut, that could prove less useful at this point because corporate credit risk is set to deteriorate sharply, and banks should be very cautious. But, a fiscal stimulus of at least Rs 1-1.5 lakh crore is needed even if tax collections come in well below targets‚Äîthey could fall short by 30-35%. We need to keep the economy going, and this isn‚Äôt the time to worry about high fiscal deficits.

The Rs 45,000 crore that the government is expected to mop up from the higher levies on auto fuels will come in handy; with Brent crude trading at sub-$28/barrel, it could hike levies further. It should. This time around, though, the government should not make the mistake of frittering away resources on large and highly profitable companies‚Äînever in India‚Äôs tax history has a measure been so ill-thought-out and ill-timed, and cost us so dearly.

No tax-breaks for India Inc, and no tweaking the rules to benefit investors in stocks, or mutual funds. The funds should be channelled into smaller businesses, which could be given a line of credit and allowed a moratorium for tax payments, maybe even loan re-payments.

The government would do well to spend on projects‚Äîconstruction of infrastructure, roads‚Äîto ensure daily wage earners are able to make a living, and small farmers, too, could be helped. Those most vulnerable to losing their incomes are workers in the informal or unorganised economy‚Äîwaiters, truck and taxi drivers, salespersons, shop assistants, etc. While the corona pandemic could end by early May, this category would, nonetheless, be the worst hit.

It is wishful thinking as the government doesn‚Äôt seem to be serious about meaningful reform, but this is a good time to roll out labour reforms. By protecting labour, the government has only frightened the corporate sector from hiring; easier hire-and-fire rules would encourage them to take on more people. And, if we can bring down wage costs, we stand some chance of competing with peer economies.

Meanwhile, RBI could consider some forbearance on asset classification for MSMEs; a 50 basis point rate cut, should it happen, can, at best, spur lending at the margin. Those who believe the loan markets will take off are underestimating the extent to which finances of businesses can deteriorate, and risk perceptions; judging by the recent spike in corporate bond yields, it is evident lenders are already cautious. Remember, loan growth has trended down to near-two year lows, dropping to sub-6%, and this was before we realised what coronavirus can do to us. There is some Rs 3 lakh crore of liquidity lying around, but banks don‚Äôt want to lend. Are we expecting risk-averse banks to turn adventurous at a time when businesses are surely going to becoming weaker? That is unlikely. From a borrower‚Äôs point of view, the already small appetite could become smaller. No promoter is going to invest because interest rates have fallen 50 bps; in fact, real lending rates have actually gone up by about 50-60 bps in the past few months. The collapse in demand‚Äîfor goods and services‚Äîexacerbated by the epidemic, will see production being scaled down. Given the uncertainty surrounding businesses, jobs, incomes, and even wealth, few individuals would want to leverage themselves at this point.

To be sure, MSMEs will need credit; the disruption will all but choke off their cash flows. From a lender‚Äôs point of view, however, it is critical to use capital carefully, and to lend only to the soundest and sturdiest of businesses; it may sound harsh, but there is little point throwing good money after bad, and any additional lines of credit should be sanctioned only where it is certain that the money will be put to good use. In times of severe supply chain disruptions, it is difficult to use working capital efficiently. But, capital is precious‚Äîbecause there is so little of it, and it is becoming costlier by the day‚Äîand so, must be put away. Indeed, even before one talks of growth capital, it looks like banks are going to need a lot more capital for provisions; there is likely to be a sharp increase in defaults, and NPAs are now certain to rise for a host of sectors like construction, real estate, telecom, tourism, transport, and hundreds of companies are likely to be downgraded.

The fact is that even the best and biggest of companies are going to be impacted, and as cash flows weaken, bankers will not be able to justify additional credit. MSMEs are going to be in even bigger trouble because they simply do not have the financial wherewithal to tide over a crisis of this nature. If, as S&P says, global recession is here, and the global economy will grow at 1-1.5%, and Asia-Pac at less than 3% in 2020, India‚Äôs exports, which are already under-performing, will be badly hit. But, we must protect the banks.

At a time when businesses and trade are frozen and the coronavirus scare is mounting every day across the globe, sticking to the fiscal mandate may not do any good to the economy. Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures and out of box thinking and we thus strongly recommend that the increased excise revenue from oil should not be used for bridging the fiscal gap and pleasing the markets; rather sound economics demands it must be used as a fiscal package for income support to the people working in the unorganized sector who are already facing the brunt of loss of jobs, SBI said in its Ecowrap report.

The COVID-19 is likely to impact India‚Äôs fiscal numbers in FY20 though it might be too early to say, possibly in FY21, said SBI Ecowrap report. However, it will be completely foolhardy to stick to any mandated fiscal rules in times of the current crisis that is now threatening to rip apart the entire global financial ecosystem, it added. The State Bank of Indian has also suggested RBI to come out with a comprehensive scheme for sectors such as aviation, textiles, hotels, automobiles and food processing, that are severely hit and facing job losses.

It is expected that COVID-19 will have an impact on India‚Äôs GDP through trade, hotels, transport, etc that will have significant pressures on the fiscal deficit. In FY21, nominal GDP growth target is 10 per cent and every 10 basis points slippage in nominal GDP numbers in FY21 will push up the fiscal deficit by roughly 1 basis point. Meanwhile, though India has already taken various steps to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the rise in active cases in the next few weeks will determine the extent of the country‚Äôs preparedness.",https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/need-for-extraordinary-measures-in-extraordinary-times-sbi-suggests-this-to-govt-rbi/1903349/,
Post-retirement jobs ‚Äòscar on independence of judiciary‚Äô,"Former CJI Ranjan Gogoi

The President nominating‚Äîon the advice of the Centre‚Äîformer Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha (RS) is a sad day for India‚Äôs judiciary. Such post-retirement placement‚ÄîGogoi retired in November 2019‚Äîcasts a shadow on the major judgments given by the Supreme Court (SC) during Gogoi‚Äôs tenure, even if they were, in fact, jurisprudentially sound. Many of the judgments, like those on Rafale and Ayodhya, it so happens, went in favour of the government. Indeed, it is precisely to avoid such situations that, as a general rule, post-retirement appointments are frowned upon in such posts, among regulators, etc. If, however, such appointments are allowed, the argument goes, the about-to-retire person may just be induced to give the ‚Äòright‚Äô judgment/decision. Interestingly, while the Trai Act prohibits government jobs for any regulator, in 2014, an ex-Trai chief was appointed principal secretary, and the government then changed the Trai Act through an ordinance. More recently, the current Trai chief was re-hired after his term came to an end.

Ex-CJI Gogoi‚Äôs nomination to the RS, it has to be said, is not the first such occurrence‚Äîso, this government can‚Äôt be accused of being the only one to commit such improprieties. The PV Narasimha Rao government appointed former CJI Ranganath Misra as the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission in October 1993, a year after his retirement, and Misra was elected to the Rajya Sabha on a Congress ticket in 1998. As a sitting judge of the SC, Misra had been appointed to the single-member commission of inquiry into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots by the Rajiv Gandhi government in April 1985, and had submitted a report exonerating the Congress party and its leaders in February 1987. Former CJI P Sathasivam was named Governor of Kerala by the Modi government in 2014, within months of retirement. Then, there is the case of Baharul Islam, who, as an SC judge in December 1982, had acquitted Jagannath Mishra, the then Congress chief minister of Bihar, in the Patna Urban Cooperative Bank case‚ÄîMishra‚Äôs government, in complete breach of propriety, had ordered the withdrawal of vigilance cases against Mishra. Just weeks after, in January 1983, Islam resigned from the SC, and was elected to the RS on a Congress ticket in 1984.

It is, of course, unrealistic to expect members of judiciary not to hold political opinions. Indeed, Justice VR Krishna Iyer, who delivered several landmark judgments, was a minister in the EMS Namboodiripad government in Kerala before joining the SC; Justice Iyer‚Äôs landmark judgments include Maneka Gandhi (1978), which allowed for a wide range of human rights to become part of the ‚Äòright to life and personal liberty‚Äô, and Ratlam Municipality (1980) that became a precursor to the ‚Äòpolluter pays‚Äô principle. Some countries like the US constitutionally provide for politicised judiciaries with partisan representation. And, Indira Gandhi even infamously called for a ‚Äúdedicated judiciary‚Äù. But, given the faith reposed in the appellate judiciary‚Äôs insularity from politics, a Gogoi nomination shouldn‚Äôt be repeated by any government. Ideally, the former judges themselves should decline such offers. Former CJI Gogoi, and others, would do well to keep in mind the words of a Constitution bench of the SC that was hearing petitions challenging the laws governing quasi-judicial tribunals last year. When senior advocate Arvind Datar spoke of the need to appoint ex-judges to head these specialised tribunals, Justice Gogoi, who was part of the bench, said, ‚ÄúThere is a view point that post-retirement appointment is itself a scar on judicial independence of the judiciary‚Äù. When Datar said it was only a view point and not the law, Gogoi countered that it ‚Äúis a valid and strong point.‚Äù At the Ramnath Goenka lecture, Gogoi spoke of the need for the judiciary to remain ‚Äúuncontaminated‚Äù and ‚Äúindependent‚Äù. Words full of sound and fury, it now appears, but signifying nothing.",https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/post-retirement-jobs-scar-on-independence-of-judiciary/1902694/,
Jammu and Kashmir economy has collapsed due to restrictions imposed since last August: Manish Tewari,"‚ÄúIt will be better if the budget for Jammu and Kashmir could have been discussed in the Assembly,‚Äù he said, adding the August decisions are a ‚Äútragedy‚Äù for these union territories. (File image)

Targeting the government over restrictions imposed in Jammu and Kashmir since August last year, the Congress on Wednesday said the economy of the region has collapsed due to the measures and demanded immediate release of former chief ministers Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah. Initiating a discussion on the budgetary proposals and demand for grants for the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, Congress member Manish Tewari urged the government to ‚Äúopen ears‚Äù and ‚Äúlisten‚Äù to the voices of people as he claimed a ‚Äúdangerous situation‚Äù is developing there.

He said that social peace is important for economic development of a place. Tewari alleged that the decisions of August 5, 2019 to abrogate provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and divide the state into Union territories, have demolished the economy. He said that growth of key sectors, including agriculture and tourism, are declining.

‚ÄúIt will be better if the budget for Jammu and Kashmir could have been discussed in the Assembly,‚Äù he said, adding the August decisions are a ‚Äútragedy‚Äù for these union territories. Citing data of Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he said there was a loss of Rs 18,000 crore. ‚Äú‚Ä¶USD 2.4 billion worth of economy was lost after the decision of August 5-6, 2019,‚Äù he said, adding agriculture sector has lost Rs 10,000 crore in last seven months. Similarly, he said, apple farmers earned Rs 6,500 crore in 2016-17 and after the imposition of restrictions only 50 per cent of harvesting could be done. He said that the tourism industry, which is the biggest after agriculture, has ‚Äútotally collapsed‚Äù.

Tewari said that tourist flow too has impacted as it was estimated that about 21 lakh tourists will come to Jammu and Kashmir but till July 2019, the figure was 5.21 lakh. Over 5.6 lakh jobs are also impacted in the sector and about 50,000 jobs are hit in the carpet sector due to closure of restrictions on internet services. Noting that maximum budget has been allotted to the home affairs department, he said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is an unsustainable model, it will not work.‚Äù These decisions have not been taken keeping in view ‚Äúdiplomatic‚Äù strategies but due to ‚Äúnarrow thought processes‚Äù, he said.

On the abrogation of Article 370, he said the matter is sub-judice in the Supreme Court and ‚ÄúI expect a positive result from that‚Äù. Tewari said that ‚Äúone thing is clear‚Äù from these decisions that ‚Äúthe government want the territory of Jammu and Kashmir and not the people‚Äù. He said that this decision was implemented by deploying additional 40,000 para military force personnel, detention of 5,161 people and imposition of the stringent Public Safety Act (PSA) on 609 people.

‚ÄúWe do not know how many people are in jail in different parts of the country‚Ä¶I demand from the government to put a list informing about the number of people from Jammu and Kashmir who are in different jails,‚Äù he added. He also said that although Lok Sabha member Farooq Abdullah has been released, two former chief ministers ‚ÄìMehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah ‚Äî are still under detention. ‚ÄúI demand immediate release of two former chief ministers‚Ä¶PSA is completely unconstitutional and I condemn this action of the government,‚Äù he said. He said internet closure of over five months in the union territories were relaxed only after the order of the Supreme Court on January 10. However, he said the internet services have not yet resumed completely and only 2G services have been started.

‚ÄúWe seek detail answer from the government on this,‚Äù he added. Intervening, Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that terrorists‚Äô use internet to spread fear and threaten people. Tewari said that terrorism is not a new phenomena and previous governments had dealt with the menace and ‚Äúthis cannot be an excuse to close internet services‚Äù. He added that closure of the services has impacted children a lot and as many as 11,308 schools were closed seven months.

‚ÄúThis is a big damage from the government‚Äôs decision,‚Äù he said, adding judiciary too has collapsed in the union territory and ‚Äúthis is the biggest tragedy‚Äù. He added that since August 5-6, 2019, as many as 459 Habeas corpus petitions are pending. ‚ÄúSo what kind of country we want to make,‚Äù he said, alleging courts are not listing these petitions.

Further Tewari said that now the government seems to realise that the August decision was a ‚Äúmistake‚Äù. Participating on the discussion, Jagdambika Pal of the BJP said the decision has led to development of the union territories. He said that now no one can dare to hoist flag of Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir. He alleged that Pakistan approached against this decision to UN and the US taking ‚Äúviews of Rahul Gandhi (Congress)‚Äù, but they stated that it was India‚Äôs internal matter.

‚ÄúPakistan is now keeping quiet but Congress is still raising the issue,‚Äù he said, adding several projects worth crores of rupees are now under different stages of development in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh. He said bids are being sought for 13 airports and it will give a boost to the tourism sector. He claimed that Delhi riots of last month were pre-planned and Pakistan‚Äôs ISI hand was also there and ‚Äúyou should be ashamed of this‚Äù.

A Raja of the DMK criticised the government‚Äôs decision on Jammu and Kashmir. Concerns raised by Opposition parties on Jammu and Kashmir have not yet been resolved, he said. ‚ÄúThis budget discussion is just ceremonial and not in true spirit because we are not Kashmiris,‚Äù Raja said. He added that a state cannot become prosperous if social harmony will not be there. He said that Home Minister Amit Shah has assured and promised good administration and corruption-free society, but it has not yet been fulfilled completely. The Centre on Tuesday presented a Rs 1-lakh crore Budget for Jammu and Kashmir for 2020-21, and said the ‚Äúhighest ever‚Äù allocations reflect its commitment to make the Union Territory ‚Äúa model of development‚Äù.",https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-economy-has-collapsed-due-to-restrictions-imposed-since-last-august-manish-tewari/1902334/,
S&P lowers India‚Äôs growth forecast to 5.2 per cent in 2020,"The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 per cent during the 2020 calendar. (Reuters photo)

S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday lowered India‚Äôs economic growth forecast to 5.2 per cent for 2020, saying the global economy is entering a recession amid the coronavirus pandemic. The agency had earlier projected a growth rate of 5.7 per cent during the 2020 calendar. Asia-Pacific economic growth in 2020 will more than halve to less than 3 per cent as the ‚Äúglobal economy enters a recession‚Äù, S&P said in a statement. ‚ÄúAn enormous first-quarter shock in China, shutdowns across the US and Europe, and local virus transmission guarantees a deep recession across Asia-Pacific,‚Äù said Shaun Roache, chief Asia-Pacific economist at S&P Global Ratings.

By recession, S&P meant at least two quarters of well below-trend growth sufficient to trigger rising unemployment. ‚ÄúOur estimate of permanent income losses is likely to at least double to more than USD400 billion,‚Äù said Roache. As per the statement, external shocks from the fallout of the global viral spread add a new dimension. People flows from the US and Europe will be decimated for at least two quarters, heaping more pressure on the tourism industry.

If lingering uncertainty results in a strong preference for US dollars, policymakers in Asia‚Äôs emerging markets may be forced into a damaging round of pro-cyclical policy tightening, Roache said. The countries most vulnerable to capital outflows remain India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, he added. ‚ÄúWe lower our forecasts for China, India, and Japan for 2020 to 2.9 per cent, 5.2 per cent and -1.2 pre cent (from 4.8 per cent, 5.7 per cent, and -0.4 per cent previously),‚Äù S&P said in the statement.

The global policy response, including the Federal Reserve‚Äôs policy-rate cut to zero and the Bank of Japan‚Äôs scaled-up asset purchases, will help cushion but not quickly reverse these shocks, it said. Local measures aiming to support vulnerable sectors and workers may help but their effect will ‚Äúwane the longer the crisis lasts‚Äù. It further said the timing of a recovery depends, most of all, on progress in containing the viral spread.

Even if major progress is made during the second quarter, after a sustained period of stressed cash flow many firms will be in no position to resume investing quickly, the S&P said. Households that have either lost their jobs or have worked fewer hours will spend less and banks will be busy managing the deterioration in asset quality, it said. On Tuesday, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service had lowered India‚Äôs economic growth forecast for 2020 to 5.3 per cent (from 5.4 per cent), on coronavirus impact on the economy.",https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/sp-lowers-indias-growth-forecast-to-5-2-per-cent-in-2020/1901639/,
Salesforce hires former banker Arundhati Bhattacharya as India CEO: Report,"Bhattacharya, 64, will be based in Mumbai and will join in April. (PTI)

U.S. cloud-based service provider Salesforce.com Inc has hired Arundhati Bhattacharya, one of India‚Äôs best-known former bankers, as its India chief executive officer, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday.

Bhattacharya declined to comment, while Salesforce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bhattacharya previously headed the State Bank of India (SBI), the country‚Äôs largest lender, and was the first woman to lead the more than 200-year-old bank. She retired from SBI in 2017 after spending four decades in various roles. ‚ÄúShe is a hugely credible name who comes with a wealth of experience and will help Salesforce expand in India,‚Äù said the source, who is aware of the new appointment.

Bhattacharya, 64, will be based in Mumbai and will join in April, the source added. She is currently chairman of SWIFT India, part of a global payments network. Salesforce provides an array of cloud storage and digital services to clients in India, which it sees as a one of its fastest growing regions. In January, Salesforce co-founder Parker Harris met India‚Äôs trade minister in New Delhi and briefed him on the company‚Äôs growth plans.

Govt‚Äôs PMEGP likely to miss FY20 employment target; falling short by these many jobs in micro units,"Till January 31, 2020, the fall in employment generation from FY19 was 47 per cent.

Skilling, Labour, Talent for MSMEs: The number of people employed in India‚Äôs micro-enterprises under the Prime Minister‚Äôs Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP) in the past four financial years and the current FY (till January 31) stood at a little over 20.13 lakh, according to the data shared by MSME Minister Nitin Gadkari in the Rajya Sabha on Monday. Maximum jobs ‚Äî 5.87 lakh during the said period was generated in FY19 while the current FY is likely to create the least number of jobs. While 3.07 lakh jobs have been created till January 31 in the current FY, however, the government is likely to miss the target of creating 5,94,208 jobs (as per the data shared by Gadkari recently in Rajya Sabha) ‚Äî falling short of 2,86,728 jobs for FY20. FY16, FY17, and FY18 saw the employment of 3.23 lakh, 4.07 lakh, and 3.87 lakh people respectively. Till January 31, 2020, the fall in employment generation from FY19 was 47 per cent.

The government helped create nearly 30,000 jobs (in 10 days, that is, till January 31) from 2,78,984 jobs as on January 21, 2020, and would have to create additional 47,788 jobs in every 10-day period to hit the target for FY20. The states leading the tally for maximum jobs creation were Tamil Nadu with 26,928 jobs followed by Gujarat with 24,960 jobs, Jammu and Kashmir with 24,376 people employed, Maharashtra with 24,000 jobs and Uttar Pradesh with 22,456 jobs in their respective micro-enterprises.

Will reveal why I accepted Rajya Sabha nomination after taking oath: Ranjan Gogoi,"Ranjan Gogoi has served as 46th CJI from October 2018 to November 2019.

A day after being nominated to the Rajya Sabha, former Chef Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi said that he will speak in detail why he accepted the nomination to the Upper House after being sworn in. Gogoi‚Äôs nomination was questioned by a section of political parties, including the Congress. Hours after Gogoi‚Äôs nomination to Rajya Sabha, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala shared a number of old articles in which some senior leaders from the BJP had commented against post-retirement jobs to judges.

Surjewala first shared a tweet by sitting cabinet minister Piyush Goyal who had said that the governments had gone too far in creating post retirement positions for judges. ‚ÄúDesire of a post-retirement job influences pre-retirement judgement,‚Äù the minister had said in September 2013. Commenting on this, the Congress leader wrote: ‚ÄúI agree with Modiji‚Äôs Cabinet Minister!‚Äù

Surjewala again shared statements made by former finance minister Arun Jaitley and Nitin Gadkari. Jaitley had said that pre-retirement judgements are sometimes influenced by post-retirement jobs while Gadkari had advocated a cooling-off period of two years between the retirement and appointment of judges.

‚ÄúDid PM Modi consider the advice of his former colleague and Law Minister-Finance Minister, Late Sh. Arun Jaitley before recommending Ex CJI, Ranjan Gogoi to Rajya Sabha?‚Äù Surjewala said in another tweet.

In an apparent response to such observations, the former CJI said: ‚ÄúI will go to Delhi probably tomorrow (Wednesday). Let me first take the oath then I will speak in detail why I accepted this (nomination) and why I am going to Rajya Sabha.‚Äù

Gogoi has served as 46th CJI from October 2018 to November 2019. During his stint as CJI, Gogoi pronounced judgements in some of the high-profile cases such as women‚Äôs entry in Sabarimala, Rafale fighter jet deal and the century-old Ayodhya land dispute case. He was also among the four judges who had held a historic press conference in January 2018.",https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/will-reveal-why-i-accepted-rajya-sabha-nomination-after-taking-oath-ranjan-gogoi/1900673/,
"Opposition sees red over Ranjan Gogoi‚Äôs nomination to Rajya Sabha, leaders allege ‚Äòquid pro quo‚Äô","Randeep Singh Surjewala has questioned the Modi government‚Äôs decision to nominate Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha.

The Congress party has questioned the President‚Äôs decision to nominate former Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha. Party‚Äôs chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala questioned the independence of the judiciary as he referred to late BJP leader Arun Jaitley‚Äôs 2012 remark that ‚Äúthe verdicts are influenced by post-retirement jobs‚Äù.

Questioning the move announced last evening, Surjewala said, ‚ÄúJustice Lokur rightly summarises it ‚Äì Has the last bastion fallen?‚Äù Justice (retired) Madan B Lokur, who has criticised the move, was part of the group of the then senior justices who called an unprecedented press conference in January 2018 to lash out at then CJI Dipak Misra. Ranjan Gogoi was also part of that press conference.

Justice Lokur told The Indian Express that there has been speculation for sometime now about what honorific would Justice Gogoi get. He said that the nomination is not surprising, but what is surprising is that it came so soon. ‚ÄúThis redefines the independence, impartiality and integrity of the judiciary. Has the last bastion fallen?‚Äù he said.

Surjewala also tweeted quoting Arun Jaitley, saying the verdicts are influenced by post-retirement jobs. ‚ÄúDid PM Modi consider the advice of his former colleague and Law Minister and Finance Minister, Late Sh. Arun Jaitley before recommending ex-CJI, Ranjan Gogoi to the Rajya Sabha?‚Äù he said in another tweet.

Another senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal in a tweet accused the former CJI of ‚Äúcompromising his own and the integrity of the institution (SC)‚Äù. He also drew parallels between the ex-CJI and former Justice HR Khanna, saying that the latter is remembered for upholding integrity and standing up to the government.

Justice H R Khanna remembered for : 1) his integrity

2)standing up to govt.

3) upholding rule of law Ranjan Gogoi for lapping up a Rajya Sabha nomination for 1) being saved by govt.

2) standing in line with it

3) compromising his own and the integrity of the institution ‚Äî Kapil Sibal (@KapilSibal) March 17, 2020



Other Opposition leaders including AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi and ex-BJP minister Yashwant Sinha have also questioned the government‚Äôs decision on Gogoi. While Owaisi sought to allege a ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù, Sinha accused Justice Gogoi of causing ‚Äúincalculable damage to the reputation of the judiciary‚Äù.

Is it ‚Äúquid pro quo‚Äù?

How will people have faith in the Independence of Judges ? Many Questions pic.twitter.com/IQkAx4ofSf ‚Äî Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) March 16, 2020



Sinha said, ‚ÄúI hope ex-CJI Ranjan Gogoi would have the good sense to say ‚ÄòNO‚Äô to the offer of Rajya Sabha seat to him. Otherwise, he will cause incalculable damage to the reputation of the judiciary.‚Äù

The terse reaction by Opposition leaders comes after former CJI Ranjan Gogoi was nominated to the Rajya Sabha by President Ram Nath Kovind. A notification announcing his nomination to the Upper House was issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday night.

Gogoi headed benches that pronounced several key judgements including in the Ayodhya land dispute case. He also led the benches that ruled on matters like Rafale fighter jet deal, ordering the NRC in Assam and the entry of women in Sabarimala temple.

Gogoi, 65, retired as CJI in November last year after a tenure of a little over 13 months. He becomes the first former Chief Justice of India to be nominated to Rajya Sabha. Former Chief Justice Ranganath Misra was also a Rajya Sabha member but he was elected on a Congress party ticket.",https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/opposition-sees-red-over-ranjan-gogois-nomination-to-rajya-sabha-leaders-allege-quid-pro-quo/1900334/,

Perspectives on the Indian Economy,"The authors introduce readers to the approach to manufacturing since independence right through the planning process and the period of post-reforms.

There are a lot of encomiums that we tend to associate with India‚Äôs progress. The book, All The Wrong Turns, which takes a look at the past 70 years or so, attempts to correct this misconception. In what can be a valuable read for students of Indian economics and critics alike, the authors argue that we seem to have joblessness growth and quite a bit of uncertainty on many aspects of the economy that are enmeshed in contradictions. The authors deal with issues in separate chapters, with the six as good as little booklets on the subjects of agriculture, manufacturing, foreign trade, fiscal policy, banking and institutions.

A theme that runs through the discourse is the high level of contradictions that we witness in these sectors. In agriculture, for example, there are statistics to show how we are leaders in production of rice, wheat and horticulture products. Yet there is a lot of farm distress, as we have never managed to tie the several loose ends together. A lot of progress made during the Sixties and Seventies, through the Green Revolution, lost steam decades back. Our policies are flawed, as can be seen by the defective approaches of providing free power and, hence, water, which has impacted the environment for generations to come. Overuse of fertilisers and the rather ambivalent approach to using hybrid seeds finds some thought-provoking discussion in this section.

The authors introduce readers to the approach to manufacturing since independence right through the planning process and the period of post-reforms. We have never really witnessed sustained manufacturing growth, which creates jobs and ensures the cycle keeps moving. Why should this be so? Here, the authors take a rather interesting position, where they talk of our rather stodgy approach to public-sector enterprises that are maintained for ideological reasons and where the government does not want to give up control. Second, they also bring to fore the problems with the much-talked about SME segment, which has been given successive incentives, but has never come of age and seems to be stuck with low value-added goods that can never allow it to reach the scale required to bring in sustainable growth. This model works only where they are producing niche products. Also, non-resolution of the two major reforms concerning land and labour has held back this sector.

The analogy for foreign trade provided by the authors is quite appropriate: think of a student who studies very hard and gets 90% marks in the board examination. Yet it is very difficult to get admission at the next stage because all students are doing better. This is our foreign trade situation, where we have a strong base, but we have not really managed to make any major inroad into other markets. India has done very well in services, which include exports, but has not made any major stride in other products where countries like China have gone much ahead.

On the issue of banking, the authors are quite clear about the pain points. They talk of the four major sub sectors that form the superstructure of the system. The RRBs and cooperative banking structures need to be revisited, as they have served little purpose. The DFIs, which did add value and helped create infrastructure in the economy, are now history. The PSBs, which are the largest and critical part, have fallen into the NPA trap due to absence of focus and independence, which was not the case with private banks and which tended to do better.

An interesting feature of PSBs which is highlighted is one of concentration, which increases the risk, as they all have a common business focus, which can be due to common ownership where direction is provided. The analogy that best describes this is a boat in stormy weather where 70% of the people in terms of weight all sit on one side and refuse to disperse!

With Raghavan being one of the authors, the Keynesian story is very well explained and he shows how we have incorrectly interpreted the theory. While Keynes spoke of government stepping in when the private sector was not there to invest or spend, we have turned the tables and made the government the driver along with the private sector. The result has been high deficits and continuous overshooting of the targets. This has put severe constraints on monetary policy where accommodation is required.

On institutions, the point made is that those created by the Constitution remain robust, while those done by the Parliament and ministries are not because of the way of funding and appointments. The book is very well written by the two experts and those by Raghavan can be spotted easily due to his fairly acerbic style. The approach followed is quite novel, where historical perspective is provided before getting into a critique. The former should help the students, while the latter will appeal to the practitioners. Either way, it should find space on your bookshelf.

Personal ambition played major part in Jyotiraditya Scindia‚Äôs decision: Adhir Chowdhury,"‚ÄúIt is sad news for the Congress party because Jyotiraditya Scindia had been nurtured by the party over the years,‚Äù Chowdhury told PTI. (ANI Image)

Congress leader Adhir Chowdhury on Tuesday said ideology did not matter to Jyotiraditya Scindia, and claimed that ‚Äúpolitical convenience‚Äù and ‚Äúpersonal ambition‚Äù played a major part his decision to quit the party.

Chowdhury alleged that some sort of ‚Äúallurement and enticement‚Äù offered by the Bharatiya Janata Party had convinced Scindia for switching over from the Congress.

‚ÄúIt is sad news for the Congress party because Jyotiraditya Scindia had been nurtured by the party over the years,‚Äù Chowdhury told PTI.

‚ÄúHe had been entrusted with important jobs by the party. But now the situation had come to such a pass that he found it more convenient to switch over to the other party,‚Äù Chowdhury said.

In a massive setback for the Congress, Scindia quit the party, pushing the Kamal Nath government in Madhya Pradesh into virtual collapse and signalling that he is likely to join hands with the BJP.

The Congress expelled the party general secretary and scion of the erstwhile Gwalior royal family on charges of anti-party activities.

Earlier the morning, Scindia met BJP leader and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, following which he called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his residence in Delhi.

‚ÄúSome sort of allurement, enticement offered by the BJP had convinced him for switching over,‚Äù Chowdhury said. ‚ÄúNow he has become the asset of the BJP party.‚Äù

The leader of Congress in Lok Sabha claimed that ideology had no meaning for Scindia because if it had mattered, he would not have left the Congress.

‚ÄúIt is simply political convenience and personal ambition, which have played a major part in his decision,‚Äù Chowdhury added.",https://www.financialexpress.com/india-news/personal-ambition-played-major-part-in-jyotiraditya-scindias-decision-adhir-chowdhury/1894064/,
"On track! UP-defence corridor to generate 2.5 lakh jobs, land acquisition begins","The government would soon create a land bank of 25,000 acres to facilitate setting up of industries on the corridor, the CM said. (File photo)

With the Uttar Pradesh government starting to acquire land at four nodes, the much-touted UP-Defence Corridor (UPDC) project has got off the ground. Announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the UP Investors Summit in February 2018, the infrastructure corridor is estimated to attract investments of Rs 20,000 crore in the arid Bundelkhand region and create employment for 2.5 lakh people. According to Awanish Kumar Awasthi, Additional Chief Secretary & CEO, Uttar Pradesh Expressways Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA), the nodal agency for the defence corridor, land for the flagship project is being acquired in two phases. ‚ÄúAlmost 3,788 hectares of land is to be acquired across 4 nodes as part of Phase I, out of which over 1,455 hectares has been identified in Jhansi, Kanpur, Chitrakoot and Aligarh. Of this, around 1,200 hectares has already been acquired, mainly in Jhansi, Aligarh and Chitrakoot,‚Äù he says.

While Lucknow, Jhansi, Chitrakoot, Aligarh, Kanpur and Agra were proposed as the six nodes of the defence corridor project, the interest it has evoked saw the UP government notify another three nodes for investment: Meerut, Ghaziabad and Gautam Buddha Nagar. The project is being implemented in Bundelkhand given the availability of cheap land and the existence of a strong ancillary base in the region. It is one of the two defence corridors being built to meet the modernisation needs of the Indian armed forces, with the second one coming up in Tamil Nadu.

‚ÄúIt would promote indigenisation and support the Make in India initiative, helping meet equipment requirements worth over $250 billion by 2025. It would also promote ancillarisation and development of MSMEs for the Aerospace & Defence (A&D) sector, making UP a preferred destination for the purpose and boosting India‚Äôs defence exports,‚Äù says a UPEIDA official.

At the recently concluded DefExpo 2020 in Lucknow, 23 companies signed MoUs worth Rs 50,000 crore with the state government for investment in the defence corridor. At the event, Ancor Research Labs became the first investor in the corridor, being allotted 25 acres of land in the Aligarh node to create high-end defence testing facilities and manufacture defence grade communication systems.

Speaking after presenting the state‚Äôs budget for 2020-21 more recently, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said the project would serve as a springboard for the state turning into a $1-trillion economy by 2024, as the government had proposed. The government would soon create a land bank of 25,000 acres to facilitate setting up of industries on the corridor, the CM said. ‚ÄúUP‚Äôs aim is to become a net exporter; even if half of the MoUs that were signed at the DefExpo are realised, we will be able to generate employment for 2.5 lakh people,‚Äù he said.

Among the investment avenues on the corridor are defence parks at Jhansi, Agra, and Kanpur; aerospace parks at Lucknow, Kanpur, and Agra; leather and textile hubs at Agra; and engineering/electronics manufacturing hubs at Agra, Kanpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar and Ghaziabad. To attract investors, the UP government has offered major incentives in its Defence & Aerospace Policy 2018, including reimbursement of 25% of land cost, transportation subsidy, and reimbursement of 75% of the cost of technology transfer to anchor units. It has roped in IIT-BHU and IIT-Kanpur as knowledge partners to conduct research and help train manpower for industrial units in the defence sector.",https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/on-track-up-defence-corridor-to-generate-2-5-lakh-jobs-land-acquisition-begins/1892733/,
"International Women‚Äôs Day: Some women activists call PM Modi‚Äôs gesture amazing, others say it‚Äôs attention seeking move","In a series of tweets, Modi said India has outstanding women achievers in all parts of the nation. (File image)

Some women activists saw Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs decision to hand over his social media accounts to women as an ‚Äúamazing initiative‚Äù to honour ‚Äúreal and not reel‚Äù women, while others called it an attention seeking move aimed to divert attention from issues plaguing the country. On the occasion of Women‚Äôs Day, Modi said ‚Äúseven women achievers‚Äù will share their life journey through his social media accounts on Sunday. Activist Monica Arora, who is the national convenor of Group of Intellectuals and Academicians, called it a move to honour the ‚Äúreal woman‚Äù who are ‚Äúserving humanity‚Äù on the ground.

‚ÄúThe selection of women has been amazing. A girl who has only 2000 followers on social media was chosen but she has been running a food bank for more than five years and feeding thousands and thousands of people. So the prime minister is honouring real woman and not reel women,‚Äù she said. She said these were the women who were making a difference and serving humanity on the ground and added that the selection has been amazing. ‚ÄúAnother woman is a bomb blast survivor. She is such a motivation. She is a person making a difference to the world. It shows you are making a difference to the world in whatever capacity you can that empowers women irrespective of caste or religion or age. It is very good,‚Äù Arora said. Shilpa Puranik, member of NGO Bhartiya Srishakti said social media brought different kinds of people together which made it a good platform to spread awareness and that was what the prime minister did by handing over his social media platforms to inspirational women.

‚ÄúI appreciate his decision because it is important to create awareness on social media about women empowerment,‚Äù she said. However, some activists called it an ‚Äúattention seeking‚Äù move through which he wants to distract people from issues plaguing the country. Rights activist and CPI leader Annie Raja said if the prime minister is truly concerned about women empowerment, he should take steps against the rising cases of sexual harassment and abuse. ‚ÄúHe should announce that women reservation bill has been passed on Women‚Äôs Day. It is a distraction from talking about real issues. He should realise women will not be fooled,‚Äù she said.

All India Progressive Women‚Äôs Association secretary Kavita Krishnan called it a ‚Äúgimmick‚Äù and an ‚Äúattempt by Modi to make himself the story again‚Äù at a time when his government is being criticised for the Delhi riots and the citizenship law. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the women of Shaheen Bagh, activists like Sudha Bharadwaj, Gauri Lankesh who need to be the story ‚Äî not Modi‚Äôs grandiose gestures,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI respect the women who have been handed over the accounts but I want to request them that when you have access to his accounts for one day then please do the favour of unfollowing all the trolls and abusive accounts. He wouldn‚Äôt do it himself so please you do it,‚Äù she said. Shabnam Hashmi, a women rights activist, called it a ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and said women‚Äôs condition has worsened under his government. ‚ÄúIt is all a new drama. There are lakhs of women who have lost their jobs. It is an attention seeking move because you can‚Äôt answer what is happening in the country. Women have become much worse off then what they were six years ago,‚Äù she said. Extending greetings on International Women‚Äôs Day, Prime Minister said ‚ÄúAs I‚Äôd said a few days ago, I‚Äôm signing off.‚Äù ‚ÄúThrough the day, seven women achievers will share their life journeys and perhaps interact with you through my social media accounts,‚Äù he said.

In a series of tweets, Modi said India has outstanding women achievers in all parts of the nation. ‚ÄúThese women have done great work in a wide range of sectors. Their struggles and aspirations motivate millions. Let us keep celebrating the achievements of such women and learning from them,‚Äù he said. Modi had on Tuesday said he will be handing over his accounts on various social media platforms to women who inspire. The prime minister has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. He is one of the most-followed world leaders on social media with 53.3 million followers on Twitter, 44 million on Facebook and 35.2 million on Instagram. The Twitter handle of the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office has 32 million followers. In September 2019, Modi was the third-most followed world leader on the microblogging site, behind only US President Donald Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama. The prime minister was the first Indian to cross the 50-million followers mark on Twitter.",https://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/international-womens-day-some-women-activists-call-pm-modis-gesture-amazing-others-say-its-attention-seeking-move/1892577/,
"India‚Äôs decision not to join RCEP unfortunate, says Montek Singh Ahluwalia","Former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia with deputy associate editor Udit Misra in The Indian Express newsroom (Image:- Abhinav Saha)

UDIT MISRA: Did the Planning Commission overstay its welcome?

Many of my friends thought that it was a contradiction of sorts for someone associated with liberalisation to become deputy chairman of the Planning Commission. I used to make the point that they had no idea of what the Planning Commission does‚Ä¶ It never engaged in detailed direct control. It was always an advisory body. But it did change quite a bit over time. The main task we had, which was effectively executive, was to divide the total development expenditure for the Centre and states‚Ä¶This resource allocation role was much emphasised but I felt that the real job of the Planning Commission should be to push for new policy initiatives‚Ä¶.

UDIT MISRA: What is your opinion of the role played by the NITI Aayog?

I don‚Äôt have good knowledge of it, but I believe that they have no role to play in financial decisions, and that is unfortunate because part of the usefulness of the five-year planning process is that it introduces discipline. Even big corporations have budget processes that are multi-years. Currently, it is not being performed by the NITI Aayog. You could argue that it is being performed by the finance ministry. But I don‚Äôt think it is a good idea because the ministry has a core job, which is to keep fiscal deficit under control‚Ä¶.

UDIT MISRA: Isn‚Äôt it true that many of the issues that the economy is facing at present are because of the UPA government not undertaking any significant economic reforms?

In a competitive political environment, political parties will put across facts in whatever manner suits them. Let‚Äôs look objectively at what accounted for high growth in the UPA period? There is no doubt that the tremendous reforms initiated in 1991, which were also continued by the United Front and Vajpayee governments, produced an image of continuity and broad consensus which helped generate a pro-investment climate.

The Vajpayee government contributed to this. His openness to FDI was a continuation but it was a new signal from the BJP which had many segments opposed to FDI.

Second, he signalled going beyond disinvestment to genuine privatisation‚Ä¶ The United Front was the first to recognise that government equity could go below 51% but they didn‚Äôt do it‚Ä¶ The Vajpayee government was the first to say that they were willing to reduce government equity to 26%. Arun Shourie led the charge with some genuine privatisation but it got embroiled in controversy.

Then came the UPA government. They took many initiatives that ignited private investment. Manmohan Singh‚Äôs presence was the best signal that could be sent out to the private sector that the government intended to stimulate private investment. The sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit in the first four years clearly helped create room for private investment to expand.

UDIT MISRA: Many argue that there was too much stress on welfare, and while the government created fiscal space, it also gave it up around 2008.

The notion that we created space and then gave it up for welfarism is just not true. Otherwise, the fiscal deficit would not have fallen. Besides I don‚Äôt believe that the MGNREGA was as negative as people think.The MGNREGA is a mechanism for building assets in rural areas‚Ä¶ One of the big things that Mihir Shah (formerly a member of the Commission) and I were pushing for was that we should use the MGNREGA for programmes for water conservation. NGOs were opposed to it because they felt that the projects should be determined by panchayats. So we struck a balance.

The other major steps that were taken were reform-oriented. One was expanding the scope of FDI, both in airlines and telecom. Then there was FDI in insurance, which required legislation and the BJP opposed it. I am glad that when they came to power, they promptly did it.

The GST is another example. The idea was first announced in Parliament in 2005 by P Chidambaram. But then it was stopped again by the BJP, mainly by states such as Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh‚Ä¶.

UDIT MISRA: There were also a lot of rights-based schemes such as Right to Education that were introduced. But what about larger structural points such as corporate tax cut, which has happened only now. Why wasn‚Äôt it done when there was fiscal space?

Can one object to Right to Education? The real problem is that we never recognised what institutional flexibility is needed to deliver Right to Education. And that is a fair criticism. But that is very difficult and we are not doing it now either. The only area where the government should have acted and didn‚Äôt is labour. And that is for the same reason why the central government is not doing it now. Historically, there has been large representation of organised labour in major parties. The opposition of organised labour to labour reforms was enormous.

SUNIL JAIN: Knowing about the twin balance sheet problem, if you were to do it again, would you push bank lending and boost infrastructure without carrying out reforms?

While we were certainly pushing growth, we were not directly pushing bank lending. When growth occurs, there is an enthusiasm; people borrow and banks lend‚Ä¶ If you start trying to do everything, nothing will happen. The logic of change is to go ahead and push; watch out what the problem is and try and correct it‚Ä¶ In 2014, when Raghuram Rajan was the RBI governor, he recognised the problem‚Ä¶ He was criticised for unnecessarily creating difficulties. Frankly, this issue had emerged in 2014-15‚Ä¶ The Economic Survey at that time talked about what we have to do ‚Äî we should recognise the problem, that was done; we had to recapitalise banks, that was done but only partially; and we had to reform banks so that they don‚Äôt behave in the same way. That reform never happened and that was a pity.

UDIT MISRA: Since liberalisation, we have seen governments of all hues, but there seems to be continuity in terms of the broad economic strategy. Does India have only one economic ideology?

The strength of India depends upon a perception that there is a broad consensus on what is good policy. If the picture portrayed is one of competition between two opposed ideologies, with policy reversals after every change of government, you can assume that we will just be stuck. Right up to the Vajpayee government and then the UPA government, that is certainly the image. Now, some people might criticise the present government for continuing the UPA programmes while renaming them‚Ä¶ Continuity, with renaming making it catchier is fine. On the other hand, I don‚Äôt think that continuity is being really maintained because there has been an increase in Customs duty in the last two-three years‚Ä¶ It is possible that we are reacting to a perception that the old stuff about lowering duties is old-fashioned, and the new economics is that we should have higher protection. I personally think it is a mistake. I also think the decision not to join the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a proposed free trade agreement in Asia-Pacific) was very unfortunate. The government initially said that we must go beyond ‚ÄòLook East‚Äô, and ‚ÄòAct East‚Äô. But refusing to join the RCEP is not Acting East, it is in fact sitting on the shore and saying no thank you very much.

UDIT MISRA: Do you think the Congress had the ability to push reforms?

The 1991 reform was carried out by a coalition government led by the Congress ‚Äî Narasimha Rao provided the political leadership and Manmohan Singh was the economic architect. They undid an enormous amount of traditional Congress policies. If we could do it in 1991, why can‚Äôt we do it again?‚Ä¶ Admittedly, it is easy to take tough steps in the face of a crisis if you can say that it was caused by somebody else. The experience of 1991 suggests that parties, in this case the Congress, can be persuaded to move in new directions. Not everybody in the top leadership of the party in 1991 was willing to go along, but the changes were made‚Ä¶ If there are things that need to be done, they should be done.

PRABHA RAGHAVAN: With India having initiated a review of its existing free trade agreements (FTAs), what bearing do you think it will have on ongoing talks with other nations?

A lot of this desire to scrap FTAs is based on many lobbies arguing that our FTAs have not benefited us. The latest Economic Survey does an analysis of FTAs and says that‚Äôs not true. The first thing one has to ask is whether the Economic Survey is right or wrong? I believe that the Economic Survey is right. If the Economic Survey is right, then the whole argument against FTAs is false.

ISHAN BAKSHI: Is it time to review the macroeconomic framework that has governed India‚Äôs policies for the last two decades?

We should always review macroeconomics periodically. A key question is, are we on target in macroeconomic terms? We are not. We no longer have growth targets but the government has set the goal of becoming a $5 trillion economy by 2024-25. This requires a growth rate of almost 9%. We are going to end the financial year (2019-20) at 5% or a little less. And next year, may be a little above 5%. At this rate we are not going to get a 9% average unless the growth rate in the remaining four years is well above 10% or so, which is not going to happen.

There is also no chance of achieving the targeted doubling of farm income over a five-year period between 2015-16 and 2021-22. So we do need to revise our expectations and set realistic targets.

SUNNY VERMA: How fair is it for the current government to blame the UPA for the mess in the banking sector? Also, with the economy struggling, what would be your advice to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman?

It should be accepted that periods of rapid growth are accompanied by excess bank lending. This is a common phenomenon. When growth occurs, private capitalists become excessively optimistic. There is no harm in banks supporting enthusiastic investors if they bring enough of their own equity, but this doesn‚Äôt happen. At the end of a boom, there is a downturn and the economy slows down. A lot of projects aren‚Äôt able to service their debt. So the banking sector gets stressed. But how long should that stress last? Six years?‚Ä¶ I feel what has happened is that while the problem was clearly identified, corrective steps were not taken.

When it comes to reform of the banking system, it has still not been undertaken. Reform is not something which is done instantly. If you go back to 1991, a lot of reforms were carried out in the financial system‚Ä¶ and these took four-five years. The next step was to open up the domestic capital market and the capital account in a cautious manner. And then opening up insurance. This was politically not easy but it was done. We now need to focus on reform of the banks. The PJ Nayak Committee recommendations should be implemented. The GST also needs to be fixed.

UDIT MISRA: Is current Indian politics economy proof?

I agree that the economy is under considerable stress‚Ä¶ most felt in the lack of creation of job opportunities. Young graduates are looking for much better jobs than their parents had. And unless the economy performs differently, they‚Äôll get frustrated soon. Populism, in the sense of saying that ‚ÄòYou are not getting a job, but I‚Äôm giving you benefits‚Äô, is totally unsustainable because it is unaffordable. So it will reflect itself in the government borrowing excessively, directly or indirectly, which will only squeeze out the private sector and make the jobs crisis worse‚Ä¶ The notion that you can ignore the economic side and rely on populism is just not viable.

UDIT MISRA: Did the public reaction to demonetisation surprise you?

It was very disruptive, but it is true that it was politically well sold and people did not seem to mind it. They minded the loss of jobs etc, but somehow the political management of demonetisation was such that it was accepted.

RAVISH TIWARI: Where do you think the UPA-II lost the plot?

There are two things that the UPA-II did not do. First, they did not adequately explain to people that the UPA-II had substantial achievements, particularly the reduction in percentages in absolute numbers of poverty as of 2011-12. So it was not just in the UPA-I. I have no answer why they were unable to project these achievements‚Ä¶ The PM did mention them. Even Sonia Gandhi mentioned them in some of her speeches. Somehow, it was not part of the dominant political discourse‚Ä¶ One of the biggest achievements of the UPA was in the area of health. Polio got eliminated. The director-general of the WHO came to India and made the announcement just before the (general) elections (of 2014)‚Ä¶ Particularly because the Congress was so concerned about education and health, this should have been trumpeted from the rooftops‚Ä¶

The second was the public perception that corruption had reached impossible levels. There were many factors ‚Äî the Anna Hazare movement, mobilisation by NGOs.

Corruption is a problem everywhere. It is not as if India is the only corrupt country in the world. But the way the whole thing was managed, the UPA never got around to making its case that it is being tarred unfairly by a particular brush.

My suspicion is that they did not actually appreciate the fact that social media or new methods of communication ‚Äî Twitter, Instagram, Facebook ‚Äî have shifted the arena where these issues are discussed. And they paid the price for that.

UDIT MISRA: Can you think of examples in the past when the Reserve Bank was able to display independence?

The RBI is not legally independent since the law allows the government to intervene if it wishes. However, it has been able to preserve a high degree of independence in the past. This is exemplified by the case of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in the early 1980s. The BCCI was lobbying hard to get a banking licence but the RBI had reservations. The Finance Ministry felt the presence of the BCCI would send a positive signal to investors and it sought to overcome the RBI‚Äôs unwillingness by getting the Cabinet to approve a proposal that the power to allow a foreign bank to operate should lie with the Finance Ministry, although the RBI could continue to supervise the functioning of the bank once it started operation.This proposal was approved by the Cabinet, but Manmohan Singh, who was the governor of the RBI at the time, took up the matter with prime minister Indira Gandhi. He explained that it would seriously damage the credibility of the RBI as an institution, and if the government insisted on implementing it, he would have to resign. After hearing him, the PM actually reversed the Cabinet decision and the withdrawal of powers was never implemented. This is an example of preserving effective independence of the institution. Singh has written about this in a little-known article.

The RBI‚Äôs reservations were amply justified by subsequent revelations of money-laundering and illegal activities unearthed by US authorities which led to the collapse of the bank. It exemplified the potential conflict between a proactive developmental approach and a regulator‚Äôs risk mitigation approach.",https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/indias-decision-not-to-join-rcep-unfortunate-says-montek-singh-ahluwalia/1892090/,
Textile exports from nearly 15 states shrink in last five years; these states see maximum contraction,"From Delhi, the textile exports halved from $542 mn in FY15 to a mere $270 in FY19 while in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, the contraction was on account of 20% and 16% respectively. (Bloomberg image)

As India‚Äôs textile sector aimed to grab an opportunity amid the US-China trade war, the textile exports from around 15 states contracted in the last five years. In FY15, the textile exports from many states including Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh, and Delhi were more than what they were in FY19, according to a written reply given by Textile Minister Smriti Irani in Lok Sabha. From Delhi, the textile exports halved from $542 mn in FY15 to a mere $270 in FY19 while in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh, the contraction was on account of 20 per cent and 16 per cent respectively.

The overall exports in the textile sector grew at a much slower pace than the imports grew in the last five years. The textile exports rose 2.2 per cent while textile imports shot up by 13.1 per cent between FY15 and FY19, according to the parliament papers.

The textile industry is a labour-intensive industry thus the growth plays a vital role in job creation. The textile industry is also one of the industries that have major participation from the informal sector as well. Hence, a fall in the industry causes loss of jobs from the informal sector that is hardly measured. However, the government had earlier said that to curtail imports of textiles and to boost domestic production, it has doubled the Basic Customs Duty from 10 per cent to 20 per cent on 383 apparel HS lines from 16 July 2018.",https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/textile-exports-from-nearly-15-states-shrink-in-last-five-years-these-states-see-maximum-contraction/1891848/,
"WIAA Women‚Äôs Rally to the Valley: Meet the drivers ‚Äì Navy squadron leader, 78-year-old grandma & a 100 more","The 2020 edition Women‚Äôs Rally to the Valley has some very intriguing entries and we had a chance to meet some of them before the rally kicks off on Sunday morning.

Western India Automobile Association (WIAA) is set to flag off the 2020 Women‚Äôs Rally to the Valley tomorrow from the NCPA in Mumbai. We witnessed the rally up close last year and we will be at the flag-off and at the finish line in Aamby Valley City this year as well. The 2020 edition has some very intriguing entries and we had a chance to meet some of them before the rally kicks off. Meet the drivers that include rally racers, entries from Airforce, Maharashtra Police, a Navy squadron leader, and an 89-year-old grandmother.

Beginning with Mrs Rajkumari Kasliwal. The 78-year-old participant will be accompanied by her granddaughter who will act as the navigator. Kasliwal tells us that her team hasn‚Äôt gone for any thematic decorations for their car because they‚Äôre only in for the drive. And we adore her for the fact that driving is very important to her. Called ‚ÄòHighway Driver‚Äô with love, Kasliwal does long-distance driving every now and then. She says she only has one hesitation for the rally tomorrow, she‚Äôs used to doing speeds of over 100 km/h on highways and slowing right down for the TSD-format rally will be a challenge. This made us respect her even more. And the award for the coolest grandmum goes to.

Moving on to Squadron Leader Nishtha Pathak, Lieutenant Karuna Jaiswal, and Jyotsna Bhatia. The soft-spoken women clearly have more important jobs than you and I. But to our benefit, they have a love for driving as well. We just had one question for them, if their kids one day come to them saying they want to become professional racers ‚Äì what would be their reaction as parents? The three unanimously said they would gladly support it. Now, that is the brilliant change WIAA is helping to bring about.

And now about the two shining beacons that will head the rally. Professional racer and Indigo flight commander Sneha Sharma will be driving the first car of the rally again this year. In our conversation with her, Sharma tells us that she applauds the efforts made by the WIAA to put women behind the wheel and empowering them. Sharma also takes part in road safety campaigns that WIAA conducts every now and then. Sneha Sharma is the fastest female driver on the Formula LGB 4 circuit of the JK Tyre FMSCI National Racing Championship. She flies the Airbus 320 for Indigo and is also an F3 simulator driver.

There will be another Formula race car driver participating in the rally tomorrow ‚Äì Diana Pundole. She has completed a number of races in the JK Tyre FMSCI National Racing Championship LBG Formula 4W category. Between races, Diana also takes on the role of a driving instructor for Mercedes-Benz India.

ESIC scheme to give cash relief to insured persons during unemployment,"Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) Wednesday approved a new scheme which would pay cash relief to insured persons during the period of unemployment, the Labour Ministry said.

The scheme, Atal Bimit Vyakti Kalyan Yojna, is a relief payable in cash directly to Bank Account of insured person in case of unemployment and while they search for new engagement, Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said.

The scheme would benefit insured persons (IP) covered under the Employees‚Äô State Insurance Act, 1948. It has been formed considering the change in employment pattern and the current scenario of employment in India which has transformed from a long term employment to fixed short term engagement in the form of contract and temporary, the ministry said.

The proposal scheme was approved Wednesday in the ESIC board meeting chaired by the labour minister.

Detailed instructions including eligibility conditions, application format, etc. will be issued separately.

The ESIC has also approved the proposal for reimbursement of Rs 10 per person to the employers to encourage the seeding of Aadhaar (UID) in ESIC database of their workers and their family members. It will curtail the multiple registrations of same Insured Persons and thus enable them to avail the benefits requiring longer contributory conditions.

The ESIC also approved the proposal for relaxing eligibility conditions for availing Super Specialty treatment from earlier insurable employment of 2 years to 6 months with contribution requirement of only 78 days.

Besides, the eligibility for availing Super Specialty treatment for dependants of Insured Person has now been relaxed to insurable employment of one year with 156 days of contributions. This relaxation will immensely help the Insured Persons and their beneficiaries to avail Super Specialty treatment free of cost as per revised eligibility, it added.

The ESIC has approved the proposal for increasing the funeral expenses from existing Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 being paid on the death of Insured Person.

"Unemployment reason behind rise of Modi, Trump: Rahul","The people around the world are electing leaders like Narendra Modi and Donald Trump due to frustration over growing unemployment, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said today while acknowledging that his party lost the 2014 polls as it failed to create enough jobs. Gandhi, 47, who is in the US on a two-week-long tour, during his interaction with students at the prestigious Princeton University said employment was an all-encompassing means to empower, enfranchise and involve Indians in the nation building process.

‚ÄúI think, the central reason why Mr Modi rose and to an extent why Mr Trump came, is the question of jobs in India and in the United States. There‚Äôs a large part of our populations that simply do not have jobs and cannot see a future. And, so they are feeling pain. And they have supported these type of leaders,‚Äù Gandhi said.

He said the another problem is that nobody was recognising that unemployment was a problem.

‚ÄúI do not know Trump. I don‚Äôt go there. But, certainly our prime minister is not doing enough (in creating jobs),‚Äù said the Congress leader.

Gandhi has repeatedly raised the issue of joblessness during his meetings with experts, business leaders and Congressmen in the US.

‚ÄúCurrently, we are not producing enough jobs. 30,000 new youngsters are joining the job market every single day and yet the government is only creating 500 jobs a day. And this doesn‚Äôt include the massive pool of already unemployed youngsters,‚Äù Gandhi had said in his earlier address at the University of California in Berkeley.

At Princeton, Gandhi said India needed to transform itself to compete with China and for that the people in the country required jobs.

‚ÄúThose same people who got angry with us because we couldn‚Äôt deliver on those 30,000 jobs (a day) are going to get angry with Mr Modi. The central question is resolving that problem. My main issue with Mr Modi is that he diverts that issue and points the finger somewhere else instead of saying listen we have a problem,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúThere is anger building up in India right now. We can sense it. So to me the challenge is how to solve that job growth problem in a democratic environment. That‚Äôs the challenge,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúSo we have to first accept it as a problem. Then we have to unite and try to solve it. Right now, nobody is even accepting it as a problem,‚Äù he argued.

Focusing a major part of his question and answer session at Princeton on jobs, Gandhi asserted that new technologies and modernisation are unlikely to kill jobs.

‚ÄúThe nature of what we call it a blue collar job is going to change. But the question is who is going to have those jobs and which countries are going to have access to those jobs,‚Äù he said.

He also raised the issue of polarisation in India.

He said that the politics of polarisation was central challenge in India and some sections of the society, including the minority communities and tribal people, do not feel a part of the ruling BJP‚Äôs vision.

‚ÄúIn the 21st century, if you leave some people out of your vision, you are asking for trouble. New ideas would come, new different visions would develop. So, to me, central challenge in India is politics of polarisation where you pit one community against other and you create spaces for other people to come in,‚Äù Gandhi said.

‚ÄúThere is a belt of 100 million tribal people who do not feel comfortable with the vision (of the BJP). There are a number of states in India, which don‚Äôt want a single vision forced down their throat. There are minority communities, they do not feel that they are the part of the vision. So that‚Äôs where the real danger is,‚Äù Gandhi said in response to a question.

India‚Äôs strength has always been its ability to embrace people, he said.

Disruption of harmony ‚Äúis the central risk that India is facing,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúIndia lives in a volatile neighbourhood. And if we alienate our own people, that creates space for people to do mischief. I do not need to name who those people are, but it opens up space for them,‚Äù Gandhi said.

‚ÄúLeaving hundreds of millions of people outside that vision is not a good idea, because other people will start to create problems,‚Äù Gandhi said.

Responding to a question on uniform civil code, Gandhi said it is for the court to decide.

‚ÄúI have faith in the courts of our country,‚Äù he said.

If he was given the reins of the Congress party, Gandhi said a large part of his work would be to create a new vision of India for the next 10 years.

That vision, he said, would focus on how to solve the job problem. It will also focus on agriculture, education and healthcare.",https://rstv.nic.in/unemployment-reason-behind-rise-modi-trump-rahul.html,
Underemployment more serious than unemployment: Niti Aayog,"‚ÄúSevere underemployment‚Äù and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, says the government‚Äôs policy think tank Niti Aayog.

This assertion comes amid Congress‚Äôs criticism of the Narendra Modi government over creating lesser jobs.

In its draft three-year action agenda report for 2017-18 to 2019-20, the Niti Aayog stressed on the need for creation of high-productivity and high-wage jobs.

‚ÄúIndeed, unemployment is the lesser of India‚Äôs problems. The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment. A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,‚Äù it said.

The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the Niti Aayog on April 23.

Contrary to some assertions that India‚Äôs growth has been jobless, the Employment Unemployment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which till date remain the most reliable sources of information on the country‚Äôs employment situation, have consistently reported low and stable rates of unemployment over more than three decades, it said.

Citing examples, the Niti Aayog said as per NSSO survey, in 2011-12, 49 per cent of the workforce was employed in agriculture but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP at current prices.

Second in 2010-11, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India‚Äôs manufacturing workforce but contributed only 12 per cent of manufacturing output, it said.

According to 2006-07 NSSO survey of service firms, the 650 largest enterprises accounted for 38 per cent of services output but only employed two per cent of service workers.

‚ÄúPut another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the work force but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,‚Äù the report said.

Citing the example of China‚Äôs ageing work force, the Niti Aayog stressed on attracting big firms working in that country to India which has availability of large workers at competitive wages.

‚ÄúThe experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers.

‚ÄúThe ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,‚Äù it said.

The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many large-scale firms in labour-intensive sectors currently manufacturing in that country are looking for lower-wage locations.

‚ÄúWith its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,‚Äù the report said.",https://rstv.nic.in/underemployment-serious-unemployment-niti-aayog.html,
12.67 Lakh New Jobs Created In December: ESIC Payroll Data,"Around 12.67 lakh jobs were created in December 2019 against 14.59 lakh in the previous month, according to payroll data of the Employees‚Äô State Insurance Corporation (ESIC). Gross enrolments of new subscribers with ESIC were 1.49 crore during the entire financial year 2018-19, the National Statistical Office (NSO) said in a report.

The report also showed that during the September 2017-December 2019 period, around 3.50 crore new subscribers joined the ESIC scheme. The NSO‚Äôs report is based on the payroll data of new subscribers of various social security schemes run by ESIC, retirement fund body EPFO and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).

It has been releasing the payroll data or new subscribers data of these three bodies since April 2018, covering a period starting from September 2017. The report showed that gross new enrolments with the ESIC during the September 2017-March 2018 period were 83.35 lakh.

A net of 10.08 lakh new enrolments with the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) were recorded in December 2019, compared with 10.09 lakh in November last year.

In 2018-19, 61.12 lakh new subscribers on a net basis joined the social security schemes run by EPFO. Similarly, the net new enrolments were 15.52 lakh during September 2017-March 2018.

The latest data showed that during September 2017-December 2019, around 3.12 crore new subscribers joined the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Scheme.

The report said that since the number of subscribers are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive.

The NSO said the report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level.

"Delhi polls: Congress promises unemployment allowance, cashback schemes, free electricity up to 300 units","The Congress on Sunday promised to implement unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000-7,500 per month, cashback schemes for water and power consumers and challenge the contentious CAA in the Supreme Court if voted to power in Delhi.

The manifesto presented by Delhi Congress chief Subhash Chopra also committed to spend 25 per cent budget each year on fighting pollution and improving transport facilities.

The party has promised to provide free electricity up to 300 units per month.

He said the Congress will open 100 Indira Canteens in the city to give subsidised meals at Rs 15, Chopra said.

An unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000 for graduates and Rs 7,500 for post graduates will be provided monthly under the Yuva Swabhiman Yojna, he said.

The announcements come in the backdrop of promises and initiatives by its rivals AAP and BJP.

The Congress will challenge the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in the Supreme Court and demand the Centre to withdraw the law. The party will also not implement the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the existing form of the National Population Register (NPR), if voted to power in Delhi.

The manifesto, titled ‚ÄòAisi Hogi Hamari Delhi‚Äô, was released at the Delhi Congress office in presence of senior leaders Anand Sharma, manifesto committee chairman Ajay Maken, Rajiv Gowda, Sharmishtha Mukherjee among others.

‚ÄúWe will get a strong Lokpal in first six months,‚Äù Chopra said.

The Congress will launch flagship cashback schemes for power and water supply to benefit consumers saving these resources.

If voted to power, the Congress will launch Sheila Pension Yojna under which Rs 5,000 per month will be provided to senior citizens, persons with disabilities and transgender.

The manifesto also promised opening of a ‚ÄòYaari Startup Incubation Fund‚Äô of Rs 5,000 crore to incentivise entrepreneurs.

A major focus area of the manifesto is pollution mitigation and boosting public transport.

‚ÄúWe will now make Delhi India‚Äôs first electric vehicle city via DEVI-Delhi Electric Vehicles Initiative,‚Äù stated the manifesto, promising procurement of 15,000 electric buses.

It also stated that fares of the Delhi Metro will be subsidised for women, students and senior citizens. For students, a subsidy of Rs 300 per month will be given through direct benefit transfer.

The manifesto also cited a scheme proposed by party leader Rahul Gandhi in the last Lok Sabha election, promising Rs 7,2000 per year to five lakh families.

For women empowerment and safety, the manifesto promised to revive ‚ÄòLadli‚Äô scheme, free education to girls upto PhD and free health check up for women.

Another area of focus in the manifesto is urban renewal and infrastructure promising a 350- square flat for residents of JJ clusters, renewal of TransYamuna Development Board and creation of a Resettlement Colonies Development Board and Shahjahanabad Development Board. These boards will be provided Rs 1,000 crore annually for smooth functioning, it added.

While the BJP has promised to set up a water taxi service between Wazirabad and Sonia Vihar, Jagatpur and Tronica City at affordable prices; free rides for women on DTC buses and subsidised electricity are some of the initiatives taken by the AAP government in Delhi.

The Aam Admi Party is yet to release its manifesto.

Oppn: Issue of unemployment not addressed in Budget,"The Congress on Saturday said the Union budget is lacking in stimulus for growth. The budget does not address the main issue of unemployment and describes the mindset of the government which is ‚Äúall talk and nothing happening‚Äù.

The opposition party said the budget presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman comprises piecemeal measures, repackaged schemes, jugglery of tax slabs, and has no real solutions to solve the economic crisis.

Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has criticised the Budget. He said that there is nothing concrete in it to provide jobs to the youth. Talking to media outside Parliament, he said the budget has a lot of technicalities and repititions.

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav termed the budget as one of the worst in the last decade. He said it has nothing concrete for farmers and unemployed. He also criticised the tax reduction announced today. He questioned how it will benefit people when incomes are decreasing.

NCP leader Supriya Sule said that there is nothing new and substantial in the Budget. She also questioned government for giving credit to Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme for women empowerment. She said the budget has nothing new for the welfare of women.

Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Vinayak Raut also called the budget hopless budget. He alleged that there is no road map for the 5 trillion dollar economy

The Congress, on its official Twitter handle, also said that core sector growth stood at 1.3 per cent in December, despite a significant fall from the same time last year, and budget has failed to lay out a roadmap on how the government plans to address this serious issue.

"All-party meet: Opposition demands debate on unemployment, farm distress","A day before the budget session, an all-party meeting convened by the government was held on Sunday in which the opposition demanded that issues such as farm distress, unemployment and drought should be debated upon in Parliament.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired the meeting, attended by representatives of all parties, including Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Ghulam Nabi Azad, National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah and TMC leader Derek O‚ÄôBrien.

The Prime Minister has called a meeting of chiefs of all parties having representatives in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha on June 19 to discuss ‚Äúone nation, one election‚Äù issue, celebration of 75 years of India‚Äôs Independence in 2022, 150 years of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs birth anniversary this year and issues of ‚Äúaspirational districts‚Äù, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Prahlad Joshi said after the meeting.

He said the PM has also called a meeting of MPs to discuss the issues on June 20.

Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Azad said that all those bills which are in the interest of the people ‚Äúwe are not opposed to them‚Äù.

There should be a discussion on farmers distress, unemployment and drought, he said.

He also called for early conduct of Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, currently under President‚Äôs rule, asserting that if Lok Sabha polls can be held then why not state polls.

It appears that the Centre wants to run the state through the Governor‚Äôs administration, he alleged.

Congress‚Äôs Adhir Ranjan Choudhary and K Suresh were also present at the meeting.

TMC‚Äôs O‚ÄôBrien demanded that the Women‚Äôs Reservation Bill, which seeks to reserve one-third of all seats for women in Lok Sabha and state Assemblies, be brought immediately in the session.

The first session of the newly-constituted 17th Lok Sabha will be held from June 17 to July 26.

"PM Modi counters Opposition on unemployment, economy & other issues","In an exclusive interview to ANI, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked about various issues from employment opportunities to women empowerment and also countered the picture of gloomy economy projected by Opposition.

PM Modi sad that India‚Äôs economy is growing at the fastest pace, how will the employment opportunities not grow? He underlined that FDI inflows are at all time high with India emerging as one of the top hubs for start-ups. Tourism industry got a significant boost with increase in the arrival of foreign tourist by 14 percent last year. PM also cited the historic boom in aviation sector with over 10 crore people took flight last year.

Also under UDAN scheme Tier-II and III cities are put on aviation map. More than 13 crore MUDRA loans have been given to the hardworking entrepreneurs with 3.5 crore of these loans have been given to first time entrepreneurs. Employment generation is also evident from 45 lakh new subscribers in the Employee Provident Fund and 5.68 lakh people joining the New Pension Scheme in the last nine months. Thus, the campaign that jobs have not been created must come to a halt now.

Countering the Opposition‚Äôs claim on GST, PM Modi said that only a few who have been continuously rejected by the masses are making baseless points. They not only want to misguide but also indulge in opposing for the sake of opposing. . It must not be forgotten that people of this country particularly, the business community have supported GST and adopted it whole-heartedly. People have responded positively as it brings lot of benefits to them and to the economy.

The number of enterprises registered from independence until now was 66 lakh. In just one year after the introduction of GST, the number of new enterprises registered is 48 lakh. Around 350 crore invoices were processed and 11 crore returns were filed in 1 year.

Speaking on NRC, PM said that said I want to assure the people that no citizen of India will have to leave the country. As per the due process, all possible opportunities will be given to get their concerns addressed. It is not about politics but about people. Our job in the political class is to work according to the will of the people and do what they have given us the mandate for.

Talking on women empowerment PM Narendra Modi said government is working towards women-led development. ‚ÄòBeti Bachao Beti Padhao‚Äô, was among the first programmes that this government launched aimed at addressing the issues of declining child sex ratio and educating the girl child. This is the first time in the history of independent India that we have two women in the Cabinet Committee on Security ‚Äî the Minister of External Affairs and the Minister for Defence. Women have, for the first time, been inducted as fighter pilots in combat roles in the Indian Air Force.

Through Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) over 13 crore loans have been given of which more than 70% have been given to women. The Triple Talaq bill is in response to a long standing injustice done to Muslim women in India. The Anti-trafficking Bill, that has just been passed by the Lok Sabha.

Asked on his stand on Caste based reservation PM Modi said that our mantra is Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and to achieve this, it is most important to protect the rights of the poor, marginalized, downtrodden, dalits, tribals and OBCs. Look across the length and breadth of India, maximum MPs from SC, ST and OBC communities are from BJP. Maximum MLAs from SC, ST and OBC communities are from BJP.

Responding to loosing allies to BJP, PM Modi said that two events of the recent past will answer your question- the No- Confidence Motion in the Lok Sabha and the election for the Deputy Chairperson of the Rajya Sabha. The outcome of both these events should indicate which coalition is intact and which is falling apart. In fact, we got support even from those parties which are notour allies. BJP has consistently expanded its base over the recent years among the people and welcomed more allies to the NDA family.

When asked about the plans to combat `Mahagathbandhan‚Äô of 2019, PM Modi said that Opposition is well aware of the popularity of the government that have no faith in their ability to fight individually, hence making it an ‚ÄòAll versus One‚Äô fight.

Election after election and in state after state, people are repeatedly choosing the BJP to fulfill their aspirations. People have witnessed firsthand the change in their lives through the efforts of the Central Government. They have also seen that our Government is incorruptible and hard-working.

PM Modi further said that the Mahagathbandhanis for personal survival, not for ideological support. The Mahagathbandhan is for personal ambitions, not for people‚Äôs aspirations. The Mahagathbandhan is purely about power politics, not about people‚Äôs mandate.

The Mahagathbandhan is about dynasties, not about development. The Mahagathbandhan is not about any union of minds or ideas, but about rank opportunism. The only question is whether they will break up before the election or after.

OPINION: Union Budget 2019 & employment creation,"The Union Budget 2019 presented in the Parliament on Friday, the First February has been widely acclaimed as an exercise which has deftly provided benefits and concessions to the farmers, the unorganised labour-force and the middle-class especially at the lower band of the category without imposing any new taxes & levies or raising the rates on the existing. Yet the governmental financial statements for the ensuing fiscal year 2019-20 do not envisage a significant rise in the fiscal-deficit up by a paltry 0.1% of the GDP from the current year‚Äôs 3.3%. Thereby it has virtually silenced the vast number of sceptics who had been asserting that no worthwhile welfare measure in India is conceivable since the Central Government does not have the means to fund them. By assuring significant payouts to about 12 crore farmers and reducing the burden on 3 crore taxpayers, without demanding more from the other citizens, the NDA Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has given credence to the belief that good economics can also be good politics.

A growing criticism of the incumbent NDA government at the Centre has been that while it may have succeeded, during the last four and half years, in putting back on rails the faltering economy of the country, this was achieved without much job-creation. Such fault-finding tends to become more stinging when the powers-that-be are reminded that they had promised, in the 2014 run up to the general elections that when voted to power, their Government would create 2 crore new jobs annually or 10 crore in its five-year term to mid-2019. Whether it has succeeded or not in fulfilling this landmark assurance remains unanswered since official data about the state of employment or unemployment in the country has not been put in the public domain for the last couple of years and the evidence cited to support or criticise is segmental and anecdotal.

A comprehensive official document like the just presented Budget for 2019-20 has also cited only such sectoral data on achievements of the Government in this important arena of economic and social consequences for the year just ending or for all the previous 4 years of the current ruling dispensation. No doubt a budget need not spell out the full state of the economy but this time there was no Economic Survey released by the Government prior to it, a practice usually observed, and which indicates the position on all the economic issues. There were expectations that the Finance Minister‚Äôs Speech would cover such aspects as well. This he no doubt did but only in parts of his otherwise comprehensive statement.

Amongst these were his job-relating references to the ‚Äúhigh growth and formalisation of the economy has led to the expansion of employment opportunities as shown in EPFO membership which has increased by nearly 2 crore in two years reflecting formalisation of the economy and job creations ‚Äú ; ‚Äúwe have harnessed Yuva Shakti through self-employment schemes including MUDRA, Start-Up India and Stand -Up India the concept of employment is changing all over the world, now the employment generation is not confined merely to Government service or factories. With job seekers becoming job creators, India has become the world‚Äôs second largest start-up hub‚Äù. Moving on, the FM also mentioned that the country‚Äôs installed solar generation capacity had grown very rapidly and that it is ‚Äú now creating lakhs of new age jobs‚Äù and the 3 lakh odd Common Service Centres to create digital infrastructure in the villages were reportedly employing 12 lakh jobs.

While these may be the direct touch -points to employment in the Budget, what is important to recognise that for certain major sectors of the economy it has provided several incentives and concessions and these have huge ramifications for job-creation. The real estate industry is amongst these. Amongst these are granting exemption of levy of income tax on notional rent on a second self -occupied home and increasing of the benefit of rollover of capital gains under section 54 of the Income Tax Act from investing in one residential house to two for capital gains up to Rs 2 crore though only once in the lifetime of a taxpayer. On a similar mode, to incentivise the real estate sector, the period of exemption from levy of tax on notional rent on unsold inventories, has been increased from one to two years, from the end of the year in which the project is completed. Yet another measure augmenting the personal taxes to give a boost to affordable housing, the benefits under Section 80-1BA of the IT Act have been extended for one more year viz to the housing projects approved under the new Real Estate Regulation Act (RERA) till 31 st March 2020. The significance of these tax-related measures for giving impetus to the construction industry must be seen in the light of it having huge backward and forward linkages‚Äîan estimate puts it at 248 other economic industries. Needless to remind that Indian construction is hugely labour intensive, though still largely comprised of unorganised labour and it directly provides several million jobs, skilled as well unskilled. Growing it through tax and interest subvention measures, as were initiated in the last year‚Äôs Budget, can be hugely employment-creating.

In addition to the real estate construction industry, the Budget has increased the outlays for the infrastructure sector across all spectrums. This has been done over and above the high budgetary provisions and the actual physical achievements in previous years. Amongst the largest ‚Äòbeneficiaries‚Äô of the governmental focus is the Indian Railways (I.R.)for which is envisaged a life high capital programme of almost Rs. 1.59 lakh crores with Rs 64,587 cr, viz. 21% more than last year coming from the central government. For its capital asset building programme and its huge operating expenditure, the Government also announced the new hiring of 2.8 lakh regular employees in IR. (government jobs like in the railways are highly preferred).

Another rapidly expanding segment of infra -industry and in fact with the most employment -generating potential, is road building. An impressive attainment of 27 km of new roads per day has been reached by the Government and there are intentions of reaching 40 km/day. Realising that the private sector capital and managerial prowess can be once again brought back under its PPP scheme and NHAI is in a position to borrow funds from the open market, the budgetary support has been only marginally hiked up. A part of the needed resources would flow to NHAI from the separate Central Road and Infrastructure Fund, This authority also plans to raise about Rs 15,000 cr by monetising its built roads. Greater focus on inland river transportation as well coastal shipping through higher investments and regulatory easing is expected to open up an altogether new area of employment. FM rightly also drew attention to the large job-openings in the growing civil aviation industry which has seen a double-digit CAGR in the last decade and overseas airlines, aircraft manufacturers and other operators are being attracted into this industry in India. Opening up of Tier 2,3 and now even a few 4 cities under the three UDAAN schemes would see thousands of jobs in airport construction and operations as well in the skies. Ongoing emphasis on transport -infrastructure development thru‚Äô a judicious mix of public and private resources bodes well for the country. As is well known, the rapid interwar period economic and social development in the United States of America was preceded by the building up of a huge network of rail and road across the country.

Conscious that the overwhelming need for job -creation is in the rural areas where almost 65 % of the population continues to reside, the Government- focus in the Budget has rightly moved to agriculture and allied animal husbandry besides fishery-development. Much higher budgetary support through interest subsidy schemes on loans against Kisan credit cards and crop insurance schemes without reducing the existing subsidies on farm- inputs like fertilisers, seeds and insecticides has been promised. The outlay on centrally funded irrigation schemes also stands approved while giving assurances of continuing to raise the MSP for the 22 crops covered last year. All these measures are to be supplemented this year onwards by an annual grant of Rs 6,000, to be paid in 3 equal instalments, to all farmers with holdings below 5 acres of land under the newly launched Pradhan Mantri Kissan Samaan Yojana (PMKSY). This is a most welcome measure which can insulate them against serious natural calamities and crop failures and enable them to buy the inputs for the ensuing crop-season . Many congenital critics might find the amount paltry but given the fact that 12 crore farmers are eligible for this cash dole, it is a good beginning . Once a plan to source additional funding has been firmed up and similar schemes run by states like Telangana and Odisha are aligned with it, the payout to the farmers can be expected to increase.

Building up rural prosperity through direct cash benefit schemes like the new PMKSY is imperative to build the aggregate demand in the country and get the Investment -GDP ratio on its path of rising trend. Bad monsoons and a growing farm production dipping the open market price of produce in normal years had adversely impacted the plight of the farmer in different parts of the country. To alleviate that and help in their march to modernity had called for such proactive steps as initiated in the Budget. With higher disposable incomes, the demand for manufactures and services would grow sharply and reduce the incidence of stagnant capacity -utilisation in the provider- industries. That, in turn, would call for new capacity creation and new investments. As is the global experience, including in India, higher capital-formation results in greater economic growth rates and job creation, both in the organised and informal sector. Going forward we can expect to see that happen soon.

Job creation in the unorganised sector is the key to a happy and contented citizenry. The Budget has rightly seized the opportunity to introduce a pension scheme for 85 odd % of the country‚Äôs workforce. Called the Pradhan Mantri Shram -yogi Maandhaan Yojana ,an assured monthly pension scheme giving Rs 3,000 pm on reaching 60 years of age for all enrolling in the scheme on paying a nominal premium This is more in the nature of a social security measure which will apply to unorganised workers earning less than Rs 15,000 a month. This should help to give emotional and physical security to them and their families as well as reduce the incidence of old age poverty besides making for greater aggregate demand in the economy, a sin qua non for employment creation.

Address the issue of employment: Rahul Gandhi,"Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi asked the government to address the issue of employment.

On a visit to his Lok Sabha constituency Amethi, Rahul said the prime minister should say if he is unable to address the problems like unemployment and the Congress will come and do it in six months.

‚ÄúFarmers and youth are the two main issues concerning India and if Modiji cannot address these, he should say so and the Congress will come and do it in six months,‚Äù he said at a ‚Äòchaupal‚Äô (village gathering) in Kathawra village under Jagdispur area here in Uttar Pradesh.

‚ÄúPrime Minister Narendra Modi needs to stop wasting time of the countrymen and start giving employment to the youth as promised,‚Äù said the Congress leader soon after his arrival here this afternoon on a three-day visit.

‚ÄúThe youth of the country feel they are not getting opportunity to work for the nation‚Ä¶their anger is increasing and‚Ä¶the farmers are committing suicide,‚Äù he said.

Charging the BJP with ignoring schemes like food park and others projects meant for the development of Amethi, he said, ‚ÄúIt is unfortunate that the BJP has harmed the interest of people of Amethi‚Ä¶this is wrong. Their (BJP‚Äôs) thinking is like this only‚Ä¶but I will fight for you all.‚Äù

Referring to schemes such as Make in India and Start up campaigns, Rahul said these will have no meaning if there is no talk about ‚ÄòMake in Amethi‚Äô and ‚ÄòMake in UP‚Äô.

On the second day of his tour, Rahul will meet people at Munshiganj guest house here and later address party workers at Mohanganj and also address a conference of partymen.

On Friday, he will meet party workers at Bhuamau in Rae Bareli Lok Sabha constituency of his mother Sonia Gandhi before returning to Delhi.",https://rstv.nic.in/address-issue-employment-rahul-gandhi.html,
Regular employment is a cause for concern: Ram Madhav,"In an interview to Rajya Sabha TV, ideologue & BJP National General Secretary Ram Madhav slammed the opposition for politicising the farmers‚Äô unrest and the Kashmir issue. He said that the Opposition only looks for photo-opportunity moments.

On the job creation crisis, Madhav categorically said that regular employment was a cause for concern. He claimed that figures of self employment have not been taken into consideration, and once that‚Äôs done the employment figures would look better.

He completely dismissed reports about the press being gagged. The leader who has also been an RSS ideologue, said that media writes against against the Modi government and that the Indian journalists are not meek to succumb under any kind of governmental pressure.

Justifying the cattle sale ban, Madhav said the government has done what the apex court asked for to check cattle smuggling. Dismissing reports of a larger Hindutva agenda Madhav said BJP government was not imposing anything on anyone.

Here are some edited excerpts from the interview:

What have been the challenges for the past three years for Modi government?

Any government should be rated by its performance and popularity and how people perceive the governance. On that count I think the current government has done well.

What is BJP minus Narendra Modi?

This is a futile effort to separate Modi from BJP. Modi and BJP is one entity. It doesn‚Äôt work that way.

What sense do you get from the opposition in the country today?

As a politician of the ruling party I will be the happiest person if the opposition is not working. It‚Äôs not the ruling party‚Äôs responsibility to see how opposition functions. I feel that there should be a more coherent opposition voice. Opposition is directionless.

Job creation is a major area of concern, average employment generation has plummeted to 2 lakh jobs a year?

Job creation has been a challenge for the last ten years. The number of people becoming employable is high but job creation has been not that high. There are several self employment schemes and those figures have still not been accounted. Regular employment is definitely a cause for concern.

Farmers are rioting in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, is the policy towards the farmers going wrong somewhere?

Government has done so much for the welfare of the farmers from soil health cards, insurance schemes, making things available at low rates, availability of technology.

Is farmers‚Äô unrest a political or socio economic symptom of a disease?

Farmers want loan waivers. It‚Äôs a big challenge for any government, procurement is a very big problem, if procurement is not addressed, the farmers suffer. Political parties are finding photo opportunities in farmers‚Äô agitations. They are encouraging violence.

There is no big idea on Kashmir by the NDA government?

It‚Äôs problem for the entire country to understand. It should not be looked at from the prism of PDP-BJP. There is an effort to oust the PDP-BJP government. Many political parties are not comfortable with the idea of the current political set up. It‚Äôs easy to stoke violence.

Your approach towards Kashmir is almost like the Congress?

We have stood firm on issues like no compromise with the separatists. We have nothing to do with these groups.

For the present government, is Kashmir about Pakistan and terrorism?

People sitting in the TV studio do not know that it‚Äôs not a political issue. Separatist groups do not want any development to happen. We have extended a package of Rs. 80,0000 crore.

There is a feeling that BJP has forced the PDP to become moderate and they have lost their credibility?

What‚Äôs the harm if they are moderate? Everybody in politics should be moderate.

What was the idea behind the cattle sale ban?

Today for want of any issues people misrepresent ideas. During UPA regime a senior Congress leader was accused of cattle being smuggled in to neighbouring countries. They recommended that there should be a ban on cattle for slaughtering purposes. Supreme Court now has come up with a directive. They have come up with some guidelines. There is large scale dependence on cattle.

What about the economic fallout on the meat industry?

People can go back to the court if they feel injustice has been done to them. We have to realise that the economic cost of small farmers is more important than the economic fallout on meat industry. We need a balance between the two.

There is an effort to homogenise the society into Hindutva society on the basis of hatred for Muslims?

No one believes what the opposition says. Here is a government that cares for each and everyone. Our track record is the answer.

On foreign policy, has the government faltered with Pakistan and China?

We stood firm on our interests and our sovereignty. Our relations have also not deteriorated. We have to take a stand on issues like belt and road. Even China does not tolerate when sovereignty issues come in their way. Pakistan is a difficult neighbour. Even Manmohan faced problems. At the international arena we have isolated Pakistan.

Is there hyper nationalism?

If there is hyper nationalism there is also hyper anti-nationalism. Everybody is free to abuse, it‚Äôs a thin line.

India has slipped on freedom of press index. People are gagged if they speak against the government?

India‚Äôs journalists are so meek that they succumb under pressure, are you trying to say that? Everyone is attacking the government. Not just that, media is also isolating anyone who is speaking for the government.
