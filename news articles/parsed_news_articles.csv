0,"Comprehensive employment, industrial policies are necessary to address jobs crisis","since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image) since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image)

A report in this paper (IE, November 1) on various employment estimates for 2017-18, based on the PLFS (periodic labour force survey) data, has received considerable attention. We have received several queries from policy makers regarding the differences in our employment estimates with studies by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey (BD), and Himanshu that are quoted in the report. In this article, we clarify the reasons for the differences and highlight the major findings of our study.

First, our estimates are different from that of BD because theirs are based only on the usual principal status (UPS) of employment. Our study is based on both usual principal and subsidiary status (UPSS) of employment. Since Himanshu‚Äôs estimates are also based on UPSS, our figures are not much different except for the 2017-18 PLFS figures. Himanshu‚Äôs and our estimates for employment in both 2004-05 and 2011-12 are almost the same (the negligible difference is because of the use of population multipliers that differ at second and third decimal points). The discrepancy with Himanshu‚Äôs 2017-18 employment figure is only because he probably used a lower population multiplier based on a projected total population of 1.33 billion.

But, while comparing Himanshu‚Äôs estimates with that of BD for 2017-18, we find that both their figures are the same (this is surprising since BD have ignored the subsidiary status of employment unlike Himanshu). We have explored why this has happened. BD have used a projected population of close to 1.36 billion based on their argument that the annual population growth of India was about 1.7 per cent between 2011-12 and 2017-18. This is a very high overestimation of India‚Äôs population growth rate during this period. The World Bank‚Äôs population projection (available at World Development Indicators) shows that annual population growth in India was only 1.2 per cent per annum in 2012 and 1.04 per cent in 2018, and the total population was about 1.34 billion in 2017-18. Our population projections (based on a monthly exponential growth rate) show that the total population in India was about 1.345 billion in 2017-18 (the same as the World Bank‚Äôs estimate).

The National Family Health Survey 2015-16 shows that there has been a phenomenal decline in the total fertility rate (the number of children born to women in the reproductive age group of 15-49), reaching a near replacement rate of 2.2 per woman, from 2.7 in 2005-06. Hence, the 1.06 per cent population growth rate we use is logical; and 1.7 per cent cannot be India‚Äôs current population growth rate. The use of the latter artificially raises the workforce number that BD came up with, 457 million in 2017-18. This is surprising since they had missed out on subsidiary workers altogether. Hence, they fail to find that the total jobs in India fell by nine million in six years, a first in India‚Äôs history.

Moreover, since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. The principal employment status is recorded for a relatively longer duration of time in the survey year (normally for a period of six months and more). It leaves out those who work for less than six months, and who must also be counted among those working. The subsidiary status of employment data (covering those working 30 days but less than 182 days), covers those not employed in the principal status, and must be added to workers in principal status. So, by ignoring the subsidiary employment, BD provide an incomplete and incorrect employment trend for India.

Hence, BD‚Äôs claim that manufacturing employment during 2011-12 and 2017-18 was ‚Äústagnant‚Äù is also misleading. In fact, based on the UPSS, we found that manufacturing employment actually declined by three million between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. While labour intensive sub-sectors were mainly responsible for this decline, a few capital intensive manufacturing sub-sectors did register consistent growth of jobs during 2004-05 and 2017-2018. Although the quality of jobs is very poor in the services sector, it has played a major role in driving job growth, but only partly offsetting the fall in employment in agriculture, manufacturing, and slowing employment creation in the construction sector. In fact, because of their problematic methodology, BD fail to notice the actual fall in total employment (including self-employment of the Ola/Uber or Mudra variety, which is captured in a comprehensive sample of the unorganised and organised sector workers).

The share of regular and formal employment increased marginally due to growth of formal jobs in the private sector, but the share of informal jobs (without social security) within the government/public sector has increased. A dominant and rising share of jobs is still generated by micro and small units in the unorganised sectors without any formal or written job contract. In both government and private sectors, the number of contract jobs (with no written contract, or less than a year‚Äôs contract, or one to three-years contract) is on the rise post 2011-12. Although BD‚Äôs paper also reveals the same story, we differ from them on the absolute number of jobs. The rate of growth of jobs in the unorganised component is much higher than in the organised sector (those with more than 10 workers).

Moreover, BD‚Äôs research also provides a partial picture of the unemployment trends in India as they could not capture the upsurge in open unemployment among educated youth (which has more than doubled in a matter of six years), nor the recent rise in the disheartened youth labour force (those in the age group of 15-29 and not in educational institutions or the labour force). We found that the number of disheartened youth (having secondary and above level of general education, and with technical and vocational qualifications) is rising at an alarming rate.

With total jobs falling at a time when new entrants into the labour force are increasing at an accelerating pace, it is not surprising that real wages have not increased in both rural and urban areas. From now on, entrants into the labour force will increase at an accelerating pace, at least until 2030. Hence, a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy (to boost growth of medium and large firms) is necessary to address the transformation of agrarian workforce, boost real wages, and to ensure industrial development.

1,Explained: Is the push towards organised manufacturing the answer to India‚Äôs jobs crisis?,"For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector. For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

In any Budget, there are essentially two main questions that need to be answered. One, what is the outlook on boosting economic growth. Two, what is the status of the fiscal health of the government ‚Äî that is, what is the level of fiscal deficit etc.

This year, however, there is another big question: What can the government do to boost employment in the country.

In the past year, there have been several reports, both official and by independent academics, that have painted a bleak picture on the jobs front. For instance, a 2017-18 National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) survey pegged unemployment at a 45-year high. Other researchers like Mehrotra & Parida as well as Himanshu have shown how the absolute number of ‚Äúemployed‚Äù people witnessed a decline between 2012 and 2018.

For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

Why manufacturing?

It has been argued that between the three broad sectors of the economy ‚Äî agriculture, industry and services ‚Äî it is the industry sector, and within industry, the manufacturing sector that has the highest potential to absorb the surplus labour in the economy.

Agriculture, which engages almost half the Indian workforce, does not grow fast enough and is, as such, not remunerative enough to provide gainful employment to the millions who join India‚Äôs workforce each year. It is for this reason why more and more people have left agriculture and tried to join other sectors of the economy since 2004.

Services is a fast-growing sector and pays well but it places far greater demands on job seekers in terms of skills and education. Often, the rural millions looking for a job find themselves inadequate in terms of delivering in the services sector ‚Äî not without skills education at least.

That leaves the industry, which includes sub-sectors like manufacturing and non-manufacturing (that is, construction and mining etc.). Research shows that the employment elasticity ‚Äî the ability to create new jobs with every additional increase in a sector‚Äôs growth ‚Äî of the manufacturing sector is the highest.

Explaining the Budget, Part-1: How the Union Budget is prepared

What did the past governments do?

For a while now, both UPA and NDA governments have tried to focus on boosting the growth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, in 2011, Congress-led UPA came out with a new National Manufacturing Policy that aimed at raising the share of the manufacturing sector to 25% of the GDP by 2022. The BJP-led NDA too unveiled the Make in India initiative that focussed using manufacturing as the main platform to create jobs.

Each Union Budget tends to focus on measures that will promote manufacturing ‚Äî both big- and small-scale ‚Äî and create jobs.

However, despite such a focussed stand right through the past decade, manufacturing‚Äôs share is still under 17% of the GDP and the jobs situation in the country has only got worse.

What does the data show?

An analysis of the Indian manufacturing sector done by India Ratings shows that manufacturing units in the organised sector are becoming more capital intensive ‚Äî that is the capital-to-labour ratio is increasing. In other words, instead of increasing the number of workers in a unit, owners are choosing to increase the amount of capital.

As Table 1 shows, the trend is of a secular increase over the years. What is worse is that this trend holds true across the board including those sectors such as textiles and leather products that are considered ‚Äúlabour-intensive‚Äù and most capable of creating jobs and soaking up surplus labour (see Tables 2 and 3).

The oddest bit in this trend is that owners of these manufacturing units appear to be increasingly substituting labour with capital even when the return on capital is falling. Data shows that in the organised manufacturing sector profit per unit of capital invested has fallen sharply between 2007-08 and 2017-18.

The flip side of this picture is the decline in India‚Äôs labour productivity growth rate ‚Äî see Table 4

Not surprisingly, this trend of falling labour productivity growth in organised manufacturing has also gone along with a decline in wage growth ‚Äî Table 5

Yet again, this trend of decline in wage growth is largely secular across the board and includes sectors like textiles and leather that could create the maximum jobs.

Explaining the Budget, Part-2: What ails the credibility of India‚Äôs Budget numbers

What is the upshot?

The data shows that in organised manufacturing ‚Äî that is, manufacturing done in the formal sector where workers are covered under labour laws etc. ‚Äî labour productivity growth and wages growth are declining and businesses are increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital.

This raises several questions for policymakers:

1> Why are manufacturing owners increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital? It is important to note that they continue to do so even when the return on capital is falling.

2> If this is the trend, how reasonable is it to assume that boosting manufacturing growth will create more jobs for the Indian youth?

3> The government has been increasingly pushing for ‚Äúorganised‚Äù or formal sector manufacturing but if this trend is anything to go by, is such a push justified?

4> What is the extent to which the lack of significant labour reform is holding back manufacturing from achieving its potential to create jobs?

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stands up to present the Budget on February 1, these are some of the issues she could be expected to address when discussing the growing question mark on unemployment in India.

2,It‚Äôs a wage crisis,"At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.

The debate around unemployment is unhelpful ‚Äî since 1947, unemployment has bounced between 3-7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force. But reconciling this mathematical accuracy with our painful poverty ‚Äî it has bounced between 25-75 per cent of our population since 1947, based on your definition of needs, wants and desires ‚Äî needs an understanding of the ‚Äúself-exploitation‚Äù theory proposed by the Russian economist Alexander Chayanov in the 1920s. He convinced Jawaharlal Nehru that small farms are viable because you don‚Äôt have to pay yourself rent or pay a salary to yourself, spouse or kids. I make the case that one, self-exploitation ‚Äî hanging out vella (idle) with low or zero marginal productivity in farms, self-employment or subsistence wage employment ‚Äî has been India‚Äôs labour market shock absorber since 1947. Two, this shock absorber no longer works because Indians born after 1991 expect a living wage (that meets aspirations) rather than a minimum wage (that keeps mind and body together). And three, these higher wage expectations can only be met by transitioning people to higher productivity sectors, geographies, and firms.

Our current debate confuses jobs with wages. Almost every Indian who wants a job has a job but they don‚Äôt get the wages they want or need because they work in unviable sectors (48 per cent of our labour force on farms generates only 13 per cent of the GDP), unviable firms (our 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 19,500 companies with a paid-up capital greater than Rs 10 crore), unviable entrepreneurship (50 per cent of our labour force is not self-employed but self-exploiting), and unviable geographies (2 lakh of our 6 lakh villages have less than 200 people).

Historian Ramachandra Guha reminds us that India may not yet be the most important or powerful country in the world but it is surely the most interesting. Our political parties have created the world‚Äôs largest democracy on the infertile soil of the world‚Äôs most hierarchical society. But we had zero chances of creating the world‚Äôs largest economy on the infertile soil of the economic model articulated by the Avadi Resolution of 1955 and the Second Five Year plan of 1956. High wages need a complex ecosystem of high productivity firms and individuals: IT firms employ only 0.7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force but produce 7 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP. A waiter in Chicago with skills similar to a waiter in Jaipur makes 20 times higher wages because of the productivity of the customers eating at the restaurant, and India‚Äôs 20 million manufacturing SME‚Äôs have at least 25 times lower productivity than Germany‚Äôs 200,000 mittelstand (SMEs).

Essentially, the GDP of 114 million Maharashtrians is more than 204 million people in Uttar Pradesh because Maharashtra is more formalised, industrialised, financialised, urbanised and skilled. Similarly, the GDP of 1.2 billion Indians till 2019 was lower than 66 million Britons because socialism ‚Äî capitalism without competition and bankruptcy ‚Äî led to nutty economics after 1947. Three books ‚Äî Capitalism in America; A History by Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap by Yuen Yuen Ang, and Lost Glory; India‚Äôs Capitalism Story by Sumit Majumdar ‚Äî talk about choices and consequences. America amplified prosperity (35 per cent of people in official poverty have air-conditioning and 60 per cent have a car), China has used markets to move 700 million people out of poverty since 1978, while our licence-raj bred inefficiency. Politician Vasant Sathe pointed out in the 1980s that India‚Äôs public sector steel industry employed 10 times more people to produce half the steel of South Koreans.

But India is breaking with its past. We have six million new registered enterprises after GST and 30 million new social security payers in three years. Our new monetary policy committee and fiscal discipline have blunted inflation from 8.33 per cent in 2014 to 2.19 per cent. Our new bankruptcy law has started recycling assets of Rs 14 lakh crore. In the 1960s, the-then RBI governor L K Jha had presciently warned that resource utilisation is as important as resource mobilisation. Digital payments have exploded from 0.1 million the month before demonetisation to 650 million last month. Infrastructure spending has doubled in the last five years accompanied by qualitative improvements in air connectivity, ports, highways and railways. Finally, a modern state is a welfare state with a broad tax base; India has more than a crore new individual tax filers since demonetisation with a 45 per cent increase in returns with incomes below Rs 10 lakh last year.

For India‚Äôs 25th birthday in 1972, the late Sheila Dhar wrote a wonderful book, This India that suggested, ‚ÄúIndians have great patience. It is not in their nature to be in a hurry. They can wait longer, suffer more and work harder than other people.‚Äù This paragraph would probably change for the 75th birthday version in 2022; the impatience of our young is changing India and her politics. And thankfully, our democracy means that the Chinese communist party strategy articulated in the 1980s ‚Äî fill their stomachs but empty their minds ‚Äî will not work in India. India‚Äôs youth don‚Äôt aspire to replace self-exploitation with the patronising pessimism of loan-write offs, subsidies or income without work; they recognise that a hard day‚Äôs work in a formal job provides dignity, strength, identity and purpose in addition to living wages.

At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. In 1910, Tagore articulated this vision in ‚ÄòChitto Jetha Bhoyshunno‚Äô hoping his country would awake to a freedom where tireless striving stretches its arms to perfection. The end of our acceptance of self-exploitation embodies a freedom that would please the great sentinel. India‚Äôs challenge is not jobs but employed poverty and while there is much unfinished work, it‚Äôs delusional to believe we aren‚Äôt making good progress. And it is unhelpful presentism to believe that policy-makers have no choice other than viewing our youth as petitioners rather than potential apprentices.

3,The rising insecurity,"Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector.

There are several pointers to the jobs crisis in India: One, the number of workers in the age-group of 18-30 employed under the MGNREGA rose to 7.07 million in 2018-19, up from 5.8 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî signaling the lack of employment opportunities. Two, a study commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister says that even in the organised sector in India there was a preference in favour of ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs between 2011-12 and 2017-18. Thus, not only are enough employment opportunities not being created for the millions entering the labour market and for those shifting out of agriculture, but even the jobs that are being added are of the ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù kind, calling into question the quality of jobs created.

Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. But with the sector in the midst of a multi-year slowdown, employment opportunities are likely to have severely diminished. It is thus possible that the slowdown in economic activity, especially in the non-farm labour intensive sectors in both rural and urban areas, coupled with the terms of trade shifting against agriculture, would have pushed workers to seek employment under the employment guarantee scheme. The NSSO PLFS report also shows that youth unemployment (age group of 15 to 29) surged from 6.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 17.8 per cent in 2017-18, indicating that not enough employment opportunities exist. This slack in the labour market also reflects in the subdued wage growth. On the other hand, the jobs report indicates a shift towards informalisation of work relations even in the organised sector during this period. And as these ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs are unlikely to provide any form of social security benefits, it raises questions over the quality of these jobs.

The Mudra programme was meant to help tackle the jobs crisis in India. As reported in this paper, Rs 5.71 lakh crore was sanctioned during the first three years of this programme through 12.27 crore loan accounts. Yet, only 1.12 crore additional jobs were created during this period, implying that every new loan did not create an additional employment opportunity. This inability to create enough quality jobs will have long-term repercussions for the Indian economy. India is in the midst of a demographic transition, but the data so far suggests that it has not been able to take advantage of it.

4,"With India facing a job crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms","Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File) Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File)

Since he began his second term as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has talked of many things. Nationalism, Kashmir, citizenship, Pakistan, patriotism, treacherous Congress leaders. The one thing he seems to avoid talking about is the economy. Is this because he knows that the economy is in worse shape now than when he first became Prime Minister? Is this because as an astute politician he has noticed that much of the unrest we have seen on campuses across India is because India‚Äôs young people are beginning to feel a sense of hopelessness? A terrifying realisation that no matter how hard they work at their studies they could remain jobless for years?

Wherever I go these days I meet educated young Indians, many of whom voted for Modi, who admit that the thought of the future frightens them. They wear jeans, carry mobile phones and cut their hair in the latest fashion and almost the first thing they say to me is that they would be grateful if I could help them find a job. Not a government job. Just one that does not involve menial work. Even a street child I have helped with her education wants to be a fashion designer.

If for no other reason than that India faces an unemployment crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms last week. He tried his best to assure Modi and his ministers that he came bearing the gift of creating a million new jobs by 2025. Wearing an Indian waistcoat and radiating hope and goodwill, the world‚Äôs richest man declared that he was sure that the 21st century would be India‚Äôs century. But, instead of being welcomed, he was insulted publicly by Modi‚Äôs Minister of Commerce who told him that he did India no ‚Äúfavours‚Äù by offering to invest a billion dollars. ‚ÄúThey (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars, but then, if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,‚Äù said Piyush Goyal. If this was not rude enough, there was more to come. A senior BJP official intervened to tweet that Bezos order his newspaper, The Washington Post, to start writing nice things about the Modi government if he wanted to do business here.

The Prime Minister himself is so sensitive about the sullying of his image abroad by ‚Äòliberal‚Äô newspapers that he found no time to grant Bezos an audience. An odd decision if you consider that he travels to distant lands regularly to urge investors to come ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. Amazon is already, in its fashion, making in India. In rural India, Amazon has become almost a synonym for online shopping. Many of the unemployed youths I run into on my travels regularly go to it to buy everything from small household goods to books. Since in my own case I restrict my online shopping to books, I am constantly startled by the range of goods that young Indians are buying on Amazon. Insulting Bezos was in my view a mistake on the part of the Modi government.

Another mistake that the Prime Minister needs to pay much more attention to is his neglect of the economy in pursuit of political goals like abrogating Article 370 and passing that amendment to the citizenship law that has caused so much misgiving and mistrust. Both the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, have repeatedly urged Indian businessmen to invest without fear, but if this has not begun to happen, it is on account of misgiving and mistrust. The mission to ‚Äòeradicate‚Äô black money that began with demonetisation has given so much power to petty officials that they have all started to behave with the same obnoxious officiousness they displayed in bad old socialist times when the Licence Raj was alive and dominant. I live in Mumbai and can report that in recent months I have not met a single businessman, big or small, who has said that business was good.

What should worry the Prime Minister more is that most people blame him for what has gone wrong, whether it is businessmen, shopkeepers or jobless youth. In one voice they say that they voted for Modi not once but twice in the hope that he would concentrate on reviving the economy. When I ask if they are not pleased that such big political reforms as the abrogation of Article 370 have happened, they admit that they are not displeased. But that what they want more is for the economy to start showing signs of real recovery. It is in Modi‚Äôs hands to control the uncertainty that is caused by the endless new rules and regulations that his officials have come up with. But it is in the hands of men like Bezos to create the millions of jobs that young Indians desperately need.

5,The problem of skilling India,"The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar) The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent Independence Day speech, said, ‚ÄúWe need to worry about population explosion‚Äù. These words stand in stark contrast to his previous references to India‚Äôs demographic dividend where the country‚Äôs population was seen as an asset. This shift reflects a new awareness, according to which demography brings a dividend only if the youth is trained properly. Without proper training, instead of benefits, the country gets massive joblessness ‚Äî at least, this is what common sense suggests. Reality is more complicated.

A minimum of eight million new job seekers enter the jobs market every year. In 2017, only 5.5 million had been created, and the situation is worsening: Unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years today. The Indian youth has become the first casualty, with the unemployment rate reaching 34 per cent among the 20-24-year-olds in the first quarter of 2019 ‚Äî it was 37.9 per cent among the urban lot, according to the CMIE. Official sources from the government of India do not give very different data: According to the last 2018 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate among the urban 15-29-year-olds (a very large bracket) was 23.7 per cent. One may hypothesise that this pervasive joblessness was due to the poor training of the youth as only seven per cent of the people surveyed in the framework of the PLFS declared any formal or informal training.

But there is a paradox here: According to a recent survey, 48 per cent of Indian employers reported difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortage. The worst affected sector ‚Äî which is also one of the strong points of India‚Äôs economy ‚Äî has been Information Technology (IT), where 1,40,000 skilled techies could not be recruited in 2018 despite the employers‚Äô efforts (a high proportion of the 5,00,000 job offers that had been made that year). Indeed, the CMIE reports show that the more educated Indians are, the more likely they are to remain unemployed too. The last PLFS for 2018 revealed that 33 per cent of the formally trained 15-29-year-olds were jobless.

The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough. Hence, the ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù programme, whose objective was ‚Äúto train a minimum of 300 million skilled people by the year 2022‚Äù. In 2014, Modi created a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to harmonise training processes, assessments, certification and outcomes and, crucially, to develop Industrial Training Institutions (ITIs) ‚Äî the building blocks of this endeavour. The Executive Committee monitoring the mission gathered representatives of nine ministries, as vocational training was seen at the intersection of different domains, including agriculture, information technology, human resources development.

Modi, who chaired the governing council and announced the setting up of 1,500 new ITIs and 50,000 Skill Development Centres, committed himself to ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù in eloquent terms: ‚ÄúToday, the world and India need a skilled workforce. I also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this‚Äù.

Clearly, Modi saw ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù as a plan complementary to another flagship scheme he launched in 2014 ‚Äî ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù, a policy inviting foreign investors, and, as a way to train entrepreneurs (as evident from the name of the ministry in charge of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù).

Besides the creation of more courses and institutes of vocational training, the main innovation of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù consisted in integrating ‚Äúvocational training classes linked to the local economy‚Äù with formal education from class nine onwards in at least 25 per cent of the schools and higher education bodies. A very important aspect of Skill India was its PPP character: Companies were requested to ‚Äúearmark 2 per cent of their payroll bill (including for contract labour) for skill development initiatives‚Äù. In parallel, the ITIs were supposed to ‚Äútie up with industry in the relevant trades to improve placement opportunities for candidates‚Äù.

One of the most innovative dimensions of Skill India was the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana under which the training fees was paid by the government. The PMKVY‚Äôs budget was approximately Rs 12,000 crore for four years (2016-2020). Its main tool was the ‚Äúshort-term training‚Äù, which could last between 150 and 300 hours, and which included some placement assistance by Training Partners upon successful completion of their assessment by the candidates.

While the intentions of Skill India are commendable, the scheme falls short of the initial objectives. The target of this scheme was to reach out to 300 million young people by 2022, but only a mere 25 million had been trained under this scheme by the end of 2018. Partly due to mismanagement and partly due to the fact that funds available for ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù were either not spent sufficiently quickly ‚Äî because of a lack of candidates ‚Äî or too little was spent. The money problem is evident from the graph and from the PLF Survey mentioned above which showed that, in 2018, only 16 per cent of the youth who had received ‚Äúformal training were funded by the government‚Äù.

But the real problem lies elsewhere: Those who have been trained don‚Äôt find jobs. The number of those who have benefited from the Skill India scheme has increased, from 3,50,000 in 2016-17 to 1.6 million in 2017-18, but the percentage of those who could find a job upon completion of their training has dropped from more than 50 per cent to 30 per cent. If one focuses only on the PMKVY, the results are even more disappointing. Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha in March 2018, the then minister for skill development, Dharmendra Pradhan, told the House that in the framework of this programme 4.13 million people had been trained, but only 6,15,000 (15 per cent) of them got a job.

These limitations may be explained from three points of view.

First, the training was not good enough ‚Äì and this is why the employability rate remains very low. Second, while the government expected that some of the PMKVY-trainees would create their own enterprise, only 24 per cent of the 6,15,000 mentioned above started their business. And out of them, only 10,000 applied for MUDRA loans ‚Äîa drop in the ocean. Third, and more importantly, India‚Äôs joblessness issue is not only a skills problem, it is representative of the lack of appetite of industrialists and SMEs for recruiting. The decline of the investment rate is a clear indication that the demand is weak ‚Äîhence huge idle capacities ‚Äî and investing is not an easy thing to do anyway because of the limited access to credit that the accumulation of Non-Performing Assets has generated.

Skill India will not be enough to create jobs if the slowdown continues. But in the long run, Skill India will also not be enough if government expenditures in education remain low and if, therefore, the ground isn‚Äôt prepared for proper training. In fact, under the Modi government, allocation for school education has declined from 2.81 per cent of the budget in 2013-14 to 2.05 per cent in 2018-19. It was above 3 per cent during UPA II.

6,A problem of measurement,"We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar) We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar)

Modi 2.0 presents a new window of opportunity to usher in some fundamental reforms for the Indian economy. A modern dynamic economy requires a robust statistical system to provide precise and real time estimates of several critical indicators. One of these is unemployment ‚Äî which has been at the heart of prolonged acrimonious public debate in India for several years. Now is the time to move beyond the politics of unemployment to the real and pressing issue of measurement of unemployment. In 2016-17, the government of India, quite rightly so, was of the view that the existing frequency of measuring key unemployment and employment indicators was not adequate for the design of economic policies. There was a need for more timely and periodic measures ‚Äî a quarterly estimate in urban areas and an annual estimate in rural areas ‚Äî the ‚ÄúPeriodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)‚Äù. A committee of senior bureaucrats, economists and business leaders was constituted to look into this and an all-India PLFS survey was undertaken.

The results of this survey have not been officially released. However, the leaked reports of an historically high unemployment rate and the subsequent resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), who were involved with the PLFS, created a furore and heightened the politicisation of unemployment. The Opposition used this as an opportunity to malign the government, while the government representatives at NITI Aayog resorted to the view that the survey results have not been reviewed by experts, and therefore the report was not deemed reliable enough to be released. The truth of the matter, however, is that there is neither credible evidence of a job crisis in India, nor credible evidence of the absence of it. The problem requires a serious effort by the government to address issues of measurement. In this essay, I will outline what the government needs to do in this regard.

First, measurement of economic indicators, for example the unemployment rate, is an apolitical issue that requires statistical expertise of the highest standards. Before the release of any figure, it is imperative to discuss, debate and deliberate the methodological issues around the measurement. For example, to measure the unemployment rate, it is practically impossible to conduct a periodic census of all citizens above 15 years. Therefore, we have to rely on the second-best option of conducting sample surveys, and the natural question is then about the size of the sample survey. The sample size critically depends on the question of interest, for example, the sample size in the US is determined ‚Äúon the requirement that a difference of 0.2 percentage points in the unemployment rate for two consecutive months be statistically significant at the 0.10 level‚Äù. If the objective of the PLFS was to measure changes in unemployment from quarter-to-quarter in urban areas and year-to-year in rural areas, then we need to discuss sampling precisely to gauge these estimates. Therefore, there can be no credible discussion on changes in unemployment from one period to another in the absence of a paper that outlines in detail the underlying sampling methodology. Proprietary databases like the CMIE, which claim to estimate these time trends, have marketed themselves with a complete absence of such methodological requirements, and are hence non-credible.

Second, even if the sample size issue is addressed to minimise what statisticians call sampling errors (the sample size might not be large enough to address the question of interest), there are issues relating to non-sampling errors. This includes non-participation in the survey or refusal to answer some questions or misunderstanding of survey questions. Each of these are important issues and needs to be addressed in the methodology. For example, suppose there is a job boom in the economy and the employed overwhelmingly refuse to participate in such surveys or do not answer all questions, then it is possible for the survey to indicate high unemployment. Therefore, non-participation is an important issue and methodological rigour requires for a survey to have transparent strategies to prevent or minimise these errors.

Third, India is a large, complex and diverse economy that is undergoing structural transformation. Hence, we are moving towards precision policy-making which requires local and real time socio-economic indicators. We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. This requires local measures of unemployment so that economic policies can be tailored depending on local conditions. For instance, unemployment is a rural phenomenon in several states, while in others it is concentrated in urban areas. The state governments will have to participate along with the central government to have comparable uniform measures of periodic unemployment. This requires state governments to conduct periodic surveys on the same lines as the central government. Unfortunately, at present, several state governments do not have the capacity to conduct such regular surveys. This, however, is imperative for a large dynamic economy such as ours. Robust statistical systems will require that we begin to create such local capabilities urgently. It is time to move beyond one-size-fits-all solutions to more inclusive solutions that take into account local conditions.

In the end, one cannot help but recall eminent statistician John W Tukey‚Äôs words in 1949: ‚ÄúIt is far easier to put out a figure than to accompany it with a wise and reasoned account of its liability to systematic and fluctuating errors. Yet if the figure is to serve as the basis of an important decision, the accompanying account may be more important than the figure itself.‚Äù

To enhance India‚Äôs statistical capabilities, we have to move beyond the politics of it and focus on measuring with precision. Timely estimates are the cornerstones of policy-making in a modern dynamic and an aspirational economy like ours.

7,"Six-year low ‚Äî and slow: GDP growth recorded at 4.5 per cent, lowest in more than 6 years","Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed. Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Dragged down by a contraction in manufacturing, weak investment, and lower consumption demand, India‚Äôs GDP growth rate at 4.5 per cent for Q2, 2019-20, hit a 26-quarter low in July-September, data released by National Statistical Office Friday showed.

This is the lowest quarterly growth rate in the five-and-half years of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The previous low was 4.3 per cent during January-March 2012-13.

READ | GDP growth at 4.5 per cent: Manmohan flags fear, India Inc‚Äôs silence on slowdown is telling

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), scheduled to announce its bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 5, is expected to continue its accommodative monetary policy stance with another repo rate cut to support growth.

Growth rate in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA), which is GDP minus net product taxes and reflects supply-side growth, has slowed to 4.3 per cent in July-September as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. With this, GDP growth rate for April-September, the first half of this fiscal, is now at 4.8 per cent as against 7.5 per cent growth in the year-ago period.

The growth rate has now slowed for the sixth consecutive quarter, declining by 3.6 percentage points during this period.

The nominal GDP growth rate, which accounts for inflation, slowed further from the first quarter to 6.1 per cent in July-September from double-digit level of 12 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Manufacturing growth contracted 1 per cent as against 6.9 per cent growth last year during the same quarter, while the ‚Äúagriculture, forestry and fishing‚Äù sector recorded a growth rate of 2.1 per cent as against 4.9 per cent last year. GVA growth for the construction sector also slowed to 3.3 per cent in July-September from 8.5 per cent year ago.

Most economists had expected GDP growth rate for the second quarter to slip to sub-5 per cent level with projections hovering in the 4.2-4.7 per cent range.

At 4.5 per cent, the GDP growth is much lower than 5.3 per cent projected for July-September by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its October policy. For the country to clock a growth rate of even 5 per cent for the full 2019-20 financial year, the economy would now have to grow at least 5.2 per cent in the remaining two quarters of this financial year.

Economists said without the support of higher government expenditure, GDP growth would have been even much lower, with most high frequency data such as non-food credit growth, auto sales and select fast-moving consumer goods already been indicating this slowdown.

‚ÄúAs it is becoming apparent that even festive demand has not been able to lift consumer sentiment and consumption demand, we believe 2HFY20 growth is also likely to be lacklustre resulting in an overall GDP growth of 5.6 per cent 2019-20. The low nominal growth rate of 6.1 per cent in the second quarter also does not augur well both for the government and the corporate sector as tax collection of the government and top line of corporate sector is linked to nominal GDP. However, given the current-growth inflation dynamics, we believe RBI will go for another 25bp rate cut in the forthcoming monetary policy review in December 2019,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings & Research.

With declining household savings and lower buoyancy in government‚Äôs revenue collections, there will be limited fiscal space to spur economic growth. The slowdown is also expected to adversely affect income growth which, in turn, would further dent consumption demand. A favourable low base effect, however, would be seen third quarter onwards, which may help push the headline growth number higher.

All eyes are now on the use of the monetary policy tool through more rate cuts, with most economists expecting RBI to cut repo rate by 25 basis points in the upcoming December policy meet. Experts also said sector-wise demand stimulus, especially focused on the non-banking financial sector, will be the need of the hour.

‚ÄúJust to depend on another rate cut by RBI in the upcoming MPC meeting may not be sufficient. The situation demands a coordinated fiscal priming in areas with higher multipliers and where spends could be immediately combined with a monetary policy push to address the effective transmission of rate cuts to NBFCs. The effect of rural demand uptick on Q3 numbers will be crucial to avert a sub-5 per cent annual growth rate,‚Äù said Ranen Banerjee, Leader Public Finance and Economics, PwC India.

8,Urban jobless rate hits 4-quarter low at 9.3 per cent,"A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March. A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Unemployment rate in urban areas moderated to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters, the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the January-March quarter showed. The urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, stood at 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.8 per cent in April-June 2018.

Female unemployment rate, however, was higher than the overall rate at 11.6 per cent in January-March, lower than 12.3 per cent in October -December 2018 and 12.8 per cent in April-June 2018, while unemployment rate for males stood at 8.7 per cent in January-March, as against 9.2 per cent in the previous quarter and 9 per cent in April-June 2018.

A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Among males of all ages, the highest unemployment rate was seen in Odisha at 15.6 per cent, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 13 per cent and Delhi at 12.9 per cent.

Labour-force estimate, according to current weekly status (CWS), is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of seven days preceding the date of survey.

Explained Some relief, annual PLFS report awaited Urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, has slowed to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters. Female unemployment rate improved, though it continued to stay above the overall unemployment rate, at 11.6 per cent in January-March from 12.3 per cent in the previous quarter. At a time when there is overall slowdown in the economy, these figures show marginal improvement. However, going ahead, the key dataset to watch out would be the yet-to-be released annual PLFS report, which would provide unemployment rate for rural and urban areas for 2018-19.

Comparable figures for the January-March quarter of 2018 are not available as the first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ended December 2018 was brought out in May this year. To be sure, this data set differs from the Annual Report of Periodic Labour Force Survey, which covers both rural and urban areas and gives estimates of employment and unemployment in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS.

The first annual PLFS report, which was first withheld and then released in May this year, was for July 2017- June 2018. The second annual PLFS report for July 2018-June 2019 is yet to be released.

As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above inched lower to 46.5 per cent in January-March from 46.8 per cent in the previous quarter.

Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also recorded a decline to 19.1 per cent in January-March from 19.5 per cent in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4 per cent in January-March from 73.6 per cent in October-December.

Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in January-March was recorded at 37.7 per cent, lower than 38.2 per cent for the previous quarter. Female LFPR for 15-29 years age group was at 16 per cent in January-March as against 16.7 per cent in the previous quarter, while for males, the LFPR moderated to 57.9 per cent in January-March from 58.3 per cent.

A state-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively.

The worker population ratio, which gives an estimate of the workforce in the current weekly status, remained broadly at the same level as the previous quarter at 32.7 per cent in January-March, the data showed.

9,Youth unemployment rising with educational qualifications: Study,"‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image) ‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image)

A key takeaway from the study of India‚Äôs unemployment trends by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati Parida (of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Central University of Punjab, respectively) is the fast-rising trend of youth unemployment.

By youth, the study refers to people in the age group of 15 to 29 years of age. The total number of unemployed youth went up marginally from 8.9 million in 2004-05 to 9 million in 2011-12 but, has since shot up to 25.1 million in 2017-18.

READ | Employment falls first time ‚Äî by 9 million in 6 years: Study

What is worse is that the rate of unemployment (in per cent) is higher as one goes up educational attainment (see chart). Moreover, the authors have concluded that youth unemployment has risen for all categories of educational attainment. The states that housed most of these 25 million unemployed youth include Uttar Pradesh (3 mn), Andhra Pradesh (2.2 mn), Tamil Nadu (2.2 mn), Maharashtra (1.9 mn), Bihar (1.9 mn), West Bengal (1.5 mn), Madhya Pradesh (1.3 mn), Karnataka (1.2 mn), Rajasthan (1.2 mn), Odisha (1.1 mn), Gujarat (1 mn) and Kerala (1 mn).

Mehrotra & Parida have based their conclusions on the National Sample Survey Organisation‚Äôs Employment-Unemployment Surveys for 2004-05 and 2011-12, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2017-18.

According to Mehrotra, while the total jobs in the agricultural sector have continued to decline massively from 232 million in 2011-12 to 205 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî and this is a desirable trend ‚Äî the rate of new job creation in the other sectors of the economy has not been enough to absorb the excess labour. As such, while jobs have gone up in the services sector (from 127 million to 144 million in 2017-18) and the non-manufacturing sector ‚Äî which includes activities such as construction, mining etc. ‚Äî from 55 million to 59 million, yet manufacturing, a sector which has the most capacity to soak up excess labour, saw total employment fall ‚Äî far from growing ‚Äî from 60 million to 56 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. A reflection of this is that the number of youth (between ages 15 and 29) declaring themselves as ‚ÄúNot in Labour Force, Education, or Training‚Äù rose to over 100 million in 2017-18 from 83 million in 2011-12. ‚ÄúThese are young people who are disheartened by the state of affairs and are neither looking for jobs, nor are they interested in studying or training themselves,‚Äù says Mehrotra.

11,"Youth felt lack of jobs, so new panel to focus on it: Gujarat Chief Secretary","He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime.

A day after the Union government set up a Cabinet committee on employment and skill development, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the panel as during the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections youth were feeling about lack of employment and of not being engaged in the processes of national growth and national development.

Speaking at the inauguration of the first two-day annual Student Start-up Innovation Policy (SSIP) conference in Gandhinagar, Singh said, ‚ÄúDuring the entire (Lok Sabha) election process, youth was feeling that there is a lack of employment, lack of overall opportunities to get engaged in the national growth and national development. These are the few things that this Cabinet sub-committee (on employment and skill development) will look into.‚Äù

Pitching for start-ups as new job creators, Singh talked about a ‚Äúbleak‚Äù job scenario a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù to what big industries can offer jobs as. ‚ÄúIf you look at the overall perspective of what is likely to happen, whether the youth are getting employed as many times, we do feel that there is a bleak picture. The type of people are coming up, we feel very proud of a solid democratic dividend which a country very rarely has. India is passing through that democratic dividend phase, but are we actually going to harness that democratic dividend? Are we really in a position to take care and get the fullest advantage of the youth that we are having,‚Äù the chief secretary asked.

He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. But there‚Äôs a limit to the job creation and that is where the start-ups come in, he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd as PM (Modi) keeps telling that the youth do not have to be job seekers but job givers. This is the what the youth of India and what the expectation from all of you is.‚Äù

Praising the entrepreneurship skills of Gujaratis, Singh said that the Gujarat government has been at the ‚Äúforefront of pioneering policies and institutions which have gone a long way in making an innovation culture at the grassroots level. ‚ÄúIn sync with various Central government schemes like Make In India, Start-Up India, Atal Innovation Mission, National Innovation Council, the Gujarat government has also taken very concrete steps to nurture, to support, to promote creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship,‚Äù he said.

The conference was organised the Education Department of the Government of Gujarat and was attended by Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, Principal Secretary (Education), Govt of Gujarat Anju Sharma and Commissioner of Technical Education Avantika Singh Aulakh.

12,Sena: Nehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of jobs,"This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre. This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

The Shiv Sena on Monday criticised ally BJP over rising unemployment, saying that the ‚ÄúNehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of 10 crore jobs that the BJP promised in 2014‚Äù.

This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

In the editorial, the Sena said it seemed that the new government had started working but many challenges lay ahead. ‚ÄúWhile there was a rise in the satta bazaars and share market after hearing that the Narendra Modi government was coming to power, the GDP growth rate decreased and the rate of unemployment increased. It is not a good sign. Rather than only discussing and advertising on how to tackle it, action is required,‚Äù said the editorial.

The editorial referred to the National Sample Survey Office report that showed a rise in unemployment of 6.1 per cent.

‚ÄúThe Union labour ministry has confirmed it. These are not our figures. The ruling party is claiming that the rise in unemployment is not our sin. Nitin Gadkari said the BJP has not created the unemployment issue in the last five years. We agree with his view but it has not achieved the target of generating two crore jobs per year and ten crore jobs in the last five years. The Nehru-Gandhi family cannot be blamed for it,‚Äù said the editorial.

13,"Gujarat: 80% youth jobless, BJP govt failed on job issue claims Congress","Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs

The Congress, which has been demanding resignation of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani since the cancellation of the police recruitment exam last Sunday following paper leak, on Saturday upped its attack, saying that as the head of the government he has failed to rein in growing unemployment in Gujarat.

Quoting figures released by the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Federation of Industries Association, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that 80 per cent youth are unemployed in the state.

‚ÄúYouth look up to the government jobs because industries have become sick and are unable to provide employment to qualified youths. For 9,000 government jobs, a whopping 9.12 lakh people applied,‚Äù Modhwadia said, referring to the number of candidates who had applied for the police recruitment exam that was cancelled last Sunday.

Arjun Modhwadia Arjun Modhwadia

The party also accused the BJP government of crony capitalism, saying ‚Äúrelatives of big industrialists were being facilitated under the disguise of helping the MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), but the government is turning away genuinely needy entrepreneurs‚Äù.

Modhwadia also said that ‚Äúthanks to anti-industry policies of the BJP government, half of industries are shut and others are on the verge of closure‚Äù. ‚ÄúOut of 202 GIDC estates, only 102 are working, only two industrial estate were set up in the past 15 years of the BJP rule in Gujarat. Not only this, there has been a 10 per cent decline in finance to industries in the past seven months,‚Äù the former Congress Legislature Party leader said.

He said that in Surat textile units, 8.80 lakh people have been rendered jobless due to 40 production loss in looms. He also demanded charging of interest on idle industrial plots.

14,Economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government after operation J&K,"The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand) The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand)

The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the symbol of the seat of power of the government. Within a one-kilometre radius are Parliament, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, and North Block and South Block that house the key ministries of Home, Finance, Defence and External Affairs. The Prime Minister‚Äôs official residence is also within the radius of one kilometre as are the homes of the Vice-President, the Speaker, the three Defence Chiefs and most members of Parliament.

Multiple Conversations

What is the conversation in this power circle? It is about the dismembering of Jammu & Kashmir, the passage of controversial Bills in both Houses of Parliament, the capitulation of regional ruling parties, the dominance of Mr Narendra Modi, the laboured resolution of the issue of the leadership of the Congress party, and the sad passing of Sushma Swaraj. It is about everything except the economy.

Beginning barely 50 kilometres away in all directions from the centre, in practically every village and every poor urban neighbourhood, the conversation is radically different: it is mainly about the economy ‚Äî the decline or stagnation in real wages and real incomes, the lay-offs and retrenchments, the search in vain for jobs, the death and devastation caused by flood or drought, the crippling shortage of water and electricity, and the fight for survival in an unequal and harsh world.

About 1,150 kilometres away in Mumbai, the city that is home to the RBI, SEBI, the stock exchanges and corporate headquarters of many listed companies and banks, the conversation is about only one thing ‚Äî money, or the lack of it. It is about the steep decline in the BSE and NSE indices, the depreciation of the rupee, the rising yield on bonds, the mounting losses in public sector banks, the stiff taxes (and the heavy-handed enforcement), the pull-out by FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) and the suicide by V G Siddhartha, promoter of Cafe Coffee Day.

An Uncaring Government

In my view, a caring government will pay the highest attention to the conversation among the working people and the poor. The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. Unfortunately, the economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government which is barely able to conceal the triumphalism after Operation J&K.

Here is a snapshot of the economy:

1. GDP growth rate continues to decline. After 6.8% for the whole year and 5.8% in the last quarter of 2018-19, the first quarter of 2019-20 doesn‚Äôt seem too promising. RBI and others have lowered the forecast for the whole year 2019-20 to 6.9%; hence we will be lucky if the first quarter produces another 5.8%.

2. Core sector growth has dropped to a 50-month low of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation in all manufacturing segments is, on average, below 70%.

3. The rupee is now Asia‚Äôs worst-performing currency. It has fallen 3.4% against the US dollar in August.

4. Investment in new projects (private and government) announced in the quarter ending June 2019 declined to a 15-year low of Rs 71,337 crore. The value of projects completed in the quarter fell to a five-year low of Rs 69,494 crore. Revenue earning in rail freight (that comes from carrying coal, cement, petroleum, fertiliser, iron ore, etc) grew by 2.7% in April-June 2019, down from 6.4% in the same period last year.

5. In April-July 2019, exports (merchandise and services) grew by 3.13% over the same period last year while imports declined 0.45%, pointing to depressed economic activity.

6. Consumption is down as never before. In Q1 of 2019-20, car sales were down 23.3%, two-wheeler sales were down 11.7%, commercial vehicle sales were down 9.5% and tractor sales were down 14.1%. July was worse. Industry associations (SIAM and FADA) have reported that 2,30,000 jobs have been lost and 286 dealerships have been shut. In the construction industry, 12,80,000 units remained unsold at the end of March 2019.

7. Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) was no better. Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, among others, have reported volume growth rate in April-June 2019 that is one half or less than the volume growth rate in the same period last year.

8. WPI in July stood at 1.08%. Within the index, the manufacturing sector inflation stood at 0.34%. These are not good signs, they are signs of low demand.

9. Gross tax revenue of the Central government grew by 1.4% in Q1 of 2019-20 as against 22.1% in the same period last year. What this tells us is that incomes are lower for corporates and individuals and spending is less.

Where is the Plan?

We go back to the mantra of four drivers of growth: government expenditure, private investment, private consumption and exports. Evidently, none of the engines is revving up and driving growth. This has been said so many times and by so many people (including acknowledged economists), but the government is unwilling to hear or understand or act. The economy is one area where muscular nationalism will not work. On the contrary, it may work to the detriment of the economy.

15,"National male workforce shrinking, says labour report that Govt buried","The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image) The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image)

For the first time since 1993-94, the actual size of India‚Äôs male workforce, or men who are working, has shrunk. Data from the NSSO‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey 2017-18, reviewed by The Indian Express, account for 28.6 crore employed male in the country. This is the first instance of a drop in the male workforce that steadily swelled from 21.9 crore in 1993-94 to 30.4 crore in 2011-12 when the last NSSO survey was conducted. This suggests fewer men were employed in 2017-18 compared with five years ago.

The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (see chart). The slide is steeper ‚Äî 6.4% ‚Äî in the rural areas compared to a 4.7% setback observed in the urban sector. The yet -to-be-released PLFS report put the unemployment rate for male in urban and rural segments at 7.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively.

Experts, who did not wish to be named, said the data requires deeper study, but clearly points to job losses, and fewer fresh employment opportunities.

The NSSO report, based on the PLFS conducted between July 2017 and June 2018, is yet to be released by the government. The Acting Chairperson of the National Statistical Commission P C Mohanan and another member, J V Meenakshi, quit January-end this year after the government withheld the release of the report that was approved by the commission in December 2018.

The NSSO data shows an employment loss of 4.3 crore (from 30.9 crore in 2011-12 to 26.6 crore in 2017-18) in the rural and 0.4 crore (from 11.1 crore in 2011-12 to 10.7 crore in 2017-18) in the urban segment. While the employment loss in the rural segment hurt the women most (68 per cent), men suffered more (96 per cent) job losses in the urban areas. In all, since 2011-12, India‚Äôs national workforce shrunk by 4.7 crore ‚Äî more than the population of Saudi Arabia.

Economists call for raising voice against suppression of data

Read | Even Mudra job survey data put in deep freeze

While the NSSO publishes employment rates in percentage ‚Äî and not actual workforce figures ‚Äî its data sets include details of populations, sex ratio, labour force participation rates, employment-to-population ratio etc. Overall, the PLFS 2017-18 reported a 6.1 per cent unemployment rate, a sharp jump from 2.2 per cent reported in 2011-12.

Explained Why this should be a worry A shrinking workforce suggests an increase in the number of unemployed, and also points to fewer new job opportunities. Given India‚Äôs demography and labour force growth over the decades, this should be a cause for concern.

Like the 2017-18 NSSO survey, the 2011-12 survey also recorded a major loss of employment in rural women which was largely offset by a reasonable jump in employment in rural male. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, women in rural employment shrunk by 22 million. In the same period, male in rural employment increased by 13 million. This resulted in a net rural employment loss of 90 lakh in that period (see Table 2). But the growth reversal in male employment since 2011-12 resulted in over four and half times that loss in national employment.

According to PLFS 2017-18, the percentage of working age (15-59 years) population that received any formal vocational/technical training actually came down from 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 to 2 per cent in 2017-18. Among the youth (15-29 years), however, a jump of 0.1 per cent is recorded in the same time period.

16,One crore jobs in last year: Here is how PM Modi built his case during speech in Lok Sabha,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)

Rejecting criticism that the government failed to create enough jobs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said over one crore jobs were created in the country over the past one year. The PM, during no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha on Friday, mentioned the survey figures by an independent institute. To lend weight to his argument, he referred to employment figures available in the system including EPF, NPS, formal and informal sector. He talked about job growth and employment towards the end of his speech.

READ | No-confidence motion: How PM Modi and Rahul Gandhi pitched their lines for 2019

The PM said that many lies are being spread over the issue of unemployment in the country. ‚ÄúAgain, there is an attempt to trample the truth. There is no information but the opposition is just making baseless talks. Had they thoroughly looked into the matter (unemployment), they would not have committed the sin of playing politics by dashing the hopes of youths of the country,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced the government‚Äôs decision to publish job data every month. ‚ÄúThe government will present before the country all figures regarding employment present in the system, every month.‚Äù

This is how he tracked the employment and job growth in the last one year:

Employment in Formal sector- EPF, NPS data, Doctors, CAs, Lawyers

* ‚ÄúThere is a way to assess employment in the formal sector- through Employee Provident Fund (EPF),‚Äù he said, adding that in the nine months between September 2017 and May 2018, 45 lakh new subscribers had joined the EPFO, out of which 77 per cent were less than 28 years of age.

* The National Pension Scheme had attracted 5.68 lakh new subscribers during the same period. ‚ÄúTaking the EPF and NPS subscribers together, more than 50 lakh jobs were created in nine months,‚Äù he said, adding that this figure would reach 70 lakh for the whole year. PM Modi said data from the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIC) was not taken into account as Aadhar linking of subscribers was still underway.

* ‚ÄúBesides this, there are a number of professional bodies in the country from where young professionals register themselves and become self-independent. For example, doctors, engineers, architects, chartered accountants, company secretaries. According to the survey by an independent institute, 17,000 new Chartered Accountants have joined in the system. Of them, 5,000 have started new companies. If one Chartered Accountant institute provides employment to 20 people, then around 1 lakh CA‚Äôs must have got employment in such institutes.

* ‚ÄúIn our country, more than 80,000 postgraduate doctors, dental surgeons, and AYUSH doctors pass out of colleges every year. Of them, even if 60 per cent starts their own practice, then one doctor can provide employment to 5 other people, and this figure will be 2,40,000.

* In 2017, there were around 80,000 new undergraduate and postgraduate lawyers. Out of them, even if 60 per cent may have started their practice and provided employment to 2-3 people, then around 2 lakh new jobs are expected.

* ‚ÄúIn these three professions only (doctors, CAs and lawyers), more than 6 lakh people have got employment opportunity in 2017,‚Äù PM Modi said.

Informal sector: Transport sector including the sale of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and auto-rickshaws

* ‚ÄúNow if we talk about informal sector, then many people get employment in the transport sector. Last year, 7,60,000 commercial vehicles were sold. Even if we suppose that 25 per cent of this was a replacement of old vehicles, 5.7 lakh new vehicles were pressed into service for transporting goods. If one commercial vehicle has two people working on it, nearly 11.40 lakh jobs were created in this sector,‚Äù he said.

* If we see passenger vehicles, then this sale figure was 25,40,000. Out of that, if 25 per cent was a replacement of old vehicles, then 20 lakh new vehicles were on the roads. Even if 25 per cent of these new vehicles get a driver and conductor, then 5 lakh new jobs were created.

* Last year, 2, 55,000 autos were sold. Out of them, even if 10 per cent was a replacement of old autos, then around 2,30,000 autos were pressed into service last year. Since autos work in two shifts, three people get employed by 2 autos. In this way, 3,40,000 people got employment through new autos.

* In the transport sector alone, these three categories of vehicles have proved job opportunities to 20 lakh people, the PM said. ‚ÄúIf we combine all these figures from EPF, NPS, professions and transport sector, then around 1 crore new jobs were created in the last one year alone. This is conveyed through the survey of an independent institute. I am quoting that institute and not citing government data. Therefore, it is my request to not bury the truth without knowing the facts. There should be no effort to mislead the country in this regard,‚Äù the prime minister said in the Lok Sabha.

17,"Across the aisle: Governments hide, people seek","It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

How much can you hide behind one number? A lot, if the media played ball.

On the day after the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the growth numbers for 2017-18, the media played up just one number: 7.7 per cent. At first blush it appeared to be the GDP growth number for the whole year 2017-18, and was certainly impressive. Actually, it was the growth number for just one quarter, Q4, and the uptick was also because of the low base effect. For the whole year, however, the GDP growth rate was a sobering 6.7 per cent.

The government puffed up the Q4 growth rate and claimed that the worst effects of demonetisation and a flawed GST were over. Mercifully, the government stopped short of making the claim that achhe din had arrived. At the end of four years, the government has switched over to a modest Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas (Clean intention, right progress)!

The path of the BJP-led NDA government‚Äôs four-year journey is littered with too many broken promises: Rs 15 lakh in every bank account, 2 crore jobs, MSP at cost + 50 per cent, waiver of agricultural loans, insurance cover to all farmers, peace and security in Jammu and Kashmir, a good and simple GST, and many more. You can add to the list from your own experience.

Look at Outcomes

At the end of four of the five years allowed to a government, the people cannot be expected to judge a government by its intent. The correct test is outcomes. Look at the boxes with the graphs. Every line depicts a measurable parameter. And every line, after showing promise in the first year, has dipped.

Some conclusions can be drawn without fear of contradiction. Beginning 2012-13, the economy was on the mend, and the GDP growth rate accelerated from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 6.4 per cent in 2013-14 to 7.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 8.2 per cent in 2016-17. The story thereafter is one of steep decline. From 8.2 per cent to 6.7 per cent in two years, it is a fall of 1.5 per cent ‚Äî exactly what I had predicted after demonetisation.

Miserable Story

Other lines in the two boxes also tell the miserable story:

Credit growth dipped drastically from 13.8 per cent to 5.4 per cent before recovering somewhat in 2017-18. Within credit growth, it is credit to industry that is important. In the last four years, annual credit growth rates to industry were 5.6, 2.7, -1.9 and 0.7 per cent.

The index of industrial production (IIP) has remained flat. That number demolishes the claims on behalf of the much-touted Make in India programme. Besides, as far as defence production is concerned, the Make in India model was officially abandoned a few days ago (see Business Standard, June 6, 2018).

Gross NPAs have risen from Rs 2,63,015 crore to Rs 10,30,000 crore and will rise more. The banking system is practically bankrupt. I have not come across a banker who will willingly sanction a loan; nor an investor who will confidently borrow money. The economy is running on just one wheel ‚Äî government expenditure.

Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), after falling from 31.3 per cent in 2013-14 to 28.5 per cent in 2015-16, is stuck at the same level for three years, proving my point that private investment is in the doldrums.

Merchandise exports hit a peak of USD 315 billion in 2013-14. Since then, the figure has struggled to cross USD 300 billion and, in two out of the four years, it was well below the peak.

Mood of Despondency

We could pick up more economic indicators and draw the lines on a graph. It will be the same story of poor analysis and reckless decisions (demonetisation, flawed GST, stagnant farm wages, high fuel prices, intimidating tax recovery, mala fide investigations etc).

The mood of the nation is despondent. In the RBI‚Äôs survey (May 2018), 48 per cent of respondents felt that the economic situation had worsened in the last one year. In some sectors, like agriculture, despondency has turned into anger. Among some sections of the people, like Dalits and unemployed youth, despondency has turned into despair.

It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

18,"Congress to focus on agriculture, employment to challenge BJP","‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said (Representational Image) ‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said (Representational Image)

Ahead of polls in some states and the 2019 general elections, the Congress has decided to up the ante over issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty as it prepares to take on the ruling BJP, party sources said. For The Grand Old Party‚Äôs plenary session, to be held between March 16 and March 18 in the national capital, a separate resolution will be passed on issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty alleviation. During the last plenary session in 2010, agrarian and employment issues were part of the economic resolution.

The Congress has also formed a nine-member sub-group on ‚Äòagriculture, employment and poverty alleviation‚Äô under the chairmanship of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Party leader Meenakshi Natarajan is the convener of the sub-group.

‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said, requesting anonymity. This, however, is not the first time that the party will have a separate resolution on agrarian and employment-related issues. The leader added that the Congress had passed a similar resolution in 2001.

‚ÄúWe had taken enough measures to see these problems do not surface when we were in power (till 2014). The situation was better when we had the last plenary session,‚Äù the leader claimed. Another party insider said the issues of employment and poverty alleviation have become ‚Äúacute‚Äù over the past three years.

‚ÄúThe economy has been paralysed due to the government‚Äôs double blow of demonetisation and GST. We will have to reach out to the people on the issues,‚Äù the insider added. The leader said that the party has already started reaching out to the youth and first-time voters on issues concerning them, including that of employment.

19,Modi Government Does Not Acknowledge the Word 'Slowdown': Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: In a sharp attack on the Narendra Modi government over the state of the economy, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said the current dispensation does not acknowledge the word ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù, and the real danger is that if problems are not recognised, then finding credible answers to take corrective action is unlikely.

Addressing a gathering at the launch of Montek Singh Ahluwalia‚Äôs book Backstage: The Story behind India‚Äôs High Growth Years, Singh cited the former planning commission‚Äôs observations to state that achieving the target of $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù.

Singh said the former planning commission deputy chairman has written about the good as well as the weak points of the UPA government.

‚ÄúI think these issues will be debated and should be debated because we have today a government that does not acknowledge that there is such a word as slowdown. I think this is not good for our country,‚Äù the former prime minister said.

‚ÄúIf you do not recognise the problems that you face, you are not likely to find credible answers to take corrective action. That is the real danger,‚Äù he said, attacking the government on the state of the economy.

The book will be of great help to the future growth of the country, Singh said.

‚ÄúMontek has also pointed out that contrary to what the ruling group may say, today the $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking. Also there is no reason to expect that farmers‚Äô income will be doubled in a three- year period,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAt the same time, he (Ahluwalia) said we must work for high rate of growth and that 8% growth rate is a feasible proposition but it requires rethinking about the role of fiscal policy. There is a need for tax reforms in the country in a bolder way,‚Äù Singh said.

He also hailed the role played by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, P. Chidambaram and Ahluwalia for supporting his liberalisation of the economy in the 1990s and enabling him as the then finance minister to carry out the reforms despite resistance from different quarters.

Later, during a panel discussion at the book launch, former finance minister Chidambaram said former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs remarks that the Indian economy headed for intensive care unit, were ‚Äúnearly correct‚Äù.

‚ÄúI disagree in the following manner ‚Äì the patient (economy) is being wheeled into the ICU, the patient is being stopped just outside the ICU and is being looked at by incompetent doctors,‚Äù Chidambaram said in a dig at the government.

‚ÄúThere is no aggregate demand rise, unemployment is rising, consumption is falling‚Ä¶ Yet the government says all is well, which means we have to rewrite our textbooks of economics. Every indicator is pointing southward. If every indicator is pointing southward, how can the GDP rise to 7 or 8%,‚Äù he said.

Asked about his advice to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Chidambaram said, ‚ÄúPlease resign.‚Äù

Participating in the panel discussion with Chidambaram, Ahluwalia, and former RBI governor Y. Venugopal Reddy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister Bibek Debroy said there is a slowdown but if ‚Äúyou try to neatly pin that slowdown to something that happened in 2019 that is debatable‚Äù.

In his address, Manmohan Singh hoped that there will be consensus among right-thinking persons about the path that Ahluwalia had identified for dealing with the economic situation in the country.

Referring to the UPA years, he said, ‚ÄúThere will be question marks, there should be question marks and I hope there will be solid debate that will produce a better programme for carrying out the reform process further.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe that there is need for re-thinking of the reform process fresh. Second generation of reforms requires new pathways and these new pathways can emerge only with solid discussion of the alternatives,‚Äù he said.

Singh, who was the finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government rolled out the liberalisation policy, talked in detail about the resistance he faced at the time and the support he got from Rao.

‚ÄúWhen the reform period is written, I don‚Äôt know what the official narrative will be, but I for one know, it was a very tortuous path because the dominant opinion then was not in favour of reforms,‚Äù Singh said.

Singh said that in the business community there was the Bombay club which was formed to see that India does not move on the path of liberalisation, but he also knew that there was limited time due to dwindling reserves.

‚ÄúI had to tell president (then president) S Venkataraman that ‚ÄòMr president if we wait for a vote of confidence, I may have nothing to sell to the world about India‚Äôs story‚Äô,‚Äù Singh said.

‚ÄúI am very grateful to Prime Minister Rao that he stood by me. But I am also very grateful to Montek, to Chidambaram ji, to the then governor and deputy governor of the RBI who stood by me firmly so that we could carry out the reform process in the manner we wanted to,‚Äù he said.

During the panel discussion, Ahluwalia said there was no quiestion that India had entered a period of ‚Äúvery serious slowdown‚Äù.

He said that not only the drop in growth rate, but also rising unemployment among youth was a matter of concern.

Ahluwalia said he was against the restrospective taxation step of the UPA government, but it was not in his hands.

Chidambaram, in his remarks also acknowledged that the Congress party machinery had failed to take the economic achievements of the UPA years to the people."

As the year draws to a close, a sense of uncertainty and a feeling of resignation has slowly taken over our minds. One can argue rightly that this is a transitory phase. All the same, the doubts are refusing to die away.

The reason for doubt is quite apparent. All the critical economic numbers ‚Äì from GDP (gross domestic product) to inflation figure and trade data ‚Äì don‚Äôt give any reason for comfort. The quick slide in GDP number to below 4.5% from 8% in just four quarters is causing too much of an anxiety across policy planners and common man alike.

Poor IIP (Index of Industrial Production) numbers and weak consumption demand combine to sketch a distressing picture. Not surprisingly, the numbers on capital formation and investment have not shown any healthy growth. A former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has summed up the state of the economy quite nicely with a new term ‚Äì ‚Äúgrowth recession‚Äù.

What is equally concerning is that the portents appear to be not good, with the World Bank warning of a substantial risk in global trade and growth in advanced economies slowing down. With little headroom on the fiscal front, the Centre appears to have been caught in a pincer-like situation. With the political atmosphere heating up by the day in the wake of Citizenship Amendment Bill and following the victories by the opposition in two states, the Modi government has its plate full.

If the macroeconomic picture is turning out to be increasingly worrisome, events at the micro level are hurting significantly investor perception, causing further damage to the overall economy. The Reserve Bank of India was forced to refer Dewan Housing to the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). The Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank imbroglio, which erupted just on the eve of Maharashtra State Assembly elections, has cut short the life of nearly half-a-dozen depositors even as unmindful political parties slugged it out to claim the right, nay power, to rule the state.

Prior to all this was the IL&FS debacle, setting off a chain of adverse reaction triggering a negative multiplier impact on the overall health of the economy. All these suggest to a dipping confidence level all around. There was also this Karvy fiasco, which saw promoters misusing the power of attorney given by clients for illegal fund-rising activity. It did so by pledging the shares of its clients!

How did all these scandals happen? Do we blame it on the inherent rot in the system? Should promoters be held accountable? What were India‚Äôs regulators doing? Where were the responsible characters in the entire chain while all this was happening? In all these instances, the real losers were common Indians, either as depositors or investors of one kind or the other.

The effect of 2019‚Äôs scams on the micro-level was palpable and felt instantly. On top of this though was the continuing agrarian crisis, a cause for farmer suicides. Somewhere along, the Modi government appears to have either allowed the situation to drift or not really gotten a hang of these fast-engulfing issues. When confidence in the economy is short and the threat of job loss high, a consumer has very little option but to exercise prudent and live only an existential life. This is having a chain reaction not just down the line but up the stream as well. Production, investment and everything else is reeling under the impact of this.

When senior industrialist Rahul Bajaj bluntly voiced the fear psychosis among its peers to home minister Amit Shaw in an open forum, probably he was articulating the exasperation experienced by the business community in the prevailing economic conditions. The fear reference made by Bajaj was somewhat sweeping, yet he managed to hit the nail on the head.

Is time running out for the Modi government to drive its men, machinery and ministers towards providing ‚Äòroti, kapda and makaan‚Äò rather than dissipating its energy on other diversionary issues?

As we slip into 2020, this will be a key question. The NDA government‚Äôs job is cut out and its first priority must be to to steady the rocking economic ship. No doubt, this government has not diluted its reform agenda. The fine-tuning of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ‚Äì its evolution, the recent amendment and the Supreme Court verdict in the Essar Steel case ‚Äì all give a sense of optimism in addressing the stressed asset problem of banks. The government‚Äôs disinvestment agenda, move for labour reforms and the like are equally important. These will take a while though to see results on the ground.

The near-term misery, however, requires a quick fix. The writing on the wall is all too clear. Action is what matters and not speeches from political podiums. The onus is definitely on the government. If the government can‚Äôt, nobody else can.

21,Facing the Reality: How Can Modi Reverse the Current Economic Slowdown?,"That the Indian economy is witnessing a slowdown is no longer a matter of debate after the Union finance minister acknowledged this reality. The days when the Indian economy was the fastest growing seemed distant when the second quarter of 2019-20 saw the growth stumble to 4.5%, the slowest in 26 quarters.

The three drivers of growth, namely, consumption, investment, and exports, have all moved downward. Consumption was reported to be at a four-decade low, with rural consumption lower by 8.8%, while urban consumption barely increased. In the second quarter of the current fiscal, gross fixed capital formation (at constant prices) grew by a mere 1% over the corresponding period of 2018-19, while exports recorded negative growth.

These numbers, in our view, reflect the combined impact of four factors, namely, policy shocks, agrarian crisis, steep increase in unemployment and steady decline in the share of wages and financial sector crisis.

Except for the first, the remaining three are structural impediments that have plagued the economy in the past decades.

Two policy shocks, namely, demonetisation and introduction of GST, were imparted in rapid succession. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) were especially impacted by demonetisation having lost 1.5 million jobs, according to estimates provided by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. The woes of the MSME sector were exacerbated by a poorly designed GST, which added a significant layer of uncertainty for the small businesses. The jobs and income losses resulting from the policy shocks caused demand shrinkage and sharp decline of investment.

India‚Äôs development model is skewed against the interests of the farm sector; the steadily falling share of the sector in the country‚Äôs GDP even when it supports an overwhelmingly large section of the working population. In 2005, the National Farmers‚Äô Commission (NFC) emphasised the need for amelioration of the condition of the farming community, especially by increasing minimum support price (MSP) and by extending it for other major crops.

After an initial interest shown by the UPA government to meaningfully increase MSP, this recommendation of the NFC has remained unimplemented. Consequently, the terms of trade between farmers and non-farmers, which had increased up to 2010-11, declined thereafter. At the same time, wages received by farm labour also became less remunerative: they grew by an annual average of nearly 17% between 2007-08 and 2013-14, but in the past three years, their growth was halved. These two developments squeezed rural demand.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 reported massive decline in agricultural employment and very slow growth of non-agricultural jobs. The unemployment rate stood at 6.1%, of which unemployment rate among the urban male youth was nearly 19% while the unemployment rate for urban female youth was 27% per cent. These figures were the highest in 45 years. Worse still, the total employment witnessed a net decline to 471.3 million in 2017‚Äì18 from 472.5 million in 2012‚Äîthe first ever absolute decline in the post-independence period.

As for the urban sector, KLMES database produced by the RBI, shows that employment growth in manufacturing dropped to 1.4% and in services to 2% between 2011 and 2017 from 2.5% and 2.8 % respectively between 2004 and 2010. During the same period, labour earnings in the manufacturing sector declined from 8.1 % to 5.4% and in the services sector, from 7.2% to 6.1%.

Thus, falling rural income and urban labour earnings as well as skewed income distribution have resulted in domestic demand contraction while falling export growth has affected external demand.

Despite continuous capitalisation of the banking sector in the past several years (Rs 1.06 lakh crore in 2018‚Äì19 followed by Rs 70,000 crores in 2019‚Äì20), non-performing assets continued to grow. It stood at Rs 8.06 lakh crore on March 31, 2019. Even the non-banking financial sector is passing through a crisis. For example, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services has reported a negative net worth of Rs 16,935 crore in FY 19. These obviously adversely affected commercial credit off-takes. Financial sector crisis, together with demand slackness and investor pessimism have negatively impacted investment.

The government has taken several initiatives, including cut in corporation tax and announcement of packages for reviving sectors like the real estate, automobiles and exports. Ironically, all these are essentially supply-side measures, which would make no impact on a demand-constrained economy.

What should the government have done instead? Putting purchasing power in the pockets of those having high marginal propensity to consume should have received the topmost priority. This can easily be done through increased spending on schemes like MGNREGA, and by investing in education, health services and rural infrastructure. Such spending can immediately spur demand, which in turn would create inducement for potential investors.

In an exercise evaluating the impact of MGNREGA and two other social security schemes using the Social Accounting framework, we found that the indirect impact of expenditure on such schemes is considerable. Direct expenditure on a scheme like MGNREGA induces 1.8 times increase in indirect income and twice the direct expenditure in pension or basic income type scheme.

The government can garner enough resources for financing the above-mentioned initiatives by realising the undisputed part of tax and non-tax arrears, which, at the end of 2017-18, were around Rs 9 lakh crore and Rs 2 lakh crores respectively. It could also monetise the huge chunk of surplus land available with the Ministries of Defence and Railways, which was one of the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

Over the medium-term, efforts must be made to increase the tax-GDP ratio, which is the lowest among major economies, by levying wealth tax, among others. Besides, the GST must be reviewed and redesigned through reduction in the number of tax rates and increasing the base, and by improving the GST Network that the indirect tax system needs in order to be effective. All these measures would boost demand which in turn induce investment and reverse the downward trajectory of economic growth.

22,"Opposition Says Budget 2020 Does Not Address Unemployment, Slowing Growth","New Delhi: While most leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party termed Budget 2020 as ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù and ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù, opposition leaders panned it as lacking any concrete ideas to address problems such as rising unemployment and plummeting growth rate.

Soon after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman finished the Budget speech, one of the longest in recent history, the BJP claimed that it addressed development for all sections of the society, on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas slogan.

‚Äú#JanJanKaBudget‚Äù: Union Budget 2020 ensures all-round development of all sections of the society. It will further fulfil PM Shri @narendramodi‚Äòs vision of making India a $5 trillion economy. https://t.co/CxTEgSCLeF ‚Äî BJP (@BJP4India) February 1, 2020



Within minutes, leaders from the saffron party took turns on Twitter to trend their praise with #JanJanKaBudget. However, not many pointed out why they felt it was visionary or futuristic.

PM Modi congratulated Sitharaman for preparing a Budget which he called was a mix of ‚Äúvision and action‚Äù. He went on to list out new reforms announced in the Budget.



The opposition leaders had concrete criticisms to offer.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ‚ÄúOur youth want jobs. Instead they got the longest budget speech in parliamentary history that said absolutely nothing of consequence. PM & FM both looked like they have absolutely no clue what to do next.‚Äù He said there was no central idea to rid India of unemployment or improve the poor state of the economy.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said that the Budget was ‚Äútoo long to absorb‚Äù.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P. Chidambaram briefed the media after the Budget. He said, ‚ÄúThere were multiple themes, segments and programmes, leaving the listener dazed and confused. It was a laundry list of old (that is current) programmes‚Ä¶ The government has given up on reviving the economy or accelerating the growth rate or promoting private investment or increasing efficiency or creating jobs or winning a greater share of world trade.‚Äù

Also Read: Budget 2020 Sidesteps the Question of What the Govt Should Do to Revive the Economy

‚ÄúThe Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved. The FM has not acknowledged these two challenges, and that is a pity,‚Äù he said, adding that the government was ‚Äúin complete denial that the economy faces a grave macro economic challenge and the growth rate has declined in six successive quarters.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is nothing in the Budget that leads us to believe that growth will revive in 2020-21. The claim of 6-6.5% growth next year is astonishing and even irresponsible,‚Äù he said.

As an advocate of market economy, he lashed out at the government for adhering to protectionist policies. However, he also criticised it for reducing food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies.

‚ÄúIt appears that the people will not get any relief on the price front. Please remember that CPI inflation is over 7% and food inflation is over 10%,‚Äù he said, adding there is no assurance that the finance minister will meet the targets set for 2020-21.

He also said that the government rejected every reform idea contained in the Economic Survey. ‚ÄúDid the FM read the Economic Survey? Was the chief economic adviser privy to the contents of the Budget speech? I think the answer to both questions is in the negative.‚Äù

Government clueless: CPI(M)

Calling the government ‚Äúclueless‚Äù about how to address the current economic crisis, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Modi Government is only interested in providing the corporate sector and the wealthy relief rather than tackling the increasingly grim employment and livelihood situations of the working people ‚Äì workers, farmers and those forced into self-employment ‚Äì which is the root cause of the slowdown.‚Äù

It said that instead of increasing its social spending to address the demand crunch, the Budget has only aimed at ‚Äúreducing the fiscal deficit by further slashing government expenditures‚Ä¶the burden of which will be felt by working people.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶the expenditures on Central Sector Schemes in 2019-20 has been slashed by 11 per cent and Centrally Sponsored Schemes by 4.5 per cent ‚Äì covering areas like ‚Äì food subsidies, agriculture and allied activities, Development of the North-East, Social Welfare, Energy, etc. In the cuts proposed in 2020-21, MNREGA (Rs. 61,500 crore from Rs. 71,000 crore) and fertilizer subsidies are slated to join this list. Even the flagship schemes like PMJAY-Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat and PM-Kisan have suffered major cuts. Allocations for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, already way below the statutory requirements, have been cut in 2019-20. The Gender Budget allocation for 2020-21 similarly shows stagnation,‚Äù the Left party said in its statement, also adding that the government manipulated revised estimates of revenue figures.

‚ÄúRevised Estimates (RE) figures show that the revenue collections in 2018-19 are way below the Budget Estimates (BE), still they underestimate the extent of the shortfall. The RE figures of Central Tax Revenues are incompatible with the actual collections reported by the CGA for April-December of 2019-20. A realistic RE would have shown a further shortfall of close to 1.5 lakh crores in gross revenues from central taxes.‚Äù

He said even at the time of such high unemployment rate, funds for MGNREGS was slashed by 13%.

He also lashed out at the government‚Äôs proposals to indirectly privatise BSNL and LIC. ‚ÄúMore importantly, the LIC sale would be used to compensate the states on GST. What‚Äôs going on,‚Äù he asked. He also criticised the government‚Äôs move to remove at least 70 exemptions that people used to save income tax.

23,Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚ÄòBudget of Giveaways‚Äô Will Not Help India's Broken Economy,"It could have been the best budget India had had in the past decade. And the shortest. Instead, it was the worst and the longest. Early in January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a quiet meeting with fifteen of India‚Äôs top industrialists to get their views on how to revive the economy. Apologising to them, for not having met them earlier, and not being able to meet them one-on-one even now, for shortage of time, he said:

‚ÄúPlease treat this as 15 one-on-one meetings, and tell me exactly what you believe will start the economy growing again. Please take as much time as you want. I will take notes on what you say.‚Äù

And that is what he did. There was a junior officer from the PMO in a corner of the room, who took notes. Halfway through the meeting, Modi began to take notes himself.

Among the industrialists, a consensus emerged on three issues: the need to revive stalled infrastructure projects instead of abandoning them and starting afresh, as new projects would prove far more expensive and take longer to complete; to make this possible by re-creating a purely investment bank on the lines of the old Industrial Development Bank of India, fund it to the tune of Rs 200,000 crore or thereabouts and get it to buy a large portion of the shares of the stressed companies, so that they became viable once more; and to bring down the GST from the present average of 22% to 15%, as had originally been suggested by Arvind Subramaniam, among others, when he was the chief economic adviser.

One other ingredient needed to complete the formula for recovery ‚Äì a further sharp lowering of lending rates by commercial banks to enable stressed companies to refinance their accumulated debt at a lower rate of interest (as the state governments had done after A.B. Vajpayee‚Äôs finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, had slashed lending rates in 2001 and 2002) remained unresolved. But had Nirmala Sitharaman even announced the other three measures, the Sensex would have shot up by 1,000 points instead of falling by an equal amount.

But Sitharaman was not present at the meeting. Nor was there any hint in the Economic Survey that she might have been briefed by the prime minister. Indeed the absence of any meaningful coordination between the PMO and the Ministry of Finance was visible in the Economic Survey, presented yesterday, for the survey once again described the economic crisis as a ‚Äòcyclical slowdown‚Äô, and recommended what is usually called ‚Äòpump priming‚Äô ‚Äì an infusion of spending power into the economy to boost demand. And that is about all that Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚Äòbudget of giveaways‚Äô will achieve.

Spending power and economic recovery

Will more spending power suffice to trigger an economic recovery. The drop in the Sensex shows that the market knows it will not. For what India is in the throes of is not a (trade) cyclical slowdown but an economic breakdown. Cyclical slowdowns automatically reverse themselves of one waits long enough. Two centuries of experience of the industrialised market economies has shown that the usual trade cycle rarely takes more than seven years to complete itself. India‚Äôs ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù ‚Äì the so-called downward phase of this ‚Äúcycle‚Äù, is now in its ninth year. It is therefore time for this government to concede that India is suffering not an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown.

Also Read: With No Big Bang Steps, Budget 2020 Focuses on Untangling the Fiscal Math Mess

Clinging to the politically convenient belief that all we are suffering from is a slowdown has prevented the government from even mapping, let alone applying, the remedies that are needed to re-start economic growth. For all that it has done so far is to get the RBI to bring its main policy interest rate, the Repo rate, down from 6.5% to 5.15% between February and October 2019. This has, predictably, done nothing to halt the slide down in India‚Äôs GDP growth rate from 6.8% in 2018-19 to an expected 4.9% this year.

The blame for this is now being put upon commercial banks, who are being castigated for passing on less than a third of this rate cut to borrowers. But the policy making apparatus of the RBI and the Ministry of Finance has shied away from asking why they are not doing so. The answer, which they undoubtedly know but are not willing to discuss, is that such a large proportion of their loans is now irrecoverable, that they are no longer able to meet their interest commitments to depositors and various government subsidisation programmes. They cannot therefore be blamed for fearing that a further reduction of lending rates will tip them into the red.

How has India‚Äôs vibrant economy been broken? The single, short answer is, ‚Äòby a regime of monstrously high rates of interest born out of the RBI‚Äôs unquestioning, and economically stupid, adoption of the doctrine of ‚Äúinflation targeting‚Äù. This doctrine was coined in 1992 by the Bank of England and adopted with alacrity by industrialised countries and the IMF because it yielded not only price but also exchange rate stability. The rich nations needed the latter even more than the former because it was an absolute pre-requisite for maintaining their currencies as the reserve currencies of the world, and attracting the export surpluses, and private savings of the wealthy in the rest of the world as capital transfers into their banks. Faced with de-industrialisation, a shrinking tax base and mounting social security commitments to an ageing population at home, these inflows were essential for allowing them to continue living beyond their shrinking means.

To the rich nations, price stability was the end in itself, so knowing the cause of the inflation was not important. But for developing countries knowing whether it was an excess of demand or shortages of supply was a matter of life and death. For imposing high interest rates on an economy where prices were rising because of shortages of supply could only worsen the shortages and push up prices further. In short inflation targeting in a shortage ridden economy produced not growth but stagflation.

If stagflation is allowed to persist long enough, it ends not in an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown. That is what India is in the throes of today. By the middle of 2018, India had Rs 1,160,000 crores worth of abandoned projects, nearly all in infrastructure and heavy industry; the public sector banks had more than Rs 9,60,000 crores of irrecoverable debt and had lost their capacity to lend, and this had created a funds crisis in the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) sector, which oiled the wheels of the economy through its various rapid payment systems.

The capacity and willingness to take risk

What was worse, eight years of relentless inflation targeting by the RBI, begun in March 2010, had ended by destroying entrepreneurship ‚Äì the capacity and willingness to take risk, which is the essential fourth requirement of modern economic growth (after land, labour and capital). By June 2018, 78 of the largest companies in the country were facing dissolution under the Indian Bankruptcy Code. Of them, 20 had already been declared insolvent and sent to the National Company Law Tribunal for dissolution.

Another 30 companies, all in the power sector, were facing the same fate because the Allahabad high court had denied them more time to sort out their woes. The debt of these companies alone amounted to Rs 140,000 crore. Another 92 companies were headed for the chopping block because they were more than 180 days behind on their loan repayments. And loan defaults by small companies had doubled in the previous 12 months, heralding the NBFC financial crisis that burst into the open at the end of the year.

Since then, things have grown dramatically worse. Nirmala Seetharaman‚Äôs budget could be the Indian economy‚Äôs death.

24,"As India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown Deepens, Is It Time to Reconsider Cash Transfers to the Poor?","India‚Äôs precarious economic situation has everyone worried and rightly so. Two weeks ago, we got news that India‚Äôs nominal GDP growth is at its lowest in 45 years. Even that is perhaps a rosier picture than the ground reality according to the former chief economic advisor of the Narendra Modi government who has cast doubts over GDP measurement and said that the measured GDP is overstated. There is simply no dispute that India‚Äôs economic growth has collapsed, regardless of how and who measures it. So, what is the way out of this mess?

Several economic commentators, finance ministers and Nobel laureates are now in consensus about the remedy: stimulating demand in the economy. Nobel laureate Esther Duflo recently called for a ‚ÄòTUP‚Äô policy ‚Äì targeting the ultra-poor by giving them cash which they will spend immediately. Bengal‚Äôs finance minister Amit Mitra in a recent interview specifically called for a direct cash transfer to the poorest sections of society to stimulate consumption. Another Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said that the situation is so egregious that fiscal deficit concerns should not be a hurdle to boosting demand through a stimulus package. Nearly every major newspaper has carried an editorial calling for a demand stimulus. Never before has there been such an overwhelming consensus in an economic policy prescription for the country across all hues of commentators.

Also Read: Budget 2020: Here Are Five Challenges Nirmala Sitharaman Is Facing

Not too long ago, there was precisely such an idea proposed for the Indian economy. An idea to target 20% of the poorest households in every district in the country and give them a direct cash transfer of Rs 6,000 a month which would then stimulate demand and revive private investment, which in turn would lead to more jobs and a healthier economy. The idea was called NYAY, which was part of the manifesto of the Congress party for the 2019 parliament elections.

The Congress party diagnosed the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy, assembled a group of experts, and presented a solution to pull the nation out of the impending economic crisis. In fact, the party believed in it so strongly that NYAY became the centrepiece of the campaign, contrary to some recent fallacious narratives that the economy was not the focus of the Congress party‚Äôs campaign.

Of course, the party could not convince voters, either because the NYAY message did not reach enough people or voters did not believe the message. Regardless, just nine months later, the same idea to revive a sagging economy by stimulating demand through cash transfers to the poor is now a consensus prescription.

The Modi government should not be churlish to dismiss this consensus solution of experts to pull our economy out of distress, only because the Congress party originated the idea. Economics and governance should transcend politics. The ‚ÄòSarva Shiksha Abhiyan‚Äô was pioneered by the Vajpayee government and carried forward by all successive governments, the Aadhaar programme was mooted by the Congress party and continued by the Modi government amid many such examples of policy ideas adopted across governments and political parties. NYAY, in perhaps a different shape and form, remains the most relevant solution to our current economic crisis and the Modi government should embrace it.

The Modi government has been whimsical and knee-jerk in their prescriptions for the economic crisis, like a deer caught in headlights. Out of the blue, one day in September, just before the prime minister embarked on his visit to the US, the finance minister announced a steep reduction in corporate tax rates and claimed that it would cost the exchequer nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore and help revive the economy. Even a cursory analysis would have revealed that a corporate tax cut at this juncture would only be used by corporates to reduce their loan liabilities and not to invest more in capacity building since consumer demand is very weak.

If using the same amount, had five crore poorest households been given say Rs 5,000 a month for six months, the poor would have spent it immediately, fueling demand and reviving private investment. Of course, such a move would not have elicited the blaring headlines in the media the next day that the corporate tax cut announcement did. Four months later, it is now acknowledged that the corporate tax cuts were mere hogwash.

Why can‚Äôt states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab or Chhattisgarh ‚Äì governed by the Congress party ‚Äì implement NYAY is the other common refrain one hears. NYAY was conceived as a scheme that will be implemented by both the Centre and states, which would give it the required fiscal capacity. Post-GST, state governments have lost all powers of generating their own tax revenues for state-specific programmes. So, even if say, the Rajasthan government wants to raise taxes on other goods to generate funds for cash transfer to the poor, it cannot do so.

In fact, a democratically elected chief minister of a state in today‚Äôs India has almost no powers to raise revenues for her state since both direct and indirect taxes are controlled by the Centre or the GST Council. Hence, a scheme like NYAY cannot be implemented at the state level any longer, which is a travesty of federalism.

The keys to the solution to India‚Äôs current economic catastrophe is only with the Union government in Delhi. The solution is to revive demand by putting money in the hands of the poor.

Our analysis for NYAY showed that it is both possible to target the poorest households as well as pay for the scheme through a combination of expenditure rationalisation and a modest fiscal expansion. The PM needs to act boldly and decisively. Now is not the time to indulge in petty quibbles over ownership of ideas. Let us all agree that good policy ideas belong to the people of the nation.

25,Economic Slump: India‚Äôs Rickety Bridge Over Troubled Waters,"Raghuram Rajan, the-then outgoing Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in an exit interview he granted to Karan Thapar (‚ÄòTo The Point‚Äô, YouTube, September 2, 2016), took satisfaction from the fact that India was ‚Äúon a more sustainable growth path‚Äù.

The remark turned out to be premature. Less than two years later, starting the first quarter of FY 18/19, ominous signs of weaknesses started to emerge. GDP growth, which has been sliding continuously over six quarters, reached 4.5% per annum in the second quarter of FY 19/20. The slide may not be over yet.

If engineers inspecting a bridge find serious structural weaknesses, they can only conclude that the bridge is unsafe. But, their science cannot predict when the bridge will come down. Similarly, a detailed analysis of structural economic weaknesses cannot predict the timing of the next slump. Economists can at best be faulted for not being cognizant enough of the risks to the sustainability of growth.

The euphoria about India‚Äôs prospects following the economic reforms of 1991 is understandable. After all, growth had averaged just about 3.5% per annum in the pre-reform period. Moreover, the economy‚Äôs performance was more volatile with brief spurts in growth punctuated by painful crashes. The opening up of the economy through less state intervention not only ratcheted growth upwards to about 7% per annum on average, they came with far less volatility.

According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), some 271 million Indians were lifted out of poverty between 2005/06 and 2016/17. Reports issued by various large US multinational companies like Cisco, Citi and PwC held out the possibility that India would become the second-largest economy in the world after China and possibly an advanced country by 2050. The findings were reported by several major international and Indian newspapers.

Laudable as those achievements were, growth was not inclusive. While the top 1% of earners walked away with 22% of national income, the top 10% accounted for a whopping 56%. Had growth been inclusive, the resulting rise in incomes and opportunities would have been equitably shared by all income groups sharply reducing inequality over time. It is not surprising why attaining inclusive growth is far more difficult than boosting growth rates themselves.

Why India‚Äôs growth story is not sustainable

In a recent article (Why Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste? What India Needs to Remember to Overcome its Economic Slump, The Wire, November 20, 2019), I pointed out that corruption and poor governance have not only spawned rising income inequality but a host of other economic maladies as well. I was not trying to explain the downturn in terms of some recent developments like the collapse in consumption. Rather, I was referring to the structural weaknesses in the Indian economy as the genesis of India‚Äôs current economic predicament.

While it is possible for highly corrupt countries to register impressive rates of growth for a few years, widespread and entrenched corruption will thwart the sustainability of growth. Studies by the IMF and other international organisations point out a number of serious consequences of corruption.

First, corruption reduces the rate of growth. As a result, poverty in India could have been reduced at a faster pace were it not for corruption. The United Nations, based on data produced by the World Economic Forum, noted that the worldwide cost of corruption is at least 5% of global GDP.

Also read: The Short-Term and Long-Term Measures Needed to Reverse India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown

Second, as I noted earlier, weakly governed countries tend to invest far less in health and education than strongly-governed ones. Thus, when growth takes place, only the elites can take advantage of the expanded opportunities whereas the vast majority cannot qualify for well-paid jobs in the organised sector. They are left with little alternative but to eke out a living working in low-skill jobs in the informal sector. In short, countries with endemic corruption also tend to be highly unequal.

In fact, income inequality based on officially reported incomes collected through household income surveys significantly understate actual inequality. This is because the upper income groups, who are the main drivers of black money incomes and assets, understate their incomes in household surveys conducted by the government. If reported incomes were to include black money incomes generated from domestic and foreign assets, actual inequality would be worse than calculated inequality based on official income data.

The greater actual inequality would have a larger destabilising effect than the measures available to economists would suggest. Assuming demonetisation left corruption intact, domestic black monies transferred abroad would return another day as inflows to drive up the stock market and other investments. Such round-tripping is often an elaborate scheme to launder dirty money.

Black money is mainly used to finance illegal and speculative transactions rather than boost productive investments in the official economy. In fact, while legitimate domestic investments have been on a declining trend, inflows of black money did nothing to help the economy. Regardless of how much black money was captured and surrendered to banks and how much could be traced to illegal activities, corruption cannot be curtailed without strengthening governance in all its aspects such as rule of law, effectiveness of regulatory oversight, quality and stability of politics, etc. To claim that demonetisation will curtail corruption is like putting on a winter jacket and expecting it to snow.

Third, wide-spread corruption leads to tax evasion by promoting a culture that tolerates the practice. The IMF finds that even among developed countries, strongly-governed ones collect about 4.5% of GDP more than relatively more corrupt ones. And that‚Äôs a lot of money the government could have used productively. The longer corruption rules, the more difficult it gets to dislodge it. In fact, as I have argued in my earlier article, corruption has restricted India‚Äôs fiscal space thereby significantly limiting the scope of a consumption-boosting targeted basic income.

Fourth, corruption has reduced the effectiveness of government services through bribery, a reduction in compliance with government regulations, and the imposition of additional costs on investment projects. India‚Äôs ‚ÄúD‚Äù rated government effectiveness has led to a lack of public trust in officials and the quality of government services. This in turn promotes tax evasion because taxpayers do not feel that they are getting their money‚Äôs worth.

Fifth, researchers at the IMF found that child and infant mortality rates as well as the proportion of low-birthweight babies in countries with endemic corruption are much higher compared to countries where corruption is low. Moreover, school dropout rates are five times as high partly due to less effective government spending. The poor quality of public school education in India is consistent with these findings.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis.

Finally, highly corrupt countries tend to be much more polluted than countries that are strongly governed. India is a perfect example of the nexus between rampant corruption and serious environmental degradation.

The tendency towards greater pollution is explained by the poor law and order, lack of environmental awareness, weak environmental regulations and their enforcement, bribery of regulatory officials, and a dearth of equipment and trained manpower to monitor compliance with regulations.

Hence, it is crucial to attain economic growth that is not only inclusive but environmentally sustainable as well. Inclusive policies by themselves cannot ensure that industries would comply with policies to protect the environment.

Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University, finds that the fault lies in formulating economic policies which do not treat fresh water, clean air, and land as resources which could be depleted in the production process. Given that no country has an inexhaustible supply of these resources, there is a dire need for appropriate regulation, monitoring for compliance, and user fees to pay for clean-up and renewal. His work shows that environmental degradations will effectively derail economic growth if policies are not designed to take explicit account of these consequences.

Also read: GDP Data: Investment Growth at 19-Quarter Low Despite Modi Govt‚Äôs Stimulus Measures

This is not to suggest that growth strategies necessarily need to evolve from a low to a higher trajectory through reform before they can be inclusive as well as sustainable. Countries like Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan which made significantly larger investments in health and education were not only successful in ensuring more equitable outcomes and opportunities when growth occurred but have also avoided environmental degradation from limiting growth in the long run.

The primacy of volition

Even though structural issues are deeply embedded and take far longer to mitigate than counter-cyclical policies aimed at stimulating the economy, here too governments can do a lot more than pray.

Vito Tanzi, a fiscal expert and one-time director of the IMF‚Äôs fiscal affairs department, in an article on corruption around the world, opined that successful efforts against corruption typically begin with examples set by a country‚Äôs leadership. Top political leaders should not only provide the right example of honest living but should support stern legal action against corruption from any quarter regardless of political affiliations. If, on the other hand corrupt acts by friends, relatives, or political associates are condoned, then it would not be realistic to expect that public officials or indeed the country at large will behave honestly.

The first step on the road to redemption is therefore the hardest one‚Äîleaders should set the right example, help support the appropriate laws, and implement a distinct plan for tackling corruption in all its manifestations. In short, the anti-corruption agenda must be strongly underwritten by the country‚Äôs leadership and the state governments as well. India needs to reduce corruption on a credible and sustained basis in order to better cushion the impact of difficult global economic conditions.

Global economic headwinds

In October, the IMF cut its forecast for this year‚Äôs global growth to 3.0% from 3.9% in January. Strong headwinds facing major economies such as geopolitical instability, business uncertainties, tariffs, and trade tensions, were responsible for the more somber outlook. The US Federal Reserve Bank began to cut its overnight lending rate to banks in July this year. The lending rate was lowered in three steps to a target range of 1.5 to 1.75% in October.

With the European Central Bank‚Äôs policy rate already in negative territory, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cuts were accompanied by a significant decline in long-term bond yields. Stock markets are surging because of falling long-term interest rates and higher bond prices, not in spite of them.

Also read: The Dangers of Dismantling India‚Äôs Public Sector

The reason is investors have nowhere to place their funds to make a decent return other than in stock markets and other riskier investments, thereby driving their growth. So, there is no contradiction between weakening economies on the one hand and surging stock markets on the other.

While the easy money of central banks is meant to prop up slackening economic growth, the downside is that low interest rates are encouraging households to incur more debt and firms to take on greater financial risks. The corporate sector in India is carrying a heavy debt load and some may default on their loan repayments and fold, while others may require a rollover of debt or some sort of corporate debt restructuring.

Conclusion

We can expect the world economy to enter a protracted period of low growth, low demand, and low-inflation, its driving gear stuck in neutral. While well-heeled investors and pension funds around the world have earned handsome returns in the soaring stock markets and other riskier assets, these are dark waters.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis and impose a heavy cost in terms of lost output, income, and jobs, along with an increasing risk of economic and political instability. These structural weaknesses need to be addressed on an urgent basis.

26,"In World's Biggest Early Childcare Scheme, Workers Don't Even Get Minimum Wage","Mysuru, Tumakuru and Ballari, Karnataka: The mud-and-bamboo anganwadi is about three kilometres from her house, deep inside the Nagarhole National Park and Tiger Reserve in Mysuru district, Karnataka. But little keeps Sita B., a young Yerwa tribe woman, from walking the distance every day to the Manamelkudi village anganwadi, where she works as worker and helper.

On the way, she picks up fresh vegetables and eggs to serve 14 children of the Jenu Kuruba tribe, aged three to six years, registered with the anganwadi. There are nine more children aged six months to three years, and Sita gives them their monthly share of take-home rations under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme of the Government of India.

ICDS is the world‚Äôs largest programme for early childhood care and development, with over 158 million children (2011 Census) in the 0-6 years age group, and pregnant and lactating mothers in the country. It offers six services: supplementary nutrition, preschool non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-up and referral services, through 1.36 million functional anganwadi centres spread across all the districts in the country (as of June 2018).

¬ß

According to the Union health ministry‚Äôs Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-2018, 32.5% of children younger than five years in Karnataka are stunted (lower height for age) and 12.4% are severely stunted. Over 32% are underweight (lower weight for age) and 19.3% are wasted (lower weight for height). A little over 34% of children aged one to four years also have anaemia.

The national scenario isn‚Äôt better. The same survey found that 35%, 33% and 17% of children under five in the country are stunted, underweight and wasted, respectively. About 11% of children aged six to 59 months months were in fact found to be acutely malnourished.

The Karnataka state department of women and child development has launched multiple schemes to fight malnutrition and is implementing them through anganwadi centres. For example, under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme, children aged six months to six years receive 150 ml of cream milk five days a week, supplied by the state government at a cost of Rs 124.14 crore per annum.

As part of the Srusti programme, children aged three to six years at anganwadi centres are provided eggs twice a week. Severely malnourished children aged six months to three years are provided eggs three days a week, whereas severely malnourished children aged three years to six years are offered eggs five days a week.

Apart from its 50% share under the ICDS, the Karnataka government gives Rs 11.50 per pregnant and lactating woman under Mathrupoorna, a scheme that grants nutritious meals, counselling and other healthcare facilities to pregnant and lactating women at anganwadi centres for six days a week.

Families with children who have severe acute malnutrition receive Rs 2,000 in medical benefits, plus Rs 1,000 a year for medicine kits at each anganwadi centre in the state.

The data suggests all these schemes together have had appreciable effect. For instance, 36.2% of children under five in Karnataka were stunted according to the 2015-2016 National Family Health Survey and 32.5% in the 2016-2018 survey. Similarly, wasting in children younger than five years has dropped from 26.1% in 2015-2016 to 19.3% in 2016-2018, and the fraction of underweight children has dropped from 35.2% to 32%.

These achievements also highlight the centrality of anganwadi centres ‚Äì and the women who work there ‚Äì to the state‚Äôs ambitions regarding the health and care of its most vulnerable people.

The ICDS population norms specify one centre for a population of 800 and a mini-anganwadi for a population of 150 to 300. According to the state department of women and child development, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi centres: 62,580 are main and 3,331 are mini-centres.

These centres are staffed by frontline health staff: one anganwadi worker and one anganwadi helper each, both typically women. Thus, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi workers and 62,580 anganwadi helpers. All the anganwadis together cater to the needs of 3.86 million children between the ages of six months to six years.

¬ß

The tribal village of Manamelkudi is home to 42 Jenu Kuruba tribe families and has a mini-anganwadi centre, where Sita works as worker and helper both.

‚ÄúI have been working at the Manamelkudi anganwadi for the last five years and am used to walking three kilometres to the centre [every day]. Sometimes I feel scared of tiger or elephant attacks, which are common in [the] forest area,‚Äù Sita told The Wire. She receives a monthly honorarium of Rs 4,750.

Managing children, their daily meals, preschool lessons, health and hygiene, and counselling pregnant and lactating mothers isn‚Äôt easy because she has to do it all alone. (Per ICDS norms, there can be only one worker-cum-helper per mini-anganwadi.)

However, Sita has been able to make sure the children in her anganwadi eat their meals hot, cooked freshly by her, and drink clean water. She also regularly monitors their growth and records the information in their respective growth charts. Unfortunately, the Manamelkudi anganwadi does not have a toilet.

Not very far away lies Balle, another Jenu Kuruba tribal village lying inside the Nagarhole National Park. It has two anganwadi centres and both function from the same tin-shed structure, without a toilet.

‚ÄúOur anganwadis [have been] operating since 2010, when they were located inside a government school building,‚Äù Pushpa, one of the anganwadi workers. ‚ÄúA few years ago, the school building collapsed but the forest department didn‚Äôt permit new construction, so we are functioning out of a tin-shed structure.‚Äù

Sharda, the other worker, said the forest department had recently okayed a new anganwadi building and that it was expected to come up soon.

There are about 14 anganwadi centres functioning inside the boundaries of the Nagarhole forest. This isn‚Äôt easy. There is a constant threat of animal attack, and the anganwadi workers and helpers come from houses located far away. It is difficult to find educated local tribal women to work at an anganwadi because a worker has to be college-educated and an anganwadi helper has to have studied till at least class IV.

It is women like Sita, Sharda, Pushpa and thousands more who form the backbone of the ICDS scheme.

As it happens, they are not happy.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding the legal minimum wage from the government but the Central government has been deaf to our demands,‚Äù S. Varalakshmi, president of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers‚Äô Association, told The Wire. ‚ÄúIt is not ready to compensate us adequately for the labour and the number of hours we put in.‚Äù

In April 2017, Karnataka raised the honoraria for anganwadi workers and helpers from Rs 4,000 and Rs 3,000 a month to Rs 8,000 and Rs 4,000 a month, respectively. The state government also reimburses their medical expenses to the tune of Rs 50,000 a year and provides pension. Additionally, the state department of women and child development has supplied twin-burner stoves, LPG cylinders and water filters to all anganwadi centres in the state.

Last October, the state government decided to further increase the monthly salaries of anganwadi workers and helpers to Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively, and of mini-anganwadi to about Rs 6,500. ‚ÄúThe state government has sanctioned higher honoraria but the same have not been implemented thus far due to some technical glitches,‚Äù Varalakshmi said. ‚ÄúIt is expected to be fixed soon.‚Äù

However, the Union ministry of women and child development has approved a much lower salary amount. In September 2018, it issued a circular on ‚Äúenhancement of honorarium‚Äù of anganwadi workers from Rs 3,000 per month to Rs 4,500 per month. The pay for anganwadi helpers was raised from Rs 1,500 per month to Rs 2,250 per month. For mini-anganwadi worker-cum-helper, the ministry approved just Rs 3,500 per month.

Varalakshmi alleged the Centre was trying to push the entire burden onto the states. ‚ÄúEarlier, the honorarium for anganwadi workers and helpers was shared between Centre and the states in the ratio of 90:10. Now, the Centre has revised it to 60:40,‚Äù she said. According to her, anganwadi workers should get at least Rs 18,000 per month and helpers Rs 9,000 per month. Kerala is the only state that provides minimum wages to all workers. The Goa government offers a monthly salary of about Rs 13,000, and both Haryana and Andhra Pradesh give Rs 11,000 per month.

Is this enough?

Anganwadi workers and helpers in various states, including Karnataka, have been demanding a raise. Last December, anganwadi workers across Karnataka launched a protest against the state government‚Äôs decision to start pre-primary classes in government schools . There were protests in Belagavi for delays in the release of incentives for anganwadi workers and helpers.

¬ß

The Karnataka government has a ‚Äòconvergence‚Äô programme as part of which it uses funds allocated for the fulfilment of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) to build anganwadi centres in the state.

For example, the anganwadi in Somlara village of Tumakuru district is 14 years old. For the first 12, it operated out of a rented space against a payment of Rs 700 per month. Two years ago, the government erected a new anganwadi building with Rs 6 lakh from MGNREGA funds.

‚ÄúOne of the villagers donated four gunthe of land to construct the anganwadi. Children love the new anganwadi and parents are also happy sending them here,‚Äù T.K. Bhagyamma, the anganwadi worker at Somlara, told The Wire.

At Giriyammanapalya village in Madhugiri, Reshma has been managing an anganwadi centre since 2007. ‚ÄúUntil April 2018, I was running the anganwadi from a rented place. In May 2018, a new anganwadi building was constructed with MGNREGA fund,‚Äù she said.

Indeed, these new buildings are swanky and spacious, with separate kitchens and tiled toilets. Many of them have attached gardens as well, and vegetables grown there are used to prepare meals for the children.

Srikanth, deputy director of the department of women and child development for Tumakuru, said, ‚ÄúWe follow a 60:40 ratio ‚Äì 60% fund is the wage component and 40% is for building materials. The wage component is [obtained] from MGNREGA and the rest ‚Ä¶ is shared with the Union ministry of women and child development and the state department.‚Äù

Thus Tumakuru alone has built 450 anganwadi centres using MGNREGA funds ‚Äì the highest in the state.

Data from the state department of women and child development suggests a large number of anganwadi centres still continue to function out of rented spaces, such as schools, community halls, etc., but the state expects to cover them under the convergence scheme in a phased manner.

But while the government has been modernising anganwadis and introducing new programmes, the workers say their demand for better pay remains unaddressed.

‚ÄúThe labour of women is never seen as labour, but viewed as a service,‚Äù Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher and a member of the ‚ÄòRight to Food‚Äô campaign in Karnataka, told The Wire. ‚ÄúThe language used in the context of their work is ‚Äòhonorarium‚Äô and not ‚Äòsalary‚Äô. This discrimination has to go and they should be treated as employees and not workers or helpers.‚Äù

Sundaramma has for the last decade been working as an anganwadi helper at Yerahalli village in H.D. Kote block, Mysuru. A short distance away, at the second anganwadi centre in Yerahalli, Nagaveni has been working as a helper for 17 years. Ask them if they‚Äôre satisfied with their salaries and they go quiet.

Gayathri, an anganwadi supervisor in H.D. Kote block, said she oversees a hundred anganwadi centres; Chandibai, a supervisor in Madhugiri block of Tumakuru, said she oversees 68 centres. The norm however is only 25 centres per supervisor.

In February 2019, anganwadi workers marched to the Parliament in Delhi to protest against the Centre‚Äôs reluctance to increase their pay and pension. In October the same year, anganwadi workers and helpers in Jharkhand protested demanding higher salaries.

In a country with such high malnutrition, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the crucial role these women play as frontline health workers. Without them and their labour, the world‚Äôs largest programme to ensure good quality early childhood care and development would flop.

27,"Job Growth Data Shows Even 5,000 Years Not Enough to Structurally Transform Indian Economy","A long-run perspective can often produce insights that remain obscured in short-run analyses. Take the problem of employment generation in India. It is accepted by many academics and analysts that India has not been able to address the problem of employment in recent years. In fact, the problem is far worse than even such well-informed, pessimistic analyses would suggest. And given that policy discussions about the Indian economy are bound to pick up around the coming budget, this long-run perspective might be of some use.

To get at the enormity of the problem, let us adopt a long-run perspective like the pioneers of development economists. Following the seminal work of one such pioneer, W. Arthur Lewis, let us conceptualise the Indian economy as consisting of two segments. The first segment comprises what we can call the ‚Äòsubsistence economy‚Äô, while the second segment forms the ‚Äòmodern, capitalist economy‚Äô.

Productivity and incomes are far higher in the modern segment than in the subsistence segment. Hence, addressing the problem of underdevelopment means transferring the labour force from the subsistence to the modern segment of the economy. Development economists refer to this process as a ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô of the economy. The problem of employment will only begin to be meaningfully addressed when the Indian economy has completed its structural transformation.

Indian employment trends

According to the World Development Indicators Database of the World Bank, in 1990, India‚Äôs labour force was 317.68 million; by 2019, it had grown to 517.49 million in 2019. Thus, over these three decades, India‚Äôs labour force grew at 1.69% per year.

What fraction of India‚Äôs labour force is in what we have called the subsistence segment? To a first approximation, we can identify the subsistence segment with those who are informally employed. These are the workers who are employed in low-productivity, low-paying, precarious work ‚Äì without job security, without social security and with minimal rights.

Watch | Interview: ‚ÄòPopulist Economic Policies Must Go, Addressing Labour Income Urgent‚Äô: Nitin Desai

There is a lot of uncertainty about the exact distribution of the labour force into formal and informal employment. Estimates of informal employment range from 93% to 85% of total employment. To get as optimistic picture as possible, let us use an estimate that is lower than all existing ones ‚Äì so let us assume that the subsistence segment in India employs 80% of the labour force.

Before developing the argument further, an important issue needs to be addressed. Even in advanced capitalist economies like the United States, a small fraction of the labour force is informally employed ‚Äì these are the precariously employed, low-wage workers. In fact, the growing use of temporary, in the the place of permanent, employees has been a characteristic of the neoliberal era since the early 1980s. Thus, advanced capitalist economies have been witnessing a rise of precarious employment.

This troubling phenomenon possibly signals a reversal of the structural transformation that advanced capitalist countries had completed in the 2.5 decades after the Second World War ‚Äì a trend that has led some economists to even characterise the US economy as a dual economy, a term that is typically reserved for underdeveloped countries.

Taking this fact into consideration, let us conceive of the completion of structural transformation not as the complete disappearance of the subsistence segment, but rather its continued existence as a small portion of the total economy. Therefore, let us assume that 10% of employment will remain informal even in an economy that has completed structural transformation.

Structural transformation in the Indian economy

Let us now pose the main question. How fast must employment grow in the modern, capitalist segment for structural transformation to be completed in a reasonable period of time?

Also read: Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea

In Table 1, I compute the annual growth rate of employment in the modern capitalist segment that would be required to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy (when only 10% of employment will be in the subsistence segment) in 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 years. I compute the ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rate under two alternative scenarios: in the first scenario, the labour force grows at the rate that we have observed it to be growing over the last three decades; in the second, decidedly unrealistic, scenario, the labour force does not grow.

What do the numbers in Table 1 say? If the labour force continues to grow at the same rate at which it is currently growing, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 4.8% per annum to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy in 50 years. If the structural transformation is to be completed in 100 years, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 3.23% per annum. If, as is extremely unlikely, the labour force stops growing from this year onwards, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 1.52% per annum to complete the structural transformation in 100 years.

To put these ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rates into perspective, we only need to ask: how fast has employment in the modern capitalist segment been growing in India over the past few decades? According to the Economic Survey of India, total employment in the private and public organised sectors of the Indian economy was 7.68 million and 19.06 million, respectively, in 1991; in 2011, the corresponding numbers were 11.42 million and 17.55 million, respectively. Thus, over the last two decades, employment in the modern segment (private + public) has grown at 0.48% per year and in the private sector of the modern segment at 2.13% per year.

Also read: Why the Wage Code is Unlikely to Improve the Conditions of Indian Workers

Returning, once again, to Table 1, we can now see the full meaning of the numbers: if the labour force and employment in the modern capitalist segment in India continues to grow at the currently observed long run rates of 1.69% and 0.48%, respectively, then the Indian economy will be unable to complete its structural transformation even in 5,000 years. If the labour force grows at the observed rate of 1.69% per year, and the modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for the private capitalist sector, i.e. 2.13% per year, then the Indian economy will complete its structural transformation in 357 years.

If the labour force stops growing altogether while the aggregate modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for only the private capitalist sector, i.e. at 2.13% per year, both of which are extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future, even then Indian structural transformation will be completed in 72 years.

These absurdly large numbers should go some way in opening the eyes of those who have been all fired up by India‚Äôs economic performance in the past three decades. In substantive terms, these numbers convey the simple fact that without radical changes in policy orientation and the institutional setup, economic problems relating to the vast majority of the working population in India is here to stay for a long, long time.

Expectations were high, especially from the July budget, on taking urgent steps to address the alarming slide in economic growth. However, the document proved to be a self-destructing exercise. Several key decisions announced were either scaled back, watered down or just couldn‚Äôt get going.

But the burning question remains, for a country with a sizeable young population more than 600 million: What do the youth want from the Budget? And the answer is simple. Nothing. The youth want and need jobs.

An estimated 5 million people graduate out of college every year. More often than not, these young adults have neither a strong academic base, nor any special skills that make them immediately employable. So, armed with what should be a strong educational qualification, many are confined to jobs that are low on skill but offer the comfort of a fixed salary.

What is new and unnerving now is the overwhelming numbers of young people looking for employment on account of the changing demographics of the country. CMIE‚Äôs data indicates that in a state like Uttar Pradesh for instance, unemployment doubled from 5.91% in 2018 to 9.95% in 2019. Countrywide, graduates face a 17% unemployment rate.

There‚Äôs another, grimmer side to the story. Those who claim the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests are a one-off instance of youth activism are getting the signs completely wrong. While the context of the protests may be different, this outpouring is a culmination of issues, not a standalone event.

It started with vehement protests against fee hikes in JNU and other places. JNU has been protesting a 300% fee hike. Earlier in November, IIT Bombay and IIT-BHU protested against a 900% fee hike. Similar stories emerged from FTII and IIMC.

A direct rub-off

Many have criticised what they see as an entitled attitude by these young students. What may actually be taking place is a direct rub-off of the stories these aspiring job seekers saw and heard from their homes and towns.

As per the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, the average monthly spending by an individual fell to Rs 1,446 in 2017-18 from Rs 1,501 in 2011-12, down 3.7%. It‚Äôs worse when you slice that for the rural-urban split. A Nomura report points out that rural households saw wage growth slip to a four-quarter low of 4% in 2019.

In a situation where households struggle to find enough to pay for basic supplies, education ‚Äì and the fees required to get it ‚Äì becomes both unattainable and unimportant.

The embers of student protest have become a full-fledged fire, as young students facing the possibility of low to no jobs find that their government wasn‚Äôt even paying lip service to the need for creating employment opportunities but instead were raising a completely different and to many, irrelevant issue.

Another standard deflection tool

In her maiden budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that the government is enabling millions to take up industry-relevant skill training and boosting their job prospects via the ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô initiative.

Here‚Äôs what the numbers say. An analysis of the unit-level data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 shows only a small section of the youth reported receiving any vocational training. Nationally, only 1.8% of the population reported receiving formal vocational or technical training, while 5.6% reported receiving informal vocational training like self-learning. This means 93% of the population received no training, from either formal or informal sources.

Bear in mind, the youth comprised more than half of the people who received formal vocational or technical training.

The data also shows that a large share of them were either unemployed or out of the labour force. Ironically, 42% of the youth who did receive any formal technical training were not part of the labour force at all. And it goes without saying, across age groups, substantial shares of women who received such training were out of the labour force. The training itself was starkly different for men and women.

No skilling, no jobs and not enough disposable income to access either private skilling or education. India‚Äôs youth are angry. And now they are impatient.

So, while the Budget may be held up to question on many parameters ‚Äî fiscal health, poor revenues and kickstarting manufacturing ‚Äî for me the barometer is this: At the start of this decade, India needed 100 million jobs to meet its employment demands. As we step into 2020, India is facing the worst unemployment rate in over four decades. India‚Äôs youth want jobs. They want and deserve to feel secure about their living environment, about their educational institutes and about their economic prospects. Not another Budget speech."
29,India‚Äôs Politics and Economics Reflect a Simmering Crisis of Confidence and Mistrust,"The last few weeks have caused a few ripples in India‚Äôs political and economic landscape, reflecting the various shades of problems that our governance system is currently facing.

From the economic point of view, the government, acknowledging a state of crisis, announced yet another set of sector-specific measures. This time it was a Rs 10,000 crore relief package in the form of a ‚Äòspecial window fund‚Äô to revive India‚Äôs real estate industry, one of the worst affected sectors by the current slowdown.

There is little doubt that the real estate sector, which was once responsible for creating a massive number of jobs, is now witnessing an enduring liquidity-crunch. Some of this is likely due to the shock delivered by demonetisation. Nevertheless, the liquidity crunch has seriously impacted job creation in the construction sector, especially in the segments of residential and affordable housing.

The real estate‚Äôs poor performance over the past few years has also added to the deteriorating asset quality of India‚Äôs NBFCs, which has exacerbated the NPA problem. At the same time, due to a fall in demand for mid-income and affordable housing, credit demand for loans by property investors also dropped, resulting in a twin balance sheet problem for the banks.

A worsening bank crisis, evident in the collapse of IL&FS and PMC, has to some extent sparked fear amongst people who occupy the low and middle-income categories. This, in turn, brings down deposit holdings and limits the banking system‚Äôs credit creation powers.

With banks affected by a crisis of confidence, a problem that will involve some recovery time, it remains unclear how effective a supply-side measure like a special window fund can do to revive the real estate sector completely on its own. Especially considering this special measure is, by one estimate, likely to help less than 10% of the country‚Äôs stalled real estate projects. A wholesome, full-time solution requires a more constant credit-channel from India‚Äôs banks.

On the political side, in Maharashtra, we are seeing the Shiv Sena-BJP pre-poll alliance in almost on the verge of collapse. While the former was exploring an alternative political combination i.e. with NCP and Congress, to form a state government, president‚Äôs rule was imposed in the state. In Haryana too, the BJP‚Äôs vote share, to its own surprise, significantly declined due to the lacklustre economic conditions ‚Äì massive job loss and agrarian distress ‚Äì in the state.

The Ayodhya judgment

Amidst all these scenarios came the long overdue Ayodhya judgment by the Supreme Court which settled the 2.77 acre disputed land title case in favor of Ram Lalla and the Hindus to construct a temple there, while granting Muslims a 5 acre land allocated by the UP government for a mosque to be constructed elsewhere.

The judgment, even though decided and announced by India‚Äôs Supreme Court, needs to be viewed as a major ‚Äòpolitical event‚Äô that is principally aligned with the current ruling party‚Äôs vision to have a Ram temple constructed in Ayodhya at all costs. For Hindu fundamentalists, the judgment brings an actualisation of a major historical struggle for establishing religious precedence. It is hard not to see this in the larger context of the apex court announcing this at a time when its own credibility remains in serious doubt (we still haven‚Äôt had one hearing on the constitutionality of the Indian government‚Äôs action in Kashmir).

Also Read: Maharashtra Slips into President‚Äôs Rule Even with Hours Left of NCP‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeadline‚Äô

For now, in terms of its outlined manifesto goals, the BJP has so far emerged successful in achieving two of its three vital national objectives: the dilution of Article 370; having a Ram temple constructed at the disputed site in Ayodhya, with the third goal now, of creating a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), left to fulfil.

In the international scenario, India‚Äôs trade negotiations cohort (led by the prime minister himself), in an eleventh-hour decision, pulled out of joining the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), citing its discontent with the nature of underlying trade agreement that failed to accommodate India‚Äôs principal concerns. This move was observed as a surprise by many commentators, considering how the minister of commerce and other members of the trade negotiators expressed a strong desire for India to be part of the plurilateral trade forum in the months leading up to the official meet in Bangkok.

A common underlying link

But, what seems to be a common underlying link emerging across some of these political and economic events in India‚Äôs recent past?

On a certain level, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta pointed recently, despite ‚Äúthe pantomime optimism‚Äù that the government and the media are trying to display, it is gradually ‚Äúbecoming impossible to disguise the sense of gloom surrounding the Indian economy‚Äù. The growth numbers and estimates at this point reflect exercises of statistical-fudging that mislead facts and fail to represent or forecast an authentic picture for India‚Äôs growth trajectory.

The connecting link, on a deeper level, points towards the fact that we are at a crossroads as with regard to the Indian government‚Äôs ability to lead the nation towards a progressive economic future. The political economic landscape, especially in the last five to six years has institutionalised this crisis of ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô where institutional credibility remains seriously doubted, whether of the RBI or the Supreme Court, as each action seems aligned with the propagandist agenda of the state or guided entirely by political goals rather than democratic or market principles.

A state election (like in Maharashtra) happens with two parties clearly declaring a pre-poll alliance but then parting ways right after the election. This event, of course, isn‚Äôt new in the history of Indian politics. Parties do break up after an election cycle. However, a culture of political inconsistency combined with normalisation of eroding voter-faith is almost becoming a norm, which will have serious impediments on how people vote (or don‚Äôt vote) in elections down the road.

On a larger international plank too, India‚Äôs own position and foreign image, as Ram Guha recently argued, has significantly been damaged post-New Delhi‚Äôs act to downgrade Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs status into two Union Territories and read down Article 370. This damage can be assessed in terms of India‚Äôs weakening democratic credentials ‚Äì a point echoed across US Congressional meetings, its presidential election announcements and in the foreign press.

The last-minute decision to pull out of the RCEP too doesn‚Äôt augur well with India‚Äôs diplomatic and economic policy push towards an Act East outlook. And, without a suitable alternative, this decision warrants a closer assessment in terms of India‚Äôs weakening trade competitiveness levels and diplomatic ability to negotiate agreements based on mutually beneficial market principles (after all this trade negotiation process was on for almost six years).

A crisis of confidence

In the context of the domestic economy too, a crisis of confidence is clear by observing levels of business and investor confidence. In fact, a recent data point indicates how there has been an increase in outward foreign direct investment levels from the private sector at a time when domestic demand remains dismally low along with the consumption demand. A higher outward FDI level in a weak domestic demand scenario simply indicates that the private sector players trust their investment abroad more than they do within India.

There is substantial economic evidence that argues how an atmosphere of systemic mistrust combined with a lack of confidence can adversely impact an economy‚Äôs growth rates by negatively impacting investment levels and business cycles. The logic is simple, as echoed by the Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, who argues: ‚ÄúAn atmosphere generated by a steady flow and variety of lies is like a dark cloud over the facts. Businesses can‚Äôt plan effectively when they don‚Äôt know who or what can be trusted.‚Äù

Also Read: #RightSideUp: Ayodhya, Judgment Day

Mistrust in political functioning or leadership isn‚Äôt only affecting India but even countries like the US. In a recent article for the New York Times, Shiller explains how conditions of a persistent threat to American press amalgamated with the political dangers surfacing from a culture of lying under President Donald Trump, who feels free to attack all press against him as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.

In India‚Äôs political landscape, a deep social polarisation on political action or events is a mirror reflection of this phenomenon. Being on the receiving side on this, I have personally observed a clear pattern of this, emerging from the ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù labelling of anyone with contrarian views or opinions to state-policy. This was even more explicit with all the chatter created right after New Delhi‚Äôs action on Kashmir. Some of the reactions on social media platform presented deeply troubling and resentful views not only against the Kashmiris but against anyone who advocated for the rights of Kashmiris.

Entrenched mistrust

Mistrust is further entrenched in society (and normalised) when the leadership promotes it. An illustration would be to recollect the demonetisation speech by the PM in November of 2016, and how right after, in another speech he passionately remarked: ‚ÄúI have asked the country for just 50 days. If after December 30, there are shortcomings in my work or there are mistakes or a bad intention found in my work, I will be prepared for the punishment that the country decides for me.‚Äù With the shock-move clearly failing and choking India‚Äôs growth engine, there hasn‚Äôt been any apology or official word on this since then.

At the same time, a form of violent verbal attitude ‚Äì shaped by a rhetorical axis of ‚Äòfor or against‚Äô, ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô ‚Äì is seen dividing a citizenry on key social, economic and political issues that have ramifications for the nation as a whole. And this has serious consequences for India‚Äôs own future and its credentials as a large democratic, market economy. It was ‚Äòtrust‚Äô in these very credentials which provided greater clarity and consistency to business communities ‚Äì within and outside India, to invest in India‚Äôs market (as do so in a severely authoritarian regime like China).

Watch | The Wire Business Report | India‚Äôs Job Crisis: Behind the Numbers with Mahesh Vyas

Trust and confidence are factors that are extremely difficult to measure or quantify. They have a social multiplier effect that drives an entire citizenry to work towards collective progress or regress. One needs to closely study and understand this effect: how a rise in mistrust or lack of confidence levels which is multiplying as a social phenomenon across countries like India, the US (to name a few) is affecting the citizenry at large?

There are deeper questions involved here about the political and economic psyche of an average citizen and how vulnerable she can be made when a strong state, as a matter of policy or law, pursues a polarising political agenda.

At the same time, from purely an economic lens, a fragile confidence in a political system will cause economic growth to fall. This is something that we perhaps are already seeing in India.

30,"9 Million Jobs Lost in 6 Years, a First in Indian History","New Delhi: A recent working paper published by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University has contested official claims on employment, showing an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù fall in total employment from 2011-12 to 2017-18.

Written by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K. Parida, the study says employment dropped by 9 million between these years ‚Äì ‚Äúfor the first time in India‚Äôs history‚Äù.

While these are not new observations, this is perhaps the first such formal study to establish through official data that total employment is declining and a reserve army of unemployed youth (both openly unemployed and disheartened) is rising ‚Äúmassively‚Äù. The study also shows a trend of increasing contractualisation in the both government and private jobs.

Also read: Troubling Unemployment Data, Leaked in January, Now Released Post-Elections

Though the share of regular and formal employment increased marginally overall, most jobs are still being generated by micro and small units of the unorganised and private sectors (68% of the total non-farm employment during 2017-18), the study found. The share of informal jobs has increased in the public sector as well, indicating a lack of decent government jobs.

Sector-wise decline

The agricultural sector registered a decline in employment at the rate of 4.5 million per annum (about 27 million in total) during 2011-12 and 2017-18. The share of employment in the agricultural and allied sector declined from 49 to about 44%.

The labour-intensive manufacturing sector registered a decline of 3.5 million jobs. The share of manufacturing in total employment has thus gone down from 12.6 to 12.1% ‚Äì in fact, manufacturing jobs have fallen for the first time in India‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs not just a decline in growth rate but in absolute numbers too.

The authors note that, ‚Äúfalling manufacturing jobs is the opposite of the goal of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, and the opposite of what is desirable if the process of structural transformation is to be sustained‚Äù.

There‚Äôs a slowdown in construction job growth. Non-manufacturing jobs (mostly construction) which created about 4 million jobs every year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 created only about 0.6 million per annum during 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Also read: NSSO Data Puts Unemployment at 45-Year High in 2017-18: Report

The only sector to witness sustained job growth (3 million per annum) was services. There has been a 17.3 million rise in regular salaried workers in this sector during 2011-12 and 2017-18. However, the quality of jobs in this sector are mostly poor.

The study says:

‚ÄúWhile falling total and youth employment in agriculture is good news from the structural transformation point of view, falling manufacturing employment and decelerating construction employment growth are bad news for the economy, which moved up to lower middle income status just over a decade ago. To sustain the growth of income, improve standard of living, and to reduce poverty, employment opportunities in manufacturing and construction (although a transitory sector) is necessary. Because this would not only sustain the structural transformation process, it would also help sustain growth of GDP over the long run.‚Äù

Speaking to The Wire, Mehrotra said that the number of entrants into the labour force has been increasing since 2011-12, it was very small between 2004-05 and 2011-12 (only 2 million per annum). The number has risen after that in the last six years to roughly 5 million per annum. At the same time, non-agricultural job growth has declined. When these facts are combined, it indicates that there is an increase in the open unemployment rate. The supply of labour is increasing while the demand for it is decreasing.

According to The Indian Express, this result is ‚Äúin stark contrast to the recent study by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey, which was commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister‚Äù. This study had claimed that total employment grew from 433 million in 2011-12 to 457 million in 2017-18.

The latest study by Mehrotra and Parida, however, says that employment fell from 474 million in 2011-12 to 465 million in 2017-18.

A major reason for this difference could be because the estimates for 2004-05 and 2011-12 in the study by Bhandari and Dubey (412 million and 433 million respectively) are much lower than that in Mehrotra and Parida (459 and 474). Mehrotra believes that it‚Äôs almost certainly because they have used only Usual Principal Status (UPS) and not Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS) in their calculations.

Under UPS, a person is considered part of the labour force if s/he works for 183 days or more in a year. Under UPSS, a person who has worked even for 30 days in a year is considered employed.

Also read: The Slowdown is Real and We Need More than Brave Faces and Silly Alibis to Fix Things

However, for the 2017-18 figure, both the studies seem to have used both principal and subsidiary status as the results are very close (457 and 465 respectively).

Real wages, which were increasing from 2004-05 to 2011-12 because of job growth (Mehrotra says 7.5 million new non-agricultural jobs were being created at a time when fewer people were entering the labour force), have stagnated or fell. ‚ÄúWe have gone back to the period of 1996-2004 in terms of real wages, they‚Äôre flat or they‚Äôve fallen,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Though the study only draws inferences from the study as the final conclusion can only be arrived at when the consumer expenditure survey is out. The authors‚Äô inference is that poverty has not declined in the last six years.

Even though the latest official consumption survey is not out yet, Himanshu, associate professor at JNU‚Äôs Centre for Economic Studies and Planning compared two Periodic Labour Force Surveys in 2014-15 and 2017-18 and found that the consumption expenditure of rural and urban Indian households has been falling. ‚ÄúWe know from macro data that private consumption as a proportion of the GDP has actually fallen in the last 6 years, and household savings have fallen very sharply. When you put that together, it is very clear that stagnation in real wages is showing up in declining expenditure and a fall in household savings,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Also read: Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking

The study also shows that there has been some improvement in the share of informal workers in the total workforce ‚Äì it has gone down from 93% to 90.7%. Informal workers are defined as those who have no death and disability insurance and old age pension. The reasons for his decline could be due to factors like the government paying the workers‚Äô share of EPFO contributions for three years and increase in registration of firms due under GST (which could have encouraged EPFO registration as well).

Within the organised sector, however, there is an interesting paradox ‚Äì the share of those who have social security has increased in the organised sector, reversing an erstwhile trend, but the number of workers with short term contracts has also gone up.

In conclusion, the authors suggest a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy ‚Äúto address agrarian transformation, boost real wages in rural areas, ensure industrial development, taking skill issues into consideration‚Äù."
31,"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

Also read: ‚ÄòHow Can Centre Reopen 50,000 Temples in Valley, When There Are Only 4,000 in J&K?‚Äô

He added that after assurances from the DC Srinagar, they have submitted proposals to him for helping the company get new clients. ‚ÄúWe are very hopeful that we will get business for the company. I am personally working with Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and we are discussing how to solve this issue. So far we have conducted several meetings with him in the presence of other officials. We are hopeful that we will get more business, so that no one will lose their jobs.‚Äù

According to Nissar, when they started this unit, the site‚Äôs infrastructure and setup was poor. They have changed that over the years and now business was doing well. ‚ÄúThis office is like my child. I have a very personal attachment to it and in all these years, we all have worked so hard that I cannot see it in this phase.‚Äù

However, employees working with the company are not seeing anything happen. ‚ÄúWe have been waiting for weeks. Like many promises from the government, we don‚Äôt think this will come true for us,‚Äù said an employee who was standing at the AEGIS gate to meet his colleague.

The ongoing clampdown has hit businesses across sectors. Tourism, which is considered to be the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs economy, is going through its one of its worst phases yet.

Finding no income in the last 64 days, hotel and houseboat owners have laid off their staffers. There are more than 1,200 houseboats registered in Srinagar, and each houseboat had two helpers. Now, 90% of the workers on these houseboats have lost their jobs.

‚ÄúI used to work on the HB Fairy houseboat. With no work left there, my employer told me to go home. I have small children back at home and it is becoming difficult for me to feed them. Yanhan gunda gardi chalti hai, jo mann main aata hai, karte hain. Bhugta kaun hai, hum jaise gareeb (There is authoritarianism here. Whatever they want for themselves, they do that. It is the poor people like me who become victims of such decisions),‚Äù said 33-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Bhat from Srinagar‚Äôs Buchwara, on the Dal Lake.

The most common worry is how to manage daily expenses. A worker standing next to Bhat said, ‚ÄúDo they have any idea of the problems facing a common man here? No. If that would have been the case, they would not have chosen this. We have families, small children. I don‚Äôt have money even to buy diapers for my son.‚Äù

Unofficial lay offs

People like Bhat and Tariq know that their jobs are gone, and have very little hope of getting them back. But others, who work for private firms, are still unsure of what the future holds for them. Employees of one of the most renowned private automobile outlets, Jamkash Vehicles which deals in Maruti cars, are now feeling the heat. The dealership has 1,400 employees in six different outlets across the Valley.

Employees‚Äô attendance has not been maintained for the last month in Jamkash Vehicles‚Äô main branch in Hyderpora, Srinagar. ‚ÄúThere are chances that they will reduce nearly 50% of their staff if the situation does not improve. Although they have not given us any official notification, it is certain,‚Äù said a senior employee, wishing not to be named.

Having worked for the company for more than 14 years, he told The Wire that if the company does, it is only the workers who will be in trouble. ‚ÄúThere is huge unemployment here and when normalcy returns, the company will hire new workers. It is not a big deal for them. Their main concern is business ‚Äì if you are providing them that, you are safe. If you failed to do it, you will be shown the door.‚Äù

According to an employee working with Rising Kashmir, a Srinagar-based daily, the newspaper has also laid off staff members. ‚ÄúRabiya Bashir, Ishfaq Amin, Sahil Iqbal and Ishfaq Ahmad were told to stop work. Facing a financial crisis in this continuous clampdown, the organisation was not able to pay them. It‚Äôs a sad decision but what are the options? I am feeling bad for them.‚Äù

A journalist at Greater Kashmir, wishing not to be named, told The Wire that they have been told by the HR that the organisation has decided on a new policy for its employees: ‚ÄúNo work, no pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, since this is communication blockade, many district reporters were not able to send their stories. This decision has mostly hit district reporters who are working on meagre salaries,‚Äù he said.

With no improvement in the circumstances in sight, many weekly news magazines and online portals in the Valley are facing tremendous losses on a daily basis.

32,"On Manmohan Singh's Birthday, Congress Renews Unemployment Charge Against BJP Govt","New Delhi: The Congress on Thursday harnessed the occasion of former prime minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs birthday to highlight rising unemployment and falling education levels in India.

Since morning, the party‚Äôs social media handles were rife with multiple tributes to Singh. Its national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, meanwhile, addressed the press to present the recently-released economic and higher education indicators that would reportedly substantiate the claim that the BJP-led Union government has left the country in a poor state.

Surjewala quoted figures from two reports: the 8th Annual All India Survey on Higher Education, 2018-19 released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), and the Unemployment in India: A Statistical Profile released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

Unemployment

The Congress leader said that at 8.19% in August, 2019, the unemployment rate in India in perhaps the highest since Independence. The August figure shows further deterioration from 7.03% in May 2019, which it was itself the highest in the last 50 years.

Surjewala also pointed out that the figures are much higher than the global average of 4.95% declared by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

The current global average unemployment rate is 4.95% & as per the latest CMIE report India‚Äôs unemployment rate is nearly double that amount at 7.46%. And the BJP govt. still claims we‚Äôre the fast growing economy in the world. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/JWK3pl0lM5 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

He also pointed out at the gender break up of the problem. ‚ÄúWhile the unemployment rate among men is 6%, it is 17.5% among women. This is the reality of the union government‚Äôs Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao mission.‚Äù

The rate of unemployment for men is 6.1% while that among women is more than double i.e. 17.5%. This is the reality of the ‚ÄòBeti Bachao Beti Padhao‚Äô Govt: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/Vd2FCdHkL6 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Both rural & urban unemployment have risen in the last four months but in all the ‚Äúbudgets‚Äù presented our FM @nsitharaman there is no policy to address the growing unemployment crisis. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/XH6PJ0oXrk ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Another staggering conclusion the CMIE report highlights, Surjewala said, is that the current unemployment rate is almost three times higher than the global average among those who are graduates or more. Almost 15% of those highly-educated people who are actively looking for a job are unable to find one.

‚ÄúThe report says that more than one young people are without a job now. In reality, however, the number may be much more,‚Äù said the Congress leader.

Unemployment level jumps to 15% among those who are graduates and above. This is three times the international average. Currently more than one crore youth are unemployed: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/70hbYS3kg8 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019



Education

The MHRD report, the Congress leader said, throws up even more troubling statistics.

‚ÄúThe government in its own report admits that 74% among the youth, between 18 and 23 years, are not enrolled in colleges at the moment.

‚ÄúOnly 2.5% colleges in India are admitting students in PhD programmes. As many as 35% of the total colleges have only one single programme. And to top it all, 83% of the total number of colleges in India are privately managed. What has happened to the responsibility of the government which claimed to provide world-class education to all?‚Äù Surjewala asked.

He added that only 8.5% of the total number of teachers are from Scheduled Caste communities, which means that even the minimum guaranteed reservation system is not being implemented properly.

‚ÄúBJP and the present government has turned India‚Äôs demographic dividend into a demographic disaster because of their disastrous policies. A government that continues to say ‚Äòeverything is fine‚Äô should think a little more,‚Äù he said, adding that it is ‚Äútime for the prime minister to look beyond stage-managed programmes.‚Äù

He said that the prime minister should now start addressing the most pertinent question the youth of India is asking, that is ‚ÄúHowdy, Education, Howdy, Unemployment‚Äù.

He also said that in the 10 years the UPA was in the government, the unemployment rate had never shot up like this.

Earlier in the day, Congress took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While posting a video on Manmohan Singh, it described him as ‚Äúthe leader other leaders love‚Äù.

Sonia Gandhi, the party‚Äôs interim president, also wished the former prime minister on his birthday, recalled his contributions, and said, ‚ÄúPresent day rulers across the spectrum have much to learn from his innate wisdom.‚Äù"
33,North India's Unemployment Woes Due to Lack of Qualified Candidates: Labour Minister,"New Delhi: Union labour minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar stirred controversy on Sunday after indicating that the employment crisis in North Indian states was not due to a lack of jobs, but that recruiting companies could not find enough qualified candidates.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments attracted criticism from opposition politicians but also shine an unflattering spotlight on the Skill India project, a massive initiative that comes under the skill development ministry and works closely with the labour ministry.

Over the past four years, both supporters and critics of the Centre have pointed out flaws in the flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), which was supposed to align the capabilities of India‚Äôs youth to the requirements of India Inc.

‚ÄúThe issue of employment keep figuring in newspapers these days. I am handling the same ministry for labour and employment and examine the issue daily. I have understood the problem,‚Äù Gangwar told reporters on Saturday in Bareilly, his Lok Sabha constituency.

‚ÄúRecruiters who visit north India complain of facing dearth of quality people for the posts they need to fill,‚Äù he added.

According to the latest India Skill Report (2019), which is backed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), only a little over of 45% of youth graduating from educational institutions are employable.

Earlier this year, data released by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) also indicated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate may have been the highest in over 40 years at 6.1% in 2017-18.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments, therefore, come as salt in the wound for a festering problem. In October 2018, The Wire had reported of top level exits at the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a problem that indicated not all is well with Skill India.

The minister‚Äôs remarks drew sharp reactions from opposition with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra saying the government was trying to escape blame for the job losses due to economic slowdown by such ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù comments.

‚ÄúMr Minister, it has been more than five years for your government. There is no job creation. Whatever jobs were there, they have been snatched due to the economic slowdown brought by the government. You want to escape by insulting North Indians,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYouths are looking towards the government hoping that it will do something good for them,‚Äù the Congress general secretary said.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said such comments are laughable.

‚ÄúAfter the different laughable statements by different Union ministers on the serious issue of economic slowdown, instead of removing unemployment in the country now it is being said that there is no shortage of jobs, but of competence, especially amongst north Indians.

‚ÄúThis is extremely shameful and an apology should be tendered to the nation,‚Äù she tweeted.

Clarification?

In an apparent clarification made to news agency ANI, Gangwar, who is a minister of state with independent charge, said that he was trying to paint a different context.

There was a lack of skill and the government has opened a skill ministry so children can be trained as per the job requirement, he said.

34,"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

Also read: ‚ÄòHow Can Centre Reopen 50,000 Temples in Valley, When There Are Only 4,000 in J&K?‚Äô

He added that after assurances from the DC Srinagar, they have submitted proposals to him for helping the company get new clients. ‚ÄúWe are very hopeful that we will get business for the company. I am personally working with Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and we are discussing how to solve this issue. So far we have conducted several meetings with him in the presence of other officials. We are hopeful that we will get more business, so that no one will lose their jobs.‚Äù

According to Nissar, when they started this unit, the site‚Äôs infrastructure and setup was poor. They have changed that over the years and now business was doing well. ‚ÄúThis office is like my child. I have a very personal attachment to it and in all these years, we all have worked so hard that I cannot see it in this phase.‚Äù

However, employees working with the company are not seeing anything happen. ‚ÄúWe have been waiting for weeks. Like many promises from the government, we don‚Äôt think this will come true for us,‚Äù said an employee who was standing at the AEGIS gate to meet his colleague.

The ongoing clampdown has hit businesses across sectors. Tourism, which is considered to be the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs economy, is going through its one of its worst phases yet.

Finding no income in the last 64 days, hotel and houseboat owners have laid off their staffers. There are more than 1,200 houseboats registered in Srinagar, and each houseboat had two helpers. Now, 90% of the workers on these houseboats have lost their jobs.

‚ÄúI used to work on the HB Fairy houseboat. With no work left there, my employer told me to go home. I have small children back at home and it is becoming difficult for me to feed them. Yanhan gunda gardi chalti hai, jo mann main aata hai, karte hain. Bhugta kaun hai, hum jaise gareeb (There is authoritarianism here. Whatever they want for themselves, they do that. It is the poor people like me who become victims of such decisions),‚Äù said 33-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Bhat from Srinagar‚Äôs Buchwara, on the Dal Lake.

The most common worry is how to manage daily expenses. A worker standing next to Bhat said, ‚ÄúDo they have any idea of the problems facing a common man here? No. If that would have been the case, they would not have chosen this. We have families, small children. I don‚Äôt have money even to buy diapers for my son.‚Äù

Unofficial lay offs

People like Bhat and Tariq know that their jobs are gone, and have very little hope of getting them back. But others, who work for private firms, are still unsure of what the future holds for them. Employees of one of the most renowned private automobile outlets, Jamkash Vehicles which deals in Maruti cars, are now feeling the heat. The dealership has 1,400 employees in six different outlets across the Valley.

Employees‚Äô attendance has not been maintained for the last month in Jamkash Vehicles‚Äô main branch in Hyderpora, Srinagar. ‚ÄúThere are chances that they will reduce nearly 50% of their staff if the situation does not improve. Although they have not given us any official notification, it is certain,‚Äù said a senior employee, wishing not to be named.

Having worked for the company for more than 14 years, he told The Wire that if the company does, it is only the workers who will be in trouble. ‚ÄúThere is huge unemployment here and when normalcy returns, the company will hire new workers. It is not a big deal for them. Their main concern is business ‚Äì if you are providing them that, you are safe. If you failed to do it, you will be shown the door.‚Äù

According to an employee working with Rising Kashmir, a Srinagar-based daily, the newspaper has also laid off staff members. ‚ÄúRabiya Bashir, Ishfaq Amin, Sahil Iqbal and Ishfaq Ahmad were told to stop work. Facing a financial crisis in this continuous clampdown, the organisation was not able to pay them. It‚Äôs a sad decision but what are the options? I am feeling bad for them.‚Äù

A journalist at Greater Kashmir, wishing not to be named, told The Wire that they have been told by the HR that the organisation has decided on a new policy for its employees: ‚ÄúNo work, no pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, since this is communication blockade, many district reporters were not able to send their stories. This decision has mostly hit district reporters who are working on meagre salaries,‚Äù he said.

With no improvement in the circumstances in sight, many weekly news magazines and online portals in the Valley are facing tremendous losses on a daily basis. An owner of the online news portal, requesting anonymity, told The Wire, ‚ÄúSince August 5, we are not able to publish a single story.

35,Congress Leaders Amp Pressure on Govt Over Economy,"New Delhi: Congress on Saturday attacked the BJP government over the slump in the GDP, with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanding that the Centre clarify who is responsible for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù the economy.

Priyanka on Twitter said the government that trumpeted of bringing achche din (‚Äògood days‚Äô) has now ‚Äúpunctured‚Äù the economy.

‚ÄúThe GDP growth rate clearly shows that the government trumpeting about ‚Äòachche din‚Äô has punctured the state of the economy. Neither is GDP growth high nor is the rupee strong and jobs are being lost. Now clarify as to whose action has destroyed the economy,‚Äù she said in a tweet in Hindi.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growth to over six-year low of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2019-20, according to official data released on Friday.

36,"What Explains India's Shadow Banking Crisis, and What Can Be Done Now?","The ongoing liquidity crisis in India‚Äôs shadow banking sector is intensifying. The troubles that started with defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) last year are far from over, as the sector continues to face a severe liquidity crisis. If tight liquidity conditions persist in the next financial year, it may turn into a solvency issue for several shadow banks.

After the IL&FS collapse, the entire sector is facing a crisis of confidence. Investors are shying away from investing in securities issued by shadow banks. Several shadow banks are finding it difficult to raise money from banks, mutual funds and the rest of the financial system for either funding their growth or rollover of existing short-term debt. Some are resorting to asset monetisation to meet their immediate repayment obligations.

Leave aside those shadow banks that have weak financial profiles; even financially sound and better-governed entities are facing a liquidity squeeze. Most shadow banks have reduced disbursement of loans to preserve liquidity.

After growing aggressively in the last three years, the credit disbursals by shadow banks have fallen by almost a third this year. Consequently, lending to housing, automobile, consumer durables and small businesses has substantially reduced. In sectors such as housing and automobile, shadow banks play a vital role in loan financing. The reduced availability of funding has contributed to the slowdown in these sectors.

Also read: How a Shadow Banking Crisis Sent India‚Äôs Autos Sector Into a Tailspin

In particular, the automobile sector has been badly hit by the ongoing liquidity crisis as shadow banks were the leading financiers of commercial vehicles, passenger cars and two-wheelers in India. Before the onset of the liquidity crisis, close to 40% of new auto loans were issued by shadow banks. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, passenger car sales declined by 26% in April-July 2019 over the same period last year. Close to 300 dealer showrooms of passenger vehicles have shut down across India in the last one year as shadow banks have stopped financing vehicle purchase, while automakers have either cut production or shut production plants temporarily to keep inventory in check. Analysts estimate that tens of thousands of jobs in India‚Äôs auto sector are at risk if the slump in the automobile sector continues.

Since commercial banks are still struggling with high levels of non-performing assets, they are not rushing in to fill the void left by the shadow banks. Rather, commercial banks may also like to reduce their exposure to stressed sectors such as automobile and housing to improve their balance sheets. All these developments in the financial sector will have serious ramifications on the overall economy as the bulk of India‚Äôs economic growth is driven by domestic demand.

DHFL: The new poster boy of the liquidity crisis

Since September 2018, hardly a week passes without more bad news about the cash-strapped Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). On August 16, DHFL again defaulted on its repayment obligations worth Rs 15.7 billion on non-convertible debentures and commercial papers. Nothing new as the company has not been able to meet most of its debt repayment obligations since June 2019, but this was the largest default by the DHFL till date.

DHFL has a total debt liability of Rs 850 billion as of June 2019, out of which secured loans stood at Rs 749 billion while the rest is unsecured. The company posted a net loss of Rs 22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018-2019.

The company‚Äôs lending business has virtually come to a standstill, with no fresh disbursements of loans in the last six months. The series of defaults have made it almost impossible for the company to raise new money from the financial markets.

In July, while announcing the fourth-quarter financial results, the company admitted that it is ‚Äúundergoing substantial financial stress‚Äù and its ability to raise funds was ‚Äúsubstantially impaired and the business has been brought to a standstill with there being minimal/virtually no disbursements‚Ä¶ These developments may raise a significant doubt on the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.‚Äù

Also read: How Should India Resolve the Fault Lines in its Shadow Banking System?

Of late, DHFL sold its stake in non-core businesses to meet some of its repayment obligations, but it has not been able to find suitable buyers for a majority equity stake in the company. So far, investors have only shown interest in buying portions of its asset portfolio.

Earlier this month, the company approached the consortium of lenders with a resolution plan that includes conversion of debt to equity, a moratorium on repayments, and new credit lines to start fresh lending. The bankers are now discussing the resolution plan. Currently, the Wadhawan family controls DHFL, with a 39.21% stake in the company. If the lenders accept the resolution plan, they may also demand to replace the company‚Äôs management because in January, online news portal CobraPost raised allegations that DHFL created shell companies to divert funds worth Rs 31 billion.

After the IL&FS collapse, DHFL is the second large-sized shadow bank on the verge of bankruptcy. With so much public money at stake, banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies are all keen to avoid bankruptcy at DHFL.

A belated regulatory response

In the past two months, several regulatory measures have been announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India. Some of the regulatory measures were long overdue. For instance, returning the regulatory authority over the housing finance sector from National Housing Bank to the RBI is a welcome move, provided the staff strength of RBI is suitably increased to undertake both onsite inspections and off-site surveillance of housing finance companies that constitute a major segment of India‚Äôs shadow banking sector.

Another notable development is that the RBI is now empowered to remove any director and supersede the board of directors of shadow banks ‚Äúin the public interest or to prevent the affairs of a nonbanking financial company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors or creditors, or financial stability or for securing the proper management of such company.‚Äù

Besides, the RBI has been given powers to remove or debar auditors if they fail to conduct their role correctly. The financial penalties are also enhanced if the shadow banks don‚Äôt implement the regulatory measures.

The RBI has recently cancelled registrations of 1,851 shadow banks that could not raise even Rs 20 million to meet the minimum regulatory requirements. One wonders why such entities were permitted to run a shadow bank in the first place?

What about carrots?

Both the finance ministry and the RBI have announced several policy measures to ease liquidity pressure in the shadow banking sector. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen. These include an increase in any bank‚Äôs single-exposure limit to a single shadow bank from the existing 15% to 20% of tier-1 capital; priority sector lending status for credit to shadow banks for on-lending to agriculture, SMEs and housing; and reduced risk-weights for consumer loans.

In her Union Budget speech on July 5, the finance minister provided a one-time six months‚Äô partial credit guarantee to public sector banks for the first loss of up to 10% to purchase high-rated pooled assets from financially sound shadow banks amounting to Rs 1 trillion. It is too early to assess the impact of this measure as its operational guidelines have been issued on August 13, but the fact remains that this one-time facility is only meant for ‚Äúfinancially sound‚Äù shadow banks. In other words, the least risky shadow banks (such as HDFC and LIC Housing Finance) will benefit from this facility, not the cash-starved weaker entities such as DHFL and Reliance Capital.

On August 23, Nirmala Sitharaman announced additional liquidity support of Rs 200 billion to housing finance companies to be provided by the National Housing Bank, as part of a stimulus package. The minister also announced that public sector banks (PSBs) would fast track collaborations with shadow banks for loans to SMEs, small traders and microfinance institutions under the co-origination scheme introduced in last August by the RBI. Under this scheme, shadow banks will take a minimum of 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure while the co-originating PSB will take the rest of the credit risk.

This scheme allows shadow banks to expand their business and thereby book profits with little investments while the PSBs can meet their priority sector targets of lending to such sectors, albeit with higher credit risks. At the time of writing, there is no information available about the volume of loans disbursed under the co-origination scheme. As there are better and safer options available to the PSBs to achieve priority sector lending targets, they may not be willing to collaborate with ailing shadow banks unless they are forced to do so by New Delhi.

More importantly, it raises a pertinent question: why encourage public sector banks to increase lending to shadow banks? And particularly at a time when the capital-constrained PSBs already have considerable exposure to troubled shadow banks (such as DHFL and Reliance Capital) and are currently struggling to repair their balance sheets from the NPA crisis? Such policy moves would make public sector banks more vulnerable as the potential risks in the shadow banks will spillover to banks. PSBs account for nearly 70% of India‚Äôs banking sector and therefore raise potential financial stability concerns.

Rather, the strategy should be to ring-fence the current liquidity crisis in the shadow banking sector and thereby prevent the problems spilling over into the Indian banking sector.

In China and elsewhere, the authorities are trying to break the interlinkages between the shadow banks and banks to ensure the contagion risks arising out of a failure of large shadow banks in the banking sector are contained, and overall financial stability is preserved.

To restore the investors‚Äô confidence, the RBI should undertake the asset quality review of India‚Äôs shadow banks to bring all problems to the fore, similar to what the RBI conducted for commercial banks in 2015.

An inherent problem with the business model of shadow banks is their over-reliance on short-term funding to fund longer-term assets. To finance infrastructure and long-term industrial projects, New Delhi should set up specialised development finance institutions with explicit public policy mandates and higher standards of transparency and accountability.

37,"Ground Report | In Leh, Celebrations Give Way to Concerns over Land and Job Protections","Leh: On the eve of India‚Äôs 73rd Independence Day, and almost ten days after the announcement that Ladakh will be separated from Kashmir to become a union territory and the state‚Äôs special status will be removed, an air of jubilation hung in the picturesque town of Leh in one of the country‚Äôs most sparsely populated districts ‚Äì Ladakh.

A group of youngsters gathered at the main market in Leh to put up a banner reading ‚ÄòUnion Territory of Ladakh celebrates its 1st Independence Day‚Äô. All of them preferred anonymity. ‚ÄúIndependence from Kashmir,‚Äù explained one of them. ‚ÄúFor too long, we have been neglected by leaders from Kashmir who have only focused on the Valley.‚Äù

The next morning, as the flag hoisting ceremony was about to begin in Leh‚Äôs Polo Ground, patriotic songs from Hindi films blared from industrial-strength speakers. Each song was followed by cries of ‚ÄòBharat Mata ki Jai‚Äô and ‚ÄòJai Hind‚Äô from the master of ceremonies and the ever-increasing crowd.

‚ÄúIt is a very happy moment for us. It is a dream come true,‚Äù said Tsering Namdan, who was looking forward to the Independence Day ceremony and was particularly excited to catch a glimpse of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of the Indian cricket team, who, rumour went, would be present for the flag hoisting ceremony as part of his 15-day deployment with the territorial army.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding UT (union territory) status for 70 years and are very thankful to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah that they have fulfilled our demand. Now, we can look forward to fast-paced development,‚Äù Namdan said.

The demand for union territory status in Ladakh dates back to 1949. ‚ÄúWe have always held that we want to be separated from Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù P.T. Kunzang, president of the influential Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) told The Wire. ‚ÄúOur identity, culture, geography, way of life and food is different from J&K. That is why we wanted that Ladakh be separated and administered by the Centre.‚Äù

At the Independence Day ceremony, 19-year-old Tenzin Minkey stood with her fists tightly clenched as she watched columns of police personnel and school kids march to the military marching beat. As the columns would pass the Indian flag and offer a salute, Minkey would raise her fist and offer her cry of allegiance, ‚ÄúBharat Mata ki Jai!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have always been proud Indians. Today, we are free from the clutches of Kashmir that held us back for 70 years, and I am extremely happy. We had nothing to do with the conflict but our schools and colleges would also be shut when the situation would get tense in the Valley. We were made to learn Urdu, even when nobody here speaks Urdu,‚Äù she said.

Her father, Tenzin, was a little more circumspect. ‚ÄúThere is great enthusiasm right now, especially among the youth. However, the fact is that there is a lot of uncertainty. Protections on land and reservation of jobs are also gone now. That could create issues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToday, you are seeing an initial euphoria. But this will change in a few days.‚Äù

Concerns of the tribal population

Two days after breaking into a dance during the Independence Day celebrations, BJP‚Äôs member of parliament from Ladakh, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, appeared a little more subdued and circumspect. ‚ÄúAfter the Centre announced its decision to make Ladakh a union territory, the biggest concern of the tribal population here is to protect their identity, culture, land and economy,‚Äù he said while speaking at the launch of a national tribal festival in Leh in the presence of the Union minister of tribal affairs, Arjun Munda.

He also handed a letter to Munda outlining the vulnerability of Ladakh‚Äôs 98% tribal population owing to its ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô land-based economy, limited means of livelihood, undeveloped markets, harsh climate, close proximity to China and Pakistan borders, presence of Indian army and paramilitary forces and a fragile ecology under threat of climate change.

Namgyal urged Munda to declare Ladakh a tribal area under Article 244 ‚Äì which deals with the administration of scheduled and tribal areas ‚Äì and bring the new union territory under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution, which currently grants a degree of autonomy to four states in the Northeast.

Demands for autonomy

The demand is echoed by many leaders in the Leh district, including Kunzang, the president of LBA. He argued that now that the protections on land use and reservation of jobs no longer exist, there are a lot of ‚Äòapprehensions‚Äô and ‚Äòuncertainties. ‚ÄúThere need to be protections either under Article 371 or under Schedule 6 so that land and jobs are protected,‚Äù Kunzang said, predicting that in the absence of these protections, the people of Ladakh will suffer.

Due to the district being sparsely populated, he likened the people of Ladakh to tigers. ‚ÄúOur population is only about three lakhs. If people from all over the country start buying land and settling here, then we will be marginalised. Our culture will be lost. We need to be protected the way tigers are protected.‚Äù

Concerns over the loss of Ladakh‚Äôs unique culture and identity are now growing. ‚ÄúOurs is a very different culture from the rest of India, and if people from outside start settling here, that culture will be threatened. It will die,‚Äù said Tsewang Rigzen, who owns a small grocery store near Leh‚Äôs main market.

Tsering Morup, who stood outside the store, said that for this reason, it is crucial that Ladakh be brought under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution. ‚ÄúPeople in other Indian states are wealthier than people here. If they start buying land here, there will be nothing left for us.‚Äù

According to the constitutional expert and vice-chancellor of the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Faizan Mustafa, bringing Ladakh under Schedule 6 will grant it the kind of autonomy that it already had, as part of J&K, under Article 370. ‚ÄúAutonomy under Schedule 6 almost resembles the autonomy under the diluted Article 370 ‚Äì diluted by presidential orders over the years,‚Äù Mustafa told The Wire.

Since 1954, by a series of presidential orders, the Indian state extended 260 of its 395 Articles, 94 of the 97 entries in the union list, 26 of the 47 items in the concurrent list and seven of the 12 schedules to the state of J&K, thereby diluting its autonomy under Article 370.

‚ÄúLook, the reality is that we never demanded that Article 370 be revoked. We are not fools. We need those protections. But the government had to do it this way because their focus is the Valley and they can‚Äôt be seen to be going easy on them,‚Äù said a local leader who declined to be named. ‚ÄúSoon you will see that demands for autonomy, protection over land and jobs and a legislature will increase in Ladakh and the Centre will have to grant them.‚Äù

Not getting legislature a ‚Äòletdown‚Äô

The demand for union territory status has included the demand for a legislature with it, and the grant of former without the latter has caused disappointment. ‚ÄúWhile we are very happy that UT status has been granted, but not getting a legislature is a letdown. All political parties, social and religious organisations have always demanded UT status with the legislature,‚Äù said senior Congress leader and former minister in the J&K government, Rigzin Jora.

Kunzang agreed with Jora. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs disappointing to not get a legislature. That was our demand. But I am hopeful that the hill council will be granted legislative powers,‚Äù Kunzang said.

Hill councils

Leh and Kargil, the two districts in the newly-carved union territory of Ladakh, have retained their autonomous hill development councils, which came into existence in 1995 and 2003 respectively. Both have 30 councillors of which 26 are elected and four are nominated by the government of J&K. It is not yet clear who will nominate the members under the new arrangement.

The councils have powers to collect local taxes, regulate land use, prioritise the implementation of schemes, formulate budgets and others, making them among the most autonomous councils in India. Now, local leaders are hoping the councils will be empowered to legislate, granting the UT of Ladakh a degree of control over its laws.

As things stand, the councils can regulate the sale and purchase of state-owned land, but not private land, and that is a cause for worry. ‚ÄúSee, the land is an emotive issue here. We have a deep connect with the land and our economy too is dependent on it. So, it‚Äôs a big concern. Even with the hill councils, an individual can sell their own piece of land,‚Äù said Jora.

He argued that Ladakh turning into ‚Äòanother Manali or Shimla‚Äô will not be desirable. ‚ÄúIn Manali and Shimla, properties are owned by people from Mumbai, Gujarat. Locals are waiters and bartenders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want our boys and girls to become waiters and bartenders.‚Äù

Mehboob Ali, who owns three hotels in Leh, agrees with Jora. ‚ÄúAlthough, we are happy with the UT status, there are some worries also. If big hotel chains come here, then they will take over our land, our hotels. We will have to work under them. We want development, but on our own terms,‚Äù Ali said.

Fear of loss of jobs

The youth in Ladakh would prefer if the Centre provide a form of reservation of jobs. Tashi Namgyal, a second-year student of Bachelor of Arts at the government degree college in Leh, explained that reservations are needed because Leh lacks the kind of education facilities and infrastructure that exist in other parts of India.

‚ÄúIt will be difficult for us to compete with them. We have only one degree college and that also does not have any specialised courses. People from outside will come with specialisations,‚Äù Namgyal said.

Rigzin, who recently completed her BA, raised apprehensions over the loss of job opportunities, ‚ÄúThere are very few job opportunities as it is. If more people will settle in Ladakh, then that problem is going to increase further.‚Äù

Concerns over ecology

Namgyal also said that the fragile ecology of Ladakh has its limits, particularly with the impacts of climate change increasingly being felt, ‚ÄúAlready, we are seeing that we have less snow and more rain. On top of that, there is the issue of plastic and solid waste which will become more serious if more people start living here.‚Äù

According to Tsewang Dolma, who heads the Ladakh Ecological Development and Environmental Group, an NGO that promotes ecological and sustainable development in Ladakh, Leh is already overburdened as it plays host to around three lakh tourists every year ‚Äì twice the population of Leh district. ‚ÄúThere are no facilities for plastic waste treatment and barely anything for treatment of faecal waste,‚Äù she said.

To add to the growing woes, Dolma said, a water crisis looms in the cold desert every summer. ‚ÄúAlmost every household in Leh either has a homestay or a hotel. And with the number of tourists that we get, there is a huge water crisis.‚Äù

She suggests that new tourist spots be developed, a cap be fixed for the number of tourists and a tax be levied. ‚ÄúWe have to reduce the burden on Leh. The government can develop other tourist spots. It is also important to limit the number of tourists to say, 2,00,000, every year and charge an environment fee like Bhutan has done,‚Äù she said.

Otherwise, according to Dolma, the comparison, dreaded in these parts, will have to be made. ‚ÄúWe need safeguards, otherwise it will not take long for Leh to turn into another Manali or Shimla,‚Äù Dolma said.

Kunzang is hopeful that all the concerns will be taken care of before October 31, when the division of J&K takes effect. ‚ÄúWe have some time. We are forming committees which will look at each and every issue and negotiate with the government. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the issues,‚Äù he said.

A divided UT

As the new union territory of Ladakh heads towards an uncertain future, it also stands divided. As previously reported by The Wire, Kargil ‚Äì the other district which will form the new union territory ‚Äì has seen widespread protests and shutdowns since August 5, when the drastic steps were announced.

While the people of Kargil and Leh have broadly similar worries over the protection of land and reservation of jobs, their views differ on the bifurcation of the state. While Leh has since 1949 demanded that it be separated from J&K and administered by the Centre, Kargil has never stood by that demand, citing its close ties with the Kashmir Valley and aversion to further division of the state.

In the week after the decision to bifurcate the state was announced, the two districts saw very different reactions. Leh rejoiced, with fervent gusto initially and with some caution as time wore on. Kargil, on the other hand, has protested with the kind of intensity that has rarely been seen.

This has prompted the LBA to write to home minister Amit Shah to seek the protection of Buddhists in Kargil, who form 15% of the population in the Muslim-majority district. The organisation has claimed that there has been an attempt to ‚Äúinfuse communal hatred among the people of Kargil against the Buddhist community and there was an immediate need to ensure the safety and security of Buddhists living in Kargil district.‚Äù

Leaders of the joint action committee in Kargil have said that these worries are unfounded. ‚ÄúThere is no truth to this. It is an attempt by the LBA to dilute our struggle. Buddhists in Kargil have always lived without any fear and will continue to do so,‚Äù said Asgar Ali Karbalai, a former Congress MLA from Kargil and now a key member of the JAC.

He also stressed that the agitation in Kargil will continue. ‚ÄúSo far the government has not responded positively. So our agitation will only pick up now. We are against the division of the state and want to continue to be with J&K with our protection over land and jobs restored,‚Äù Karbalai said.

38,Goldman Sachs Sees More Pain in Store for the Indian Economy,"New Delhi: Analysts at Goldman Sachs see more pain in store for the Indian economy over the next few months despite the government‚Äôs stimulus unveiled last week. In their recent co-authored report titled India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown, Andrew Tilton, their chief Asia-Pacific economist expects this slowdown to last at least a couple of quarters more.

‚ÄúWeak global macroeconomic conditions, and a negative fiscal impulse are assumed to be a drag on economic activity. The risks to our outlook for economic activity for FY20 continue to be tilted to the downside, given the continued weakness in consumption indicators, and persistent confidence concerns emanating from NBFCs that the Goldman Sachs India Financials equity analysts have pointed out,‚Äù wrote Tilton in a co-authored report with Prachi Mishra and Sakshi Goenka.

The economic slowdown, they said, started in January 2018 and that problems at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) was a result of the overall slowdown that had already been seeded in the third quarter of 2017-18 when the goods and services tax (GST) was introduced. The current slowdown has lasted for over 18 months and is the longest incident of sluggishness since 2006, the report said.

Deep impact

Automobile sales ‚Äì a commonly used benchmark to gauge the slowdown in the consumption patterns ‚Äì Goldman Sachs believes ‚Äì is just the tip of the iceberg, with other consumption indicators like air passenger traffic, tax collections, and sales of durable and non-durable consumer goods contributing twice the effect of autos.

‚ÄúAutomobiles contributed 17 per cent of the total slowdown, as against a 36 per cent contribution by other consumption-driven factors including bank agriculture credit, vehicle sales, rural wages, fuel consumption, farm exports, fertiliser sales, rail/air passenger traffic, household credit, and electronic exports,‚Äù they wrote.

While fertiliser sales and rail passenger traffic were the only indicators that started to fall towards the end of 2018, several variables, such as agriculture credit, rural wage growth and imports of electronic goods have, in fact, been on a descent since 2017, Goldman Sachs said.

‚ÄúSome part of the slowdown could possibly also be associated with the implementation bottlenecks related to the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) in 2017. Effective credit crunch was consequent to the glitches in the GST refund system which tightened the working capital cycle in the industry, especially for the MSME sector. Year-on-year growth in bank credit started to slow only in late 2018, driven by credit to services; and appears to be a symptom of the slowdown, rather than a cause,‚Äù they noted.

A slowdown in the investment activity, tighter funding conditions, a decline in consumer confidence, high real interest rates, central government expenditure and monsoon were some of the factors that contributed to the overall sluggishness.

‚ÄúThe role of global factors is also very significant; slower growth in India‚Äôs trading partners acted as a major drag on economic activity during this period,‚Äù they said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut repo rate by 110 basis points (bps) since February 2019, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel, the breadth and depth of policy easing have so far been much more limited than during previous occurrences of slower growth in India.

‚ÄúImportantly, policymakers have exercised restraint in easing fiscal policies. Despite being issued in a period marked by a slowing economy and an election year, the FY20 budget did not envisage any additional stimulus through the reported fiscal deficit figures,‚Äù they wrote.

39,"Bengal: Left Student Activists, Police Clash at Protest Against Unemployment","Howrah: Clashes broke out here on Friday between the police and the Left Front activists when they were marching towards the West Bengal secretariat demanding employment for the youth of the state.

LF leaders claimed that around 60 activists were injured in the clashes, five of them critically, while the police said people on both sides were wounded.

According to sources, police burst tear gas shells and used water cannons to disperse CPI(M) youth and student activists, who in turn hurled stones at them.

Members of Students Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) had taken out a rally on Thursday from Singur, the venue of the abandoned Tata small car plant, demanding jobs for the youth of the state.

The rally was scheduled to culminate at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon, but was stopped 5 km away near Mullick Ghat in Howrah.

Sources said the activists in their attempt to move forward broke one of the three barricades set up by the police at Mullick Ghat.

A scuffle broke out with the agitators hurling bricks at the police, who retaliated by bursting tear gas shells and baton charge, they said.

The injured have been admitted to a nearby government hospital for treatment, the police said.

‚ÄúWe were told by the police that five of our representatives would be allowed to enter the state secretariat to submit a memorandum. But as soon as our peaceful rally reached Mullick Ghat, police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge and bursting of tear gas shells,‚Äù DYFI state secretary Sayandeep Mitra said.

A number of SFI and DYFI workers fell unconscious during the clash, he said.

‚ÄúWe were to submit thousands of applications seeking jobs and answers on various other issues from chief minister Mamata Banerjee as part of the TMC government‚Äôs ‚ÄòDidi ke bolo‚Äò public outreach initiative,‚Äù Mitra told reporters.

Banerjee is referred to as ‚ÄòDidi‚Äô or elder sister by rank and file of the party.

The Mamata Banerjee government is sitting on the ‚Äúdebris of an industry‚Äù at Singur, he said.

‚ÄúShe has failed to bring about economic development in West Bengal. Several business summits were organised over the past few years but no investment has been made. Lakhs of youths are unemployed,‚Äù the Left youth leader added.

Later in the evening, the SFI and DYFI district units took out protest marches in various parts of the state.

The two Left bodies have decided to observe a two-day-long ‚ÄòBlack day‚Äô across the state in the weekend to protest against the police assault.

West Bengal Left Front Chairman and CPI(M) Politburo member Biman Bose condemned the ‚Äúbrutal attack‚Äù on the students and youth activists.

Also read: A Simmering Unemployment Crisis in India

‚ÄúThe way student and youth activists were attacked reflects the authoratarian attitude of the state government,‚Äù CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, who too is a member of the politburo, said.

Countering the allegations, West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said the Left Front activists were trying to disturb the ‚Äúpeaceful atmosphere‚Äù in the state.

‚ÄúWhat was SFI and DYFI doing during the Left Front rule when industries were being shut down and flight of capital from Bengal took place? Were they sleeping? Our government has revived industry in the state,‚Äù Chatterjee, who is also the secretary general of TMC, said.

Singur had become the hotbed of West Bengal politics in 2008 after the Trinamool Congress of Mamata Banerjee led an agitation against the erstwhile Left Front government over acquisition of farm land the car factory.

The TMC agitation eventually led to the exit of the proposed small car factory and catapulted Banerjee to power in 2011."
40,"As India's Economy Suffers a Car Crash, Pain Spreads to Villages","Manesar: The narrow lanes in Aliyar and Kasan villages in Manesar, an automotive manufacturing hub on New Delhi‚Äôs southern outskirts, would usually be packed on Sundays with migrant workers employed at the nearby plants enjoying their day off, but not anymore.

These are hard times for an area dependent on the fortunes of companies like Maruti Suzuki, the car maker with the largest market share in India, and motorbike maker Honda Motor Co‚Äôs local unit. The auto and component makers in and around Manesar, have shed thousands of jobs.

Nationwide, according to industry estimates, automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since the start of the year, in response to plunging car sales. Figures for August, like July, are expected to show a drop of more than 30%, making a 10th straight month of decline.

As the crisis in the sector bites harder small businesses in the towns and villages around Manesar, home to one of the three plants where Maruti Suzuki cars are made, have seen a fall-off in trade.

‚ÄúThere are already fewer workers in the village and those who still have jobs are either not getting paid for working overtime or are not spending as much out of fear they may lose work and need the money,‚Äù said grocer Rahul Jain, his shelves stacked with toothpaste and soaps from fast-moving consumer goods companies like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Dabur India.

Even sales of products like cooking oil and flour have fallen. On the lower rungs of the service sector, barbers and tea stall owners said they had fewer customers.

Shoe seller Subhay Singh, in Manesar‚Äôs Aliyar village, has days when he doesn‚Äôt make a single sale.

‚ÄúMy monthly earnings have halved,‚Äù said Singh, who a year ago made an average Rs 8,000 a day. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

In the United States there was an old adage: ‚ÄúWhen General Motors sneezes, the Wall Street catches a cold.‚Äù In India, the impact goes well beyond the stock market.

India‚Äôs automotive industry is the fourth largest in the world, employing more than 35 million people, directly and indirectly, and accounting for nearly half of India‚Äôs manufacturing output.

The industry has three main centres; Gurugram in the North, Chennai in the South, where among others Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor have plants, and Pune in the West, where Tata Motors and Fiat are located.

All of them are hurting, and the pain is radiating outwards.

Needing a Haircut

Before suffering the steepening slump in sales, the auto industry provided one of the few bright spots for manufacturing. Its troubles stem in part from banks‚Äô and non-banking finance houses‚Äô reluctance to extend consumer loans, as well as subdued demand, particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of Indians live.

Laid-off workers returning to their villages are now putting more burden on a rural sector already suffering falling income from low crop prices and dampening consumer sentiment and growth across the country.

Gurmeet Singh had been earning Rs 10,000 a month until he lost his job at auto component maker Bellsonica in Manesar. Six months later, back in his hometown of Ambala in Haryana state, Singh is still looking for a job, and catastrophising about the future.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had a hair cut in months, my shoes are torn and I‚Äôve been using the same pair of clothes since I lost my job. Only I know how I am surviving,‚Äù said the 26-year-old.

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get a job, how will I build a house for my family, get married and pay off the loan my parents took to educate me?‚Äù he said.

His bleak outlook reflects an increasingly grim big picture. India‚Äôs economic growth slipped to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was re-elected to a second term in a landslide in May, is under pressure to provide a stimulus for an economy that is seriously undershooting the growth rate needed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young Indians entering the labour market every month.

Resisting a haircut

All this is cast against a backdrop of a weakening world economy, and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the United States and China.

Things are so manifestly bad that even one of the nation‚Äôs most popular biscuit makers, Parle Products Private Limited, is worried about the impact of the auto industry‚Äôs troubles on sales.

‚ÄúIf the economy is buoyant then even the rural consumer will not mind paying a little extra. But this (slowdown) has acted as a catalyst to the drop in demand,‚Äù said Mayank Shah, product category head at Parle.

Britannia Industries Ltd, which controls a third of the biscuits market in India, said it has ‚Äúnever seen this kind of a slowdown‚Äù where people are hesitant to buy a pack of biscuits costing just Rs 5 ($0.07).

‚ÄúIf the consumer is thinking twice before buying, then obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy,‚Äù Varun Berry, the company‚Äôs managing director told analysts in a post-earnings call last month.

Under pressure from businesses and investors to provide more stimulus, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures last month to help the economy and financial markets but some economists said it would not be enough to revive long-term demand.

On Aug 23, foreign investment rules were eased for several sectors, and sources say the government is expected to come up with more measures such as tax cuts for autos and real estate.

‚ÄúThe real revenue growth for auto and consumer goods sectors started declining nearly two years ago. The slowdown has merely gained prominence now,‚Äù said Arindam Som, an analyst at India Ratings, a Fitch group company, adding that he expects auto companies to further cut production.

A year ago, Vinod Chauhan had no vacancies at all in the 70 rooms he leased primarily to migrant workers in Manesar‚Äôs Kasan village. Today, over a third of those rooms are vacant and Chauhan fears things could get worse before they get better.

His son won‚Äôt be getting the new car that Chauhan planned to buy him this year, and the landlord has also shelved plans to build another 100 hostel apartments.

‚ÄúIf I am not able to rent out all the rooms I currently have, how will I manage with more?‚Äù said Chauhan.

41,State of the Economy Is Deeply Worrying: Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said the state of the economy was ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù and urged the government to put aside ‚Äúvendetta politics‚Äù and reach out to sane voices and thinking minds to steer the economy out of this ‚Äúman-made crisis‚Äù.

The Congress leader said ‚Äúall-round mismanagement‚Äù by the Modi government was responsible for the slowdown.

‚ÄúThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 pc signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slow down,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Targeting the government, Singh said the country‚Äôs youth, farmers and farm workers, entrepreneurs and the marginalised sections deserve better.

India cannot afford to continue down this path, he said, adding, ‚ÄúI urge the government to put aside vendetta politics, and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds, to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.‚Äù

Singh said it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6%.

‚ÄúThis makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST,‚Äù he said.

The former prime minister alleged that institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded.

On the government taking Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the RBI reserves, Singh said the resilience of the RBI will be tested after this record transfer to the government.

This, he said, ‚Äúclaims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall‚Äù.

Noting that domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18-month low and nominal GDP growth is at a 15-year low, he said, ‚ÄúThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiments are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recover‚Äù.

Blaming the Modi government‚Äôs policies for massive job-less growth, he said more than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone.

There will similarly be large-scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting most vulnerable workers, he said.

He said rural India is in terrible shape as farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined.

The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their incomes, by inflicting misery on over 50% of India‚Äôs population, he alleged.

Watch: How Will RBI‚Äôs 1.76 Lakh Crore Reserve Transfer Help The Economy?

The former prime minister, a noted economist, said the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

‚ÄúBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase its exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignments. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government,‚Äù he alleged.

The scathing attack by the former prime minister comes after the country reported a slow GDP growth rate of 5% for the first quarter of this fiscal.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product growth to over six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter of 2019-20."
42,Can India's Rich Wealth Creators Boost the Economy to $5 Trillion?,"Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Independence Day, said that wealth creation is a national service and that wealth creators should not be viewed with suspicion.

Furthermore, he added, only when wealth is created can it be distributed.

Wealth creation is a great national service. Let us never see wealth creators with suspicion. Only when wealth is created, wealth will be distributed. Wealth creation is absolutely essential. Those who create wealth are India‚Äôs wealth and we respect them: PM @narendramodi ‚Äî PMO India (@PMOIndia) August 15, 2019



These statements come at a time when the economy is facing severe headwinds and yet, the prime minister has set a tough target of almost doubling the economy to $5 trillion in the next five years. Even if it is in nominal rupee terms, including a depreciation of the rupee by 15%, it would require an average 16% rate of growth over the next five years. Investments which have been significantly down compared to their peak in 2012-13 have refused to show an uptrend and without that, the target is unachievable.

Private investors are not boosting their investment significantly. The rich are unhappy about the additional cess levied on incomes above Rs 2 crore in the budget presented in July. Other changes pertaining to the corporate sector have also acted as a spoiler for businessmen. Important corporate leaders, who were earlier supporters of the current ruling dispensation, are ticked off enough to speak out about the deteriorating climate for investment. They have also complained of tax terrorism by the tax departments.

Modi‚Äôs words on Independence Day therefore were a balm to the frayed nerves of the business community.

Also read: In U-Turn, FM Nirmala Sitharaman Rolls Back FPI Tax Announced in Budget

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman followed it up this week after announcing some sops to the investors. This came on the back of Niti Aayog boss Rajiv Kumar saying that India hasn‚Äôt seen a liquidity crisis like this in the last 70 years. Prior to that, the RBI governor and members of the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister had also stated that there is a slowdown. The concessions now announced by the finance minister are also an admission of a declining economy.

But is it not too little too late. Sitharaman maintained that Indian economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. So, the package announced caters to the corporate sectors and not to the root cause of the problem. It shows the clout of the corporate sector with the government and the belief that they are the wealth creators and need to be mollified.

But are businessmen the only wealth creators?

In India there are about 35 million demat accounts. Presumably they represent those who trade in the stock markets. That is less than 3% of the population. But most of the stocks are held by a tiny percent of the corporates, foreign portfolio investments (FP!s) and financial institutions.

A large number of people also save small sums of money and invest it. These are the households, the savers whose money is invested in financial assets and banks, and from the banks it goes to the investors. So, while encouraging businesses, one should not forget the workers, farmers, the officegoers, etc. ‚Äì we should celebrate everyone. But Modi did not mention them and Sitharaman has not catered to them.

Stagnant rate

The moot point is why is the investment rate stagnant? Output and employment have been stagnant or declining. Not only is enough new work is not being created for those entering the labour force, but workers have been losing employment as various surveys show. Consequently, as real income has declined for a large segment of the workers, demand has fallen short.

Furthermore, according to an OXFAM report, disparities have grown rapidly with nine people having as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the population. And, the top 1% of the population hold 51% of the national wealth. Clearly, the top wealth holders have been cornering a disproportionate share of the wealth and incomes of the economy. So, do they need more incentive or is it those at the bottom who need more support?

This kind of extreme inequality raises the question ‚Äì who should be taxed how much? According to the ‚Äòability to pay‚Äô principle of taxation, those with higher incomes and wealth ought to pay not only higher taxes but higher tax rates.

After the global crisis in 2007-08, Warren Buffet said that the rich need to pay more tax for capitalism to survive. This has been repeated again recently. Buffet‚Äôs statement was supported by the rich in the US, Germany, Italy and France. But the Indian rich do not seem to want to pay more taxes.

How much more tax the rich should pay is a political decision.

Fixing rates

An income of Rs 2 crore is 160 times the current per capita income. There are very few people in this category. According to tax data, 1.5 lakh individuals declare an income above Rs 1 crore. The number of people declaring an income above Rs 5 crore is 6,361. The number declaring an income above Rs 2 crore is around 40,000. The number of tax filers in India in 2018-19 was 61 million. So, those impacted by the higher tax rate would be only 0.1% of the tax payers and 0.004% of the population.

The new tax rates after the increase in surcharge are comparable to what people earning similar amounts pay in some of the advanced countries like, Germany. In reality the tax rates paid by the rich are much less than what appears to be on paper. They take advantage of innumerable concessions and deductions allowed to them and they resort to black income generation by declaring only a part of their incomes. Warren Buffet once said that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary because of these tax concessions. In India, the situation is likely to be even worse given the resort to large black income generation by the rich.

The Indian rich unfortunately compare the tax rates on paper to those in some of the developing countries or in the South East Asian economies. Since capital has become highly mobile, they threaten to leave India. There are 90 tax havens and funds can be easily moved out through them through the process of ‚Äòlayering‚Äô, erasing the trail for the agencies to catch them.

Flight of capital

Further, since 2014, 23,000 of these rich people, called high net-worth individuals (HNWI), have left India. So, a large number of ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are voting with their feet?

Flight of capital is a risk minimisation strategy to relocate in tax havens which offer low tax rates and a high degree of secrecy. The US has been complaining that rich companies have been relocating their offices to jurisdictions with low tax rates, like, Google and Starbucks moving to Ireland. This is called BEPS (Base Erosion Profit Shifting). So, globally, many of the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are more concerned about their profits and less about national well-being.

The Indian economy has suffered due to the shocks administered by the government in the form of demonetisation and GST. Add to this the non-bank financial institution and the non-performing assets problem of the financial sector. Though the official data does not reflect it, the economy has been tanking with capacity utilisation at around 75%. This is the real cause of the lack of pick up in private investment and cannot be countered by cut in tax rates or cuts in interest rates or by a boost to the stock markets as the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô have been demanding. The RBI has cut interest rates by 1% over the last one year and the stock market has been on a high but investment rate has not budged.

In the current quarter, the official nominal rate of growth is about 7% so how can it be raised to 16% if the private sector investment does not rise sharply. Foreign investment is small and uncertain given global and national uncertainties. Meanwhile, the government has proposed Rs 100 lakh crore investment in five years.

But this year, the capital expenditure in the budget is pegged at Rs 8.5 lakh crore (including the public sector) ‚Äì nowhere close to the average of Rs 20 lakh crore targeted. So, the prospects of reaching $5 trillion by 2024 are bleak even if the rich are incentivised and their hurt feelings are soothed from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

43,Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea,"Parle Products‚Äô announcement that it may have to let go up to 10,000 employees has caused a stir as big as news of a recession in the auto sector. Demand has been falling and government policies have further exacerbated the crisis, says the company.

Surely people can afford a packet of biscuits, one might ask. And that is true. But the news indicates something deeper, that people‚Äôs purchasing power has reduced so much that they are holding back from spending on even low price products. It shows that India is in, or at least is heading towards, a recession and no one seems to have a clue on how to handle it.

A biscuit cannot be compared with a car ‚Äì the latter is a one-time buy that doesn‚Äôt get changed very often, while consumers buy biscuits regularly, often several times a week. That people are reluctant to commit a few lakhs is understandable, but when they demur from spending as little as Rs 5, it is indicative of a deep economic crisis.

The allure of Parle G

A senior executive from the company had once told me that there was no part of India, however remote, where Parle G biscuits were not available. He had been to distant villages in the Himalayas, tiny hamlets in the hinterland and on generally inaccessible trekking routes, and found at least one shop with the biscuit on its shelves. He put it down not just to an efficient distribution network but also to the fact that there was a demand for Parle G, which meant that the shopkeepers themselves sought it out.

The biscuit, said the executive, fulfilled many kinds of requirements. It could be had at the start of the day with a cup of piping hot tea, it was a snack to be packed in children‚Äôs lunchboxes, a quick bite whenever someone was hungry and lunch was some time away, and a nutritious sugar boost to a labourer.

Also Read: The Life of Labour: RSS-Affiliated Union Slams NITI Aayog; Job Cuts on the Horizon

Most of all, it was cheap. It was a company mantra, he said, that a packet of Parle G biscuits would cost the same year after year. Of course, prices changed, but the company ensured that the entry-level price points would hold steady. This was done by changing packet sizes or through other ways, but the price remained the same. Taxes, if any, were incorporated into the final price. For the buyer, especially those who could not afford to spend more, it appeared that while prices of all essential goods ‚Äì everything really ‚Äì went up all the time, this was a constant. It added to the appeal of the product.

There are other brand attributes too ‚Äì quality is one, trust is another, and now, increasingly, nostalgia. Indian students living overseas frequently ask visiting friends and relatives to bring Parle G packets. Faced with changes in market trends, the company had banked heavily on nostalgia to remind customers of their product. Millennials have several more snack choices and for a demographic which seeks out ‚Äòartisanal cookies‚Äô, Parle G may appear old fashioned, a relic from an earlier time.

But those are normal challenges of the market place, as is competition. The company has, over the years, still maintained its leadership position and only expanded. But where changing tastes could not affect it, the government‚Äôs policies have. The imposition of GST drove prices up, and along with growing unemployment, job losses, and a bleak outlook for the future means that even a packet of biscuits has begun looking like a discretionary spend.

Other concerning developments

People cannot do without lunch, but they can forego another cup of tea, and with it, a biscuit or two. For a daily wage worker or a contract labourer, every rupee counts ‚Äì the uncertainty that there may not be any job, and therefore wages tomorrow, means it becomes imperative to save every paisa. Even for the salaried person, there is no guarantee that the job will exist in a few months; the auto sectors travails get a lot of media attention, but companies, big, medium and small are laying off large numbers of people without media coverage.

The collapse of Jet Airways meant that thousands of well-qualified, hardworking professionals found themselves jobless overnight, with little or no chance of getting back wages. They have mortgages, rents and school fees to pay ‚Äì they would undoubtedly think ten times before taking a vacation. The same applies on a different scale to the construction worker, who with no building activity anywhere, will think ten times before buying that packet of biscuits.

Industry associations have asked the government to provide relief to help keep their businesses running. This is understandable, though a pure classical free market economist might argue that these are the vagaries of business and therefore industrialists shouldn‚Äôt ask for the government for help. Grow up and don‚Äôt run to Papa like kids, is what the government‚Äôs economic adviser has told businessmen. (They may find this suggestion gratuitous, but don‚Äôt expect any businessmen to respond or complain in public.)

But the fact is that the government needs to attend to the growing sense of despair at the condition of the economy. Big business will find ways to tide over the crisis, even if it means letting go of employees and downsizing. But the small man has no safety net. He has no savings to fall back on, nor any government dole to rely on.

The NREGA scheme

At one time, schemes like the NREGA brought income to the unemployed all over the country ‚Äì they got jobs, wages and a sense of dignity. During the much-maligned UPA government‚Äôs administration, industrial and contract wages shot up because labourers preferred to go to their villages and get employment under NREGA. That has been curtailed and even if the government would like to, it cannot revive it in any significant way because it has no money to pay.

One of the big issues about GST is that back payments have been stuck in the pipeline for months ‚Äì that is a double whammy, since it not only sucks money out of businesses, it makes the products expensive and unaffordable.

The lack of investment by businesses, banks holding back loans, the collapse of NBFCs and the chaos created by demonetisation and the poor design and implementation of the GST has meant that no new jobs are being created. Old jobs have been lost, there is no growth and people have no money to spend. It is a vicious circle and a government preoccupied with its political and ideological agenda has little or no time to revive the economy.

The buzz words are there and the budget was all about ‚Äònudging‚Äô behaviour and competing with China to become a $5 trillion economy by the time the next elections roll around. To the industrialists who are holding back from expanding because they are not sure of demand, there is no clarity on how the government will facilitate investment to become a global player; to the salaried person who worries she may not be able to pay her EMIs, grand statements about the future mean little. And for the daily wage worker, all that matters is regular work so that he can buy a packet of biscuits for his family.

Economists talk about the ‚Äòunderwear index‚Äô which can detect the beginnings of economic recovery during a slump. There should now be a ‚Äòbiscuit index‚Äô that indicates that the economy is now in acute economic distress. The pleas of industrialists may not move the government, but the news of a fall in the sale of biscuits should make it wake up and smell the masala chai."

Slowdown in various sectors to cost lakhs of jobs

As reported earlier in this column, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades costing lakhs of jobs and set to affect many more. Another labour-intensive sector, textile, is staring at a slowdown that could cost and has requested to the government to intervene to avoid job losses and prevent NPAs in the spinning sector. The Northern India Textile Mills Association (NITMA) has placed full-page advertisements in newspapers to urge the government to act on their demands.

An estimated 40,000 people employed by the diamond cutting and polishing units in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have lost their jobs in the past few months, The Tribune reported.

Parle Products, country‚Äôs largest biscuit maker has warned that it may have to let go of 8,000 to 10,000 employees owing to slowdown in consumption. Another biscuit giant, Britannia, has voiced similar concerns saying consumers are thinking twice before buying even Rs 5 products. Britannia managing director Varun Berry says this indicates ‚Äúa serious issue in the economy‚Äù.

Strike at 41 ordnance factories halts defence production

After the government announced its decision to corporatise ordnance factories, around 80,000-1 lakh employees across 41 factories started a month-long strike on Tuesday. Ordnance factories supply arms, ammunitions and other equipment exclusively to Indian armed forces. The decision to corporatise was taken after ‚Äúthe Comptroller Auditor General (CAG), the government‚Äôs auditor, and the armed forces, repeatedly raised issue of quality and delays in delivery of equipment by the ordnance factories,‚Äù Hindustan Times reported.

However, employee unions in the factories have vehemently opposed this move. All trade unions, including the RSS‚Äôs Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, have offered support and solidarity to the striking employees. Unions have claimed that the strike was total on the first day and there was no production. Employees call this move arbitrary saying, ‚Äúordnance factories, being war-reserve and solely dependent on the armed forces, cannot function as a commercially viable PSU‚Äù.

The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which oversees the factories, is perhaps the oldest government-run entity in India, predating even the Railways.

RSS-affiliated trade union criticises ‚Äòwrong‚Äô labour policies, slams NITI Aayog

At its 144th national committee meeting in Delhi last weekend, RSS-affiliated BMS criticised the government‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù economic and labour policies. While accepting that the government was trying ‚Äúits level best‚Äù to boost economy, employment and skill development, the BMS said all these efforts were negated by ‚Äúwrong direction‚Äù of policy making bodies. ‚ÄúTheir main role ends up in converting India‚Äôs economy into a capitalist economy and all other developmental activities become ancillary,‚Äù their statement said.

They called for an India-centric development plan ‚Äúrather than that dictated by western rating agencies and institutions like WTO, WB and IMF‚Äù. They asked for restructuring of the NITI Aayog so as to ‚Äúremove its apathy‚Äù towards social organisations and trade unions. Hitting out at the policy think tank of the government, it added that ‚ÄúHarvard university experts who have no knowledge about Indian realities are the last word for them‚Äù.

While the BMS earlier welcomed the Wage Code Bill, the statement says that the ‚Äúso called labour law reforms‚Äù have contributed in damaging our economy. ‚ÄúThe Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) welcomes this codification and simplification of labour laws. But we opposed many of the anti-worker provisions in the labour codes,‚Äù it said, adding that six units in a family should be considered while deciding minimum wages. This, they say, is to be in sync with social realities of today that includes ageing parents.

They also flagged the crisis in the auto sector and said disinvestment from public sector has caused ‚Äúpanic‚Äù in the minds of the employees. The statement added that rise in contractualisation was a sign of ‚Äúfalling and distressed‚Äù private sector, adding that privatisation can‚Äôt be a remedy for the economy.

Threefold rise in number of manual scavengers despite ban

An RTI filed by The Wire has revealed that the number of manual scavengers in India has gone up from 14,505 in 2013 to 41,420 in 2018. This after a 2013 law had banned the practice of manual scavenging altogether.

The National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC), which works under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, had conducted a survey in 170 districts of 18 states. In those districts, a total of 86,528 people described their work as ‚Äúmanual cleaning of waste‚Äù. Oddly, the government identified only about half of them (41,420) as manual scavengers even when all had registered their occupation as the same.

Bihar, Haryana, Telangana and J&K have claimed they have no manual scavengers employed in their states.

Workers seize the shipyard that built the Titanic, plan to make renewable energy there

‚ÄúLate last month, 130 ship builders, steel workers, welders, and riveters seized control of the storied Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic in 1909,‚Äù Vice reported on August 14. The workers are demanding that the docks be nationalised and be used to produce renewable energy. The docks were being shut down as the Norwegian parent company failed to find a buyer but the workers have refused to leave the site.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs massive potential in wind turbines and tidal energy. They‚Äôre saying they could create thousands of jobs, and that we need a just transition to renewable energy,‚Äù a spokesperson for Unite, which represents the workers, told Vice.

This is an unconventional and welcome change for climate activists as workers show eagerness to transition to renewable energy.

45,"Economic Slowdown 'Very Worrisome', New Set of Reforms Needed: Raghuram Rajan","New Delhi: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has called slowdown in the economy ‚Äúvery worrisome‚Äù and said the government needs to fix the immediate problems in power and non-bank financial sectors and come out with a new set of reforms to energise the private sector to invest.

Rajan, who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016 but was denied a second term, also called for a fresh look at the way GDP in India is calculated, as he referred to research by Narendra Modi government‚Äôs former chief economist Arvind Subramanian about overestimation of growth rate.

‚ÄúThere are a variety of growth projections from the private sector analysts, many of which are perhaps significantly below government projections and I think certainly the slowdown in the economy is something that is very worrisome,‚Äù Rajan told CNBC TV18.

Also read: RBI Likely to Cut Policy Rate by 25 Bps Amid Concerns of Economic Slowdown

India‚Äôs economic growth has slowed to 6.8% in 2018-19 ‚Äì the slowest pace since 2014-15, and various projections by private experts and the Central bank estimate that the GDP growth in the current year will be less than the government‚Äôs estimate of 7%.

In ominous signs that the slowdown may be deep, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades with reports suggesting thousands of job losses in the automobile and ancillary industry, real estate sector has huge unsold inventory, while fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have reported a decline in volume growth.

‚ÄúYou can hear businesses all around worrying and complaining out loud that they need some kind of stimulus,‚Äù he said.

Rajan said ‚Äúa fresh set of reforms‚Äù are now needed to boost the economy and growth rate.

‚ÄúWe need a fresh set of reforms informed by view on what we want India to be and I would love for that view to be articulated at the very top (that) here is the kind of economy that we want. One-off programs here and there don‚Äôt amount to a comprehensive reform agenda for the economy,‚Äù he said, adding borrowing in international markets is not really a reform but a ‚Äútactical action‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat we really need is an understanding of how we are going to propel this country by the two or three percentage points greater growth that it needs and that needs fixing the immediate problems such as in the power sector, such as in the non-bank financial sector and those need to be done yesterday, not in the next six months, it is very important that those be tackled immediately,‚Äù he said.

Rajan advocated for a new set of reforms to get the private sector to invest.

‚ÄúWe need a new set of reforms, which energise the private sector to invest. Sops, stimulus of one kind or the other are not going to be that useful in the longer-term especially given the very tight fiscal situation that we have. Instead bold reforms, well thought of, not jumping off the cliff, but really seriously thought out reforms in a variety of areas which energise the Indian people, energise the Indian markets and energise Indian business.

‚ÄúThis is what we need today and I really hope we put our best minds to think about this because absent that my sense is that we are in for not so good times,‚Äù he said.

The former governor also drew attention to former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs research that GDP growth was overestimated by 2.5% during 2011-12 and 2016-17.

‚ÄúI also think that we should pay attention to some of the arguments made by the former chief economist Arvind Subramanian that in fact we may be overestimating growth with some of the new GDP data and I would suggest ‚Äì I have been saying this for some time ‚Äì we need fresh look from an independent group of experts at the way we compute GDP and make sure that we are not in a sense having GDP numbers that mislead and cause the wrong kinds of policy actions,‚Äù he said.

On the ongoing global economic slowdown, Rajan said that in comparison to the 2008 financial crisis, the banks are better levered across the globe.

‚ÄúHistory never repeats. So, I think there is more leverage than there was in 2008 but it is not in the same places. Banks are less levered than they were then. On the other hand, some corporate sectors, certainly in the United States are more levered, certainly in China are more levered and of course governments are more levered,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, leverage was the big factor in 2008, it is different today. Not necessarily better, but different.‚Äù

Rajan said that he can‚Äôt predict another big financial crash but if it comes, it will be from different sources.

‚ÄúThe big issue today is not so much the financial sector frenzy, there is some but real (issue) is trade and global investments and the worries are that if we don‚Äôt pay enough attention, the old global order is going out of the window and there is nothing really to replace it to keep countries from doing things that serve their own interest rather than the global interest. So, it is a different world,‚Äù he said.

Asked about 2008 meltdown repeating, he said: ‚ÄúDo I predict a big crash coming? I don‚Äôt know but I do think that it is going to come from different sources and simply fixing the old problems is not going to prevent the new ones‚Äù."
46,"Mahindra Warns of Job Losses in Auto Sector, Seeks Government Help","Mumbai/Bengaluru: Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Wednesday it saw a ‚Äúhuge danger‚Äù of job losses in the ailing domestic auto sector, as it sought government intervention, including tax reductions to revive demand.

A lending crisis among the country‚Äôs shadow banks, which fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles and 30% of passenger cars, has led to automakers, including M&M and its rivals Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, to either cut production or temporarily close plants.

M&M said in a statement it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices and the government must reduce the Goods and Services tax (GST) rate to spur demand.

A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectly. Reuters reported on Tuesday that initial estimates suggest automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April.

47,Two Lakh Jobs Cut in Last 3 Months Across Automobile Dealerships: FADA,"New Delhi: Around two lakh jobs have been cut across automobile dealerships in India in the last three months as vehicle retailers take the last resort of cutting manpower to tide over the impact of the unprecedented sales slump, according to industry body FADA.

With no immediate signs of recovery, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government intervention such as reduction of GST to provide relief to the auto industry.

‚ÄúThe majority of job cuts have happened in the last three months. It started around May and continued through June and July,‚Äù FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI.

He further said, ‚ÄúRight now most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this (slowdown) continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less, so it is a cycle.‚Äù

When asked how many jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India, he said, ‚ÄúClose to about two lakh.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a guesstimate that our members have already cut 7-8% of the jobs in most of the dealerships as the degrowth has been very high,‚Äù he added.

Around 2.5 million people were employed directly through around 26,000 automobile showrooms operated by 15,000 dealers. Another 2.5 million are indirectly employed in the dealership ecosystem, he added.

The two lakh jobs cuts in the last three months are over and above the 32,000 people who lost employment when 286 showrooms were closed across 271 cities in the 18-month period ended April this year, he added.

Stating that more dealerships have closed in the past three months, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are collating the figures again. In a few cases some (dealers) have gone for closure of outlets, not the main outlets but those which were put up anticipating some geographic reach.‚Äù

Elaborating on reasons for taking the drastic step of cutting jobs, he said the ‚Äòmargin of error‚Äô in the business in the past few years has really gone down with cost almost doubling in the last three to four years.

‚ÄúThe margin that we earn overall as a business has not gone up. Therefore, if we go into a degrowth situation we get into cash loss. So to avoid that, dealers have been cutting down on costs other than manpower. Till March this year none of the dealers went for any manpower correction because we thought this was a temporary slowdown and it will soon recover,‚Äù he said.

However, he said, ‚ÄúThe way the first quarter has panned out despite good election results and the Budget, the degrowth continued. It is clear now that a proper slowdown has hit us. Now dealers have resorted to cutting manpower.‚Äù

Terming manpower as ‚Äòthe most precious resource of dealers‚Äô, Kale said, ‚ÄúThat is the last thing we try to cut down. When the slowdown started we first decided that we should go for stock reduction. Most of OEMs have supported us. While cutting other variable expenses that we can, we did not touch manpower till March and almost mid-April.‚Äù

Ruing the loss of jobs, he said, ‚ÄúIt is the last resort because it is difficult to get those manpower. We invest a lot on training them because it is a peculiar industry, whether it is a technical or a field job.‚Äù

As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) figures, vehicle wholesale across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.

On the other hand, as per data based on registrations collated by FADA, automobile retail sales in the April-June period declined by 6% to 51,16,718 units in the first quarter of this fiscal as against 54,42,317 units in the year-ago period.

Passenger vehicles (PV) segment has been the worst hit with sales continuing to decline for almost a year now. In July, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 36.3% drop in its domestic PV wholesales, while Hyundai saw a dip of 10%.

M&M sales were down 16%, Tata Motors‚Äô PV sales fell 31% while that of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) also came down 48.67% during the month.

Seeking immediate government intervention, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are hoping, from whatever we are hear that the government has taken note of the serious situation that is going on in the overall economy, specifically with the auto sector. We are hoping for some support for the auto sector in the next few days or week or two.‚Äù He said the auto industry has already put out a request for GST cut.

‚ÄúIt is not a permanent demand. We know GST is such a huge developmental agenda for the government, but at the same time (it is needed for) reviving the auto industry. We (auto industry) are almost 8% of the GDP and 49% of manufacturing GDP,‚Äù Kale said.

He said while the revival of monsoon holds out hope, resolution of liquidity crisis, specially with the NBFCs, will go along way in helping the auto industry recover from one of the worst sales slumps in its history."
48,Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking,"Question of livelihood and the lived reality of people, sooner or later, catch up with any democratically-elected government.

One of the major promises on which the 2014 elections were won was massive job creation. Even after its stunning victory in 2019, primarily fought on the national security plank, among the first things the new Narendra Modi government did was to set up a cabinet committee to create jobs.

Clearly, the sensitivity of the livelihood issue is recognised and likely to be taken up by the opposition in coming days, with the potential of quickly altering opinions.

In fact, there was wide speculation after the resignation of the chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) that the employment data, showing the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, was willfully suppressed.

Finally, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data was made public on May 31, 2019. What does it show?

Key takeaways

Preliminary analysis of PLFS data shows that the most striking news ‚Äì for the first time in 45 years, ever since NSS have been conducted ‚Äì is the contraction of aggregate employment by 1.2 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18 (Table 1).

Aggregate employment, which stood at 472.5 million in 2011-12, came down to 471.3 million in 2017-18. This is primarily driven by rural women losing 24.7 million jobs ‚Äî other segments of the workforce however saw net addition to jobs.

Table 1: Aggregate change in employment (million) Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker Total worker 2017-18 239.0 77.0 123.8 31.5 471.3 2011-12 234.4 101.6 109.1 27.4 472.5 Net change 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

The decline in the rural female workforce is not new ‚Äì this has been happening for quite some time now. In the earlier period, between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the female workforce in rural areas shrank ‚Äì although the magnitude of the decline was less than in the current period ‚Äì by 21.8 million (Table 2).

The other big takeaway from PLFS data is the close to a fourfold slowdown in employment creation for rural males. Thus, the jobs crisis prominently visible in the previous period in rural female segment seems to have spread to the rural male segment now ‚Äì as employment in the latter segment merely increased by 4.6 million in the current period, compared to 16.8 million in the previous one ‚Äì engulfing the whole rural economy.

Hence, much more is needed than simple cash transfer schemes, increasing MSPs periodically or debt reliefs. Public investment in agriculture along with energising MGNREGS (to help create rural infrastructure), among others, should be on the cards.

Moreover, the pace of employment expansion for urban males also decelerated in the recent period (14.7 million) compared to the previous one (17.6 million). It is only in the urban female segment that employment growth picked up, registering 4.1 million increase compared to 2.1 million in the previous period.

Sectoral distribution

There is another way of looking at the employment debacle. It is to look at the sectoral distribution of employment. With the majority of rural persons still engaged in agriculture, a crisis in the rural economy most prominently manifests itself in agricultural employment. People in large numbers (27.1 million) deserted agriculture between 2011-12 and 2017-18, once again led by rural female workers (19.8 million) (Table 3).

This decline in agricultural employment is visible across every segment of the workforce, except urban males. Therefore, the much-discussed unremunerative returns from agriculture are confirmed by the latest data. People are seen to be leaving agriculture, primarily due to push factors, for there was inadequate absorption in non-agricultural sectors of the economy (25.9 million). Precisely, due to this reason ‚Äì more people abandoning agriculture than the available non-agricultural jobs ‚Äì aggregate employment has shrunk.

Table 3 also shows the struggles faced by the ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô programme and the futility of enormous money spent on imparting skills, as these were primarily targeted at boosting manufacturing employment. Overall, manufacturing employment growth turned negative (0.9 million) and benefits of ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô programme seem to have bypassed every section of the workforce, except urban males.

Thus, a comprehensive well-calibrated manufacturing policy focusing on the labour-intensive sectors seems to be the need of the hour. The construction sector, which is widely viewed as the employer of last resort in the previous period, barely managed to absorb 4.6 million new workers in the current period. How does this compare with the previous period?

Table 3: Employment change in major sectors: 2017-18 over 2011-12 (million) Major sectors Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker All workers Agriculture -7.8 -19.8 0.6 -0.1 -27.1 Manufacturing -0.6 -3.7 3.3 0.1 -0.9 Construction 4.2 -2.6 2.8 0.2 4.6 Non-agricultural 12.4 -4.9 14.2 4.3 25.9 Total 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

Table 4 compares the capacity of labour absorption in key sectors of the economy over two periods. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the construction sector added 24 million jobs, becoming the largest sector of the economy in terms of job creation.

Thus, compared to the previous period, there is more than fivefold deceleration in job growth in the construction sector. The manufacturing sector absorbed 5.3 million workers in the earlier period, which posted negative growth in the present period mentioned above.

Table 4: Comparing sectoral employment change with the earlier period (million) Time period Agriculture Manufacturing Construction Non-agricultural Total 2017-18 over 2011-12 -27.1 -0.9 4.6 25.9 -1.2 2011-12 over 2004-05 -34.4 5.3 24 48.9 14.6

Slowdown in non-agricultural jobs

The alarming situation in the aggregate labour market can also be comprehended from the slowdown in non-agricultural job growth. Notice from Table 4, a larger number of people moved out of agriculture (34.4 million) between 2004-05 and 2011-12, compared to the recent period (27.1 million) ‚Äì2011-12 and 2017-18.

However, aggregate employment still expanded by 14.6 million in the previous period, while in the present period, we already noted that employment shrunk by 1.2 million. This is simply because labour absorption in non-agriculture almost halved in the current period; while employment in non-agriculture expanded by 48.9 million in the previous period, presently it could only absorb 25.9 million fresh workers.

Thus, there is an urgent necessity to revive non-agricultural employment alongside supporting agriculture.

Finally, on the issue of comparability of PLFS with earlier NSS rounds. First, P.C. Mohanan, who resigned as NSC chairman, categorically mentioned: ‚ÄúWhen we [National Statistical Commission] approve a report, I am not going to give a figure which is not comparable with the other ones. Second, the concept of employment and unemployment are universally accepted. International Labour Organization prescribes the standards, we all follow it.‚Äù

Second, professor R. Ramakumar pointed out that the sampling design only changed at a later stage (second stage stratification) and there are inbuilt mechanisms to correct over/under-representation of any group.

Finally, by saying underemployment rates are not comparable with earlier rounds due to educational factors, it is implicitly argued that those looking for jobs but unable to find it are voluntarily unemployed. It is a cruel joke on those unable to find work, given the employment situation described above, when traditional sectors of the economy are shedding/inadequately absorbing labour and modern sectors are incapable of accommodating them (including the educated). Instead of denying the jobs crisis, it should be tackled head-on, for any government neglecting these facts does so at its own peril.
