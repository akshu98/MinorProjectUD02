0,"Comprehensive employment, industrial policies are necessary to address jobs crisis","since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image) since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. (Representational Image)

A report in this paper (IE, November 1) on various employment estimates for 2017-18, based on the PLFS (periodic labour force survey) data, has received considerable attention. We have received several queries from policy makers regarding the differences in our employment estimates with studies by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey (BD), and Himanshu that are quoted in the report. In this article, we clarify the reasons for the differences and highlight the major findings of our study.

First, our estimates are different from that of BD because theirs are based only on the usual principal status (UPS) of employment. Our study is based on both usual principal and subsidiary status (UPSS) of employment. Since Himanshu‚Äôs estimates are also based on UPSS, our figures are not much different except for the 2017-18 PLFS figures. Himanshu‚Äôs and our estimates for employment in both 2004-05 and 2011-12 are almost the same (the negligible difference is because of the use of population multipliers that differ at second and third decimal points). The discrepancy with Himanshu‚Äôs 2017-18 employment figure is only because he probably used a lower population multiplier based on a projected total population of 1.33 billion.

But, while comparing Himanshu‚Äôs estimates with that of BD for 2017-18, we find that both their figures are the same (this is surprising since BD have ignored the subsidiary status of employment unlike Himanshu). We have explored why this has happened. BD have used a projected population of close to 1.36 billion based on their argument that the annual population growth of India was about 1.7 per cent between 2011-12 and 2017-18. This is a very high overestimation of India‚Äôs population growth rate during this period. The World Bank‚Äôs population projection (available at World Development Indicators) shows that annual population growth in India was only 1.2 per cent per annum in 2012 and 1.04 per cent in 2018, and the total population was about 1.34 billion in 2017-18. Our population projections (based on a monthly exponential growth rate) show that the total population in India was about 1.345 billion in 2017-18 (the same as the World Bank‚Äôs estimate).

The National Family Health Survey 2015-16 shows that there has been a phenomenal decline in the total fertility rate (the number of children born to women in the reproductive age group of 15-49), reaching a near replacement rate of 2.2 per woman, from 2.7 in 2005-06. Hence, the 1.06 per cent population growth rate we use is logical; and 1.7 per cent cannot be India‚Äôs current population growth rate. The use of the latter artificially raises the workforce number that BD came up with, 457 million in 2017-18. This is surprising since they had missed out on subsidiary workers altogether. Hence, they fail to find that the total jobs in India fell by nine million in six years, a first in India‚Äôs history.

Moreover, since the employment and unemployment figures are always estimated considering both the principal and subsidiary status of employment, BD‚Äôs employment estimate, based only on the principal status, is incomplete and misleading. The principal employment status is recorded for a relatively longer duration of time in the survey year (normally for a period of six months and more). It leaves out those who work for less than six months, and who must also be counted among those working. The subsidiary status of employment data (covering those working 30 days but less than 182 days), covers those not employed in the principal status, and must be added to workers in principal status. So, by ignoring the subsidiary employment, BD provide an incomplete and incorrect employment trend for India.

Hence, BD‚Äôs claim that manufacturing employment during 2011-12 and 2017-18 was ‚Äústagnant‚Äù is also misleading. In fact, based on the UPSS, we found that manufacturing employment actually declined by three million between 2011-2012 and 2017-2018. While labour intensive sub-sectors were mainly responsible for this decline, a few capital intensive manufacturing sub-sectors did register consistent growth of jobs during 2004-05 and 2017-2018. Although the quality of jobs is very poor in the services sector, it has played a major role in driving job growth, but only partly offsetting the fall in employment in agriculture, manufacturing, and slowing employment creation in the construction sector. In fact, because of their problematic methodology, BD fail to notice the actual fall in total employment (including self-employment of the Ola/Uber or Mudra variety, which is captured in a comprehensive sample of the unorganised and organised sector workers).

The share of regular and formal employment increased marginally due to growth of formal jobs in the private sector, but the share of informal jobs (without social security) within the government/public sector has increased. A dominant and rising share of jobs is still generated by micro and small units in the unorganised sectors without any formal or written job contract. In both government and private sectors, the number of contract jobs (with no written contract, or less than a year‚Äôs contract, or one to three-years contract) is on the rise post 2011-12. Although BD‚Äôs paper also reveals the same story, we differ from them on the absolute number of jobs. The rate of growth of jobs in the unorganised component is much higher than in the organised sector (those with more than 10 workers).

Moreover, BD‚Äôs research also provides a partial picture of the unemployment trends in India as they could not capture the upsurge in open unemployment among educated youth (which has more than doubled in a matter of six years), nor the recent rise in the disheartened youth labour force (those in the age group of 15-29 and not in educational institutions or the labour force). We found that the number of disheartened youth (having secondary and above level of general education, and with technical and vocational qualifications) is rising at an alarming rate.

With total jobs falling at a time when new entrants into the labour force are increasing at an accelerating pace, it is not surprising that real wages have not increased in both rural and urban areas. From now on, entrants into the labour force will increase at an accelerating pace, at least until 2030. Hence, a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy (to boost growth of medium and large firms) is necessary to address the transformation of agrarian workforce, boost real wages, and to ensure industrial development.

1,Explained: Is the push towards organised manufacturing the answer to India‚Äôs jobs crisis?,"For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector. For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

In any Budget, there are essentially two main questions that need to be answered. One, what is the outlook on boosting economic growth. Two, what is the status of the fiscal health of the government ‚Äî that is, what is the level of fiscal deficit etc.

This year, however, there is another big question: What can the government do to boost employment in the country.

In the past year, there have been several reports, both official and by independent academics, that have painted a bleak picture on the jobs front. For instance, a 2017-18 National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) survey pegged unemployment at a 45-year high. Other researchers like Mehrotra & Parida as well as Himanshu have shown how the absolute number of ‚Äúemployed‚Äù people witnessed a decline between 2012 and 2018.

For a while now, it has been suggested that India‚Äôs unemployment woes can only be solved by boosting the manufacturing sector.

Why manufacturing?

It has been argued that between the three broad sectors of the economy ‚Äî agriculture, industry and services ‚Äî it is the industry sector, and within industry, the manufacturing sector that has the highest potential to absorb the surplus labour in the economy.

Agriculture, which engages almost half the Indian workforce, does not grow fast enough and is, as such, not remunerative enough to provide gainful employment to the millions who join India‚Äôs workforce each year. It is for this reason why more and more people have left agriculture and tried to join other sectors of the economy since 2004.

Services is a fast-growing sector and pays well but it places far greater demands on job seekers in terms of skills and education. Often, the rural millions looking for a job find themselves inadequate in terms of delivering in the services sector ‚Äî not without skills education at least.

That leaves the industry, which includes sub-sectors like manufacturing and non-manufacturing (that is, construction and mining etc.). Research shows that the employment elasticity ‚Äî the ability to create new jobs with every additional increase in a sector‚Äôs growth ‚Äî of the manufacturing sector is the highest.

Explaining the Budget, Part-1: How the Union Budget is prepared

What did the past governments do?

For a while now, both UPA and NDA governments have tried to focus on boosting the growth in the manufacturing sector. For instance, in 2011, Congress-led UPA came out with a new National Manufacturing Policy that aimed at raising the share of the manufacturing sector to 25% of the GDP by 2022. The BJP-led NDA too unveiled the Make in India initiative that focussed using manufacturing as the main platform to create jobs.

Each Union Budget tends to focus on measures that will promote manufacturing ‚Äî both big- and small-scale ‚Äî and create jobs.

However, despite such a focussed stand right through the past decade, manufacturing‚Äôs share is still under 17% of the GDP and the jobs situation in the country has only got worse.

What does the data show?

An analysis of the Indian manufacturing sector done by India Ratings shows that manufacturing units in the organised sector are becoming more capital intensive ‚Äî that is the capital-to-labour ratio is increasing. In other words, instead of increasing the number of workers in a unit, owners are choosing to increase the amount of capital.

As Table 1 shows, the trend is of a secular increase over the years. What is worse is that this trend holds true across the board including those sectors such as textiles and leather products that are considered ‚Äúlabour-intensive‚Äù and most capable of creating jobs and soaking up surplus labour (see Tables 2 and 3).

The oddest bit in this trend is that owners of these manufacturing units appear to be increasingly substituting labour with capital even when the return on capital is falling. Data shows that in the organised manufacturing sector profit per unit of capital invested has fallen sharply between 2007-08 and 2017-18.

The flip side of this picture is the decline in India‚Äôs labour productivity growth rate ‚Äî see Table 4

Not surprisingly, this trend of falling labour productivity growth in organised manufacturing has also gone along with a decline in wage growth ‚Äî Table 5

Yet again, this trend of decline in wage growth is largely secular across the board and includes sectors like textiles and leather that could create the maximum jobs.

Explaining the Budget, Part-2: What ails the credibility of India‚Äôs Budget numbers

What is the upshot?

The data shows that in organised manufacturing ‚Äî that is, manufacturing done in the formal sector where workers are covered under labour laws etc. ‚Äî labour productivity growth and wages growth are declining and businesses are increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital.

This raises several questions for policymakers:

1> Why are manufacturing owners increasingly preferring to substitute labour with capital? It is important to note that they continue to do so even when the return on capital is falling.

2> If this is the trend, how reasonable is it to assume that boosting manufacturing growth will create more jobs for the Indian youth?

3> The government has been increasingly pushing for ‚Äúorganised‚Äù or formal sector manufacturing but if this trend is anything to go by, is such a push justified?

4> What is the extent to which the lack of significant labour reform is holding back manufacturing from achieving its potential to create jobs?

When Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman stands up to present the Budget on February 1, these are some of the issues she could be expected to address when discussing the growing question mark on unemployment in India.

2,It‚Äôs a wage crisis,"At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high.

The debate around unemployment is unhelpful ‚Äî since 1947, unemployment has bounced between 3-7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force. But reconciling this mathematical accuracy with our painful poverty ‚Äî it has bounced between 25-75 per cent of our population since 1947, based on your definition of needs, wants and desires ‚Äî needs an understanding of the ‚Äúself-exploitation‚Äù theory proposed by the Russian economist Alexander Chayanov in the 1920s. He convinced Jawaharlal Nehru that small farms are viable because you don‚Äôt have to pay yourself rent or pay a salary to yourself, spouse or kids. I make the case that one, self-exploitation ‚Äî hanging out vella (idle) with low or zero marginal productivity in farms, self-employment or subsistence wage employment ‚Äî has been India‚Äôs labour market shock absorber since 1947. Two, this shock absorber no longer works because Indians born after 1991 expect a living wage (that meets aspirations) rather than a minimum wage (that keeps mind and body together). And three, these higher wage expectations can only be met by transitioning people to higher productivity sectors, geographies, and firms.

Our current debate confuses jobs with wages. Almost every Indian who wants a job has a job but they don‚Äôt get the wages they want or need because they work in unviable sectors (48 per cent of our labour force on farms generates only 13 per cent of the GDP), unviable firms (our 6.3 crore enterprises only translate to 19,500 companies with a paid-up capital greater than Rs 10 crore), unviable entrepreneurship (50 per cent of our labour force is not self-employed but self-exploiting), and unviable geographies (2 lakh of our 6 lakh villages have less than 200 people).

Historian Ramachandra Guha reminds us that India may not yet be the most important or powerful country in the world but it is surely the most interesting. Our political parties have created the world‚Äôs largest democracy on the infertile soil of the world‚Äôs most hierarchical society. But we had zero chances of creating the world‚Äôs largest economy on the infertile soil of the economic model articulated by the Avadi Resolution of 1955 and the Second Five Year plan of 1956. High wages need a complex ecosystem of high productivity firms and individuals: IT firms employ only 0.7 per cent of India‚Äôs labour force but produce 7 per cent of India‚Äôs GDP. A waiter in Chicago with skills similar to a waiter in Jaipur makes 20 times higher wages because of the productivity of the customers eating at the restaurant, and India‚Äôs 20 million manufacturing SME‚Äôs have at least 25 times lower productivity than Germany‚Äôs 200,000 mittelstand (SMEs).

Essentially, the GDP of 114 million Maharashtrians is more than 204 million people in Uttar Pradesh because Maharashtra is more formalised, industrialised, financialised, urbanised and skilled. Similarly, the GDP of 1.2 billion Indians till 2019 was lower than 66 million Britons because socialism ‚Äî capitalism without competition and bankruptcy ‚Äî led to nutty economics after 1947. Three books ‚Äî Capitalism in America; A History by Alan Greenspan and Adrian Wooldridge, How China Escaped the Poverty Trap by Yuen Yuen Ang, and Lost Glory; India‚Äôs Capitalism Story by Sumit Majumdar ‚Äî talk about choices and consequences. America amplified prosperity (35 per cent of people in official poverty have air-conditioning and 60 per cent have a car), China has used markets to move 700 million people out of poverty since 1978, while our licence-raj bred inefficiency. Politician Vasant Sathe pointed out in the 1980s that India‚Äôs public sector steel industry employed 10 times more people to produce half the steel of South Koreans.

But India is breaking with its past. We have six million new registered enterprises after GST and 30 million new social security payers in three years. Our new monetary policy committee and fiscal discipline have blunted inflation from 8.33 per cent in 2014 to 2.19 per cent. Our new bankruptcy law has started recycling assets of Rs 14 lakh crore. In the 1960s, the-then RBI governor L K Jha had presciently warned that resource utilisation is as important as resource mobilisation. Digital payments have exploded from 0.1 million the month before demonetisation to 650 million last month. Infrastructure spending has doubled in the last five years accompanied by qualitative improvements in air connectivity, ports, highways and railways. Finally, a modern state is a welfare state with a broad tax base; India has more than a crore new individual tax filers since demonetisation with a 45 per cent increase in returns with incomes below Rs 10 lakh last year.

For India‚Äôs 25th birthday in 1972, the late Sheila Dhar wrote a wonderful book, This India that suggested, ‚ÄúIndians have great patience. It is not in their nature to be in a hurry. They can wait longer, suffer more and work harder than other people.‚Äù This paragraph would probably change for the 75th birthday version in 2022; the impatience of our young is changing India and her politics. And thankfully, our democracy means that the Chinese communist party strategy articulated in the 1980s ‚Äî fill their stomachs but empty their minds ‚Äî will not work in India. India‚Äôs youth don‚Äôt aspire to replace self-exploitation with the patronising pessimism of loan-write offs, subsidies or income without work; they recognise that a hard day‚Äôs work in a formal job provides dignity, strength, identity and purpose in addition to living wages.

At a deeper level, our acceptance of self-exploitation was a form of mental bondage that defied Rabindranath Tagore‚Äôs dream of our country becoming a place where the mind is without fear and the head is held high. In 1910, Tagore articulated this vision in ‚ÄòChitto Jetha Bhoyshunno‚Äô hoping his country would awake to a freedom where tireless striving stretches its arms to perfection. The end of our acceptance of self-exploitation embodies a freedom that would please the great sentinel. India‚Äôs challenge is not jobs but employed poverty and while there is much unfinished work, it‚Äôs delusional to believe we aren‚Äôt making good progress. And it is unhelpful presentism to believe that policy-makers have no choice other than viewing our youth as petitioners rather than potential apprentices.

3,The rising insecurity,"Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector.

There are several pointers to the jobs crisis in India: One, the number of workers in the age-group of 18-30 employed under the MGNREGA rose to 7.07 million in 2018-19, up from 5.8 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî signaling the lack of employment opportunities. Two, a study commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister says that even in the organised sector in India there was a preference in favour of ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs between 2011-12 and 2017-18. Thus, not only are enough employment opportunities not being created for the millions entering the labour market and for those shifting out of agriculture, but even the jobs that are being added are of the ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù kind, calling into question the quality of jobs created.

Much of the labour force shifting out of agriculture between 2004-05 and 2011-12 found its way into the construction sector. But with the sector in the midst of a multi-year slowdown, employment opportunities are likely to have severely diminished. It is thus possible that the slowdown in economic activity, especially in the non-farm labour intensive sectors in both rural and urban areas, coupled with the terms of trade shifting against agriculture, would have pushed workers to seek employment under the employment guarantee scheme. The NSSO PLFS report also shows that youth unemployment (age group of 15 to 29) surged from 6.1 per cent in 2011-12 to 17.8 per cent in 2017-18, indicating that not enough employment opportunities exist. This slack in the labour market also reflects in the subdued wage growth. On the other hand, the jobs report indicates a shift towards informalisation of work relations even in the organised sector during this period. And as these ‚Äúnon-contractual‚Äù jobs are unlikely to provide any form of social security benefits, it raises questions over the quality of these jobs.

The Mudra programme was meant to help tackle the jobs crisis in India. As reported in this paper, Rs 5.71 lakh crore was sanctioned during the first three years of this programme through 12.27 crore loan accounts. Yet, only 1.12 crore additional jobs were created during this period, implying that every new loan did not create an additional employment opportunity. This inability to create enough quality jobs will have long-term repercussions for the Indian economy. India is in the midst of a demographic transition, but the data so far suggests that it has not been able to take advantage of it.

4,"With India facing a job crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms","Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File) Amazon to invest USD 1 bn in digitising Indian SMBs: Jeff Bezos (File)

Since he began his second term as Prime Minister, Narendra Modi has talked of many things. Nationalism, Kashmir, citizenship, Pakistan, patriotism, treacherous Congress leaders. The one thing he seems to avoid talking about is the economy. Is this because he knows that the economy is in worse shape now than when he first became Prime Minister? Is this because as an astute politician he has noticed that much of the unrest we have seen on campuses across India is because India‚Äôs young people are beginning to feel a sense of hopelessness? A terrifying realisation that no matter how hard they work at their studies they could remain jobless for years?

Wherever I go these days I meet educated young Indians, many of whom voted for Modi, who admit that the thought of the future frightens them. They wear jeans, carry mobile phones and cut their hair in the latest fashion and almost the first thing they say to me is that they would be grateful if I could help them find a job. Not a government job. Just one that does not involve menial work. Even a street child I have helped with her education wants to be a fashion designer.

If for no other reason than that India faces an unemployment crisis, we should have welcomed Jeff Bezos with open arms last week. He tried his best to assure Modi and his ministers that he came bearing the gift of creating a million new jobs by 2025. Wearing an Indian waistcoat and radiating hope and goodwill, the world‚Äôs richest man declared that he was sure that the 21st century would be India‚Äôs century. But, instead of being welcomed, he was insulted publicly by Modi‚Äôs Minister of Commerce who told him that he did India no ‚Äúfavours‚Äù by offering to invest a billion dollars. ‚ÄúThey (Amazon) may have put in a billion dollars, but then, if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year, then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,‚Äù said Piyush Goyal. If this was not rude enough, there was more to come. A senior BJP official intervened to tweet that Bezos order his newspaper, The Washington Post, to start writing nice things about the Modi government if he wanted to do business here.

The Prime Minister himself is so sensitive about the sullying of his image abroad by ‚Äòliberal‚Äô newspapers that he found no time to grant Bezos an audience. An odd decision if you consider that he travels to distant lands regularly to urge investors to come ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô. Amazon is already, in its fashion, making in India. In rural India, Amazon has become almost a synonym for online shopping. Many of the unemployed youths I run into on my travels regularly go to it to buy everything from small household goods to books. Since in my own case I restrict my online shopping to books, I am constantly startled by the range of goods that young Indians are buying on Amazon. Insulting Bezos was in my view a mistake on the part of the Modi government.

Another mistake that the Prime Minister needs to pay much more attention to is his neglect of the economy in pursuit of political goals like abrogating Article 370 and passing that amendment to the citizenship law that has caused so much misgiving and mistrust. Both the Prime Minister and his Finance Minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, have repeatedly urged Indian businessmen to invest without fear, but if this has not begun to happen, it is on account of misgiving and mistrust. The mission to ‚Äòeradicate‚Äô black money that began with demonetisation has given so much power to petty officials that they have all started to behave with the same obnoxious officiousness they displayed in bad old socialist times when the Licence Raj was alive and dominant. I live in Mumbai and can report that in recent months I have not met a single businessman, big or small, who has said that business was good.

What should worry the Prime Minister more is that most people blame him for what has gone wrong, whether it is businessmen, shopkeepers or jobless youth. In one voice they say that they voted for Modi not once but twice in the hope that he would concentrate on reviving the economy. When I ask if they are not pleased that such big political reforms as the abrogation of Article 370 have happened, they admit that they are not displeased. But that what they want more is for the economy to start showing signs of real recovery. It is in Modi‚Äôs hands to control the uncertainty that is caused by the endless new rules and regulations that his officials have come up with. But it is in the hands of men like Bezos to create the millions of jobs that young Indians desperately need.

5,The problem of skilling India,"The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar) The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough.(Illustration by CR Sasikumar)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his recent Independence Day speech, said, ‚ÄúWe need to worry about population explosion‚Äù. These words stand in stark contrast to his previous references to India‚Äôs demographic dividend where the country‚Äôs population was seen as an asset. This shift reflects a new awareness, according to which demography brings a dividend only if the youth is trained properly. Without proper training, instead of benefits, the country gets massive joblessness ‚Äî at least, this is what common sense suggests. Reality is more complicated.

A minimum of eight million new job seekers enter the jobs market every year. In 2017, only 5.5 million had been created, and the situation is worsening: Unemployment rate is the highest in 45 years today. The Indian youth has become the first casualty, with the unemployment rate reaching 34 per cent among the 20-24-year-olds in the first quarter of 2019 ‚Äî it was 37.9 per cent among the urban lot, according to the CMIE. Official sources from the government of India do not give very different data: According to the last 2018 Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), the unemployment rate among the urban 15-29-year-olds (a very large bracket) was 23.7 per cent. One may hypothesise that this pervasive joblessness was due to the poor training of the youth as only seven per cent of the people surveyed in the framework of the PLFS declared any formal or informal training.

But there is a paradox here: According to a recent survey, 48 per cent of Indian employers reported difficulties filling job vacancies due to talent shortage. The worst affected sector ‚Äî which is also one of the strong points of India‚Äôs economy ‚Äî has been Information Technology (IT), where 1,40,000 skilled techies could not be recruited in 2018 despite the employers‚Äô efforts (a high proportion of the 5,00,000 job offers that had been made that year). Indeed, the CMIE reports show that the more educated Indians are, the more likely they are to remain unemployed too. The last PLFS for 2018 revealed that 33 per cent of the formally trained 15-29-year-olds were jobless.

The Modi government assumed that this problem crystallised because the trained youth were not well-trained enough. Hence, the ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù programme, whose objective was ‚Äúto train a minimum of 300 million skilled people by the year 2022‚Äù. In 2014, Modi created a Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship to harmonise training processes, assessments, certification and outcomes and, crucially, to develop Industrial Training Institutions (ITIs) ‚Äî the building blocks of this endeavour. The Executive Committee monitoring the mission gathered representatives of nine ministries, as vocational training was seen at the intersection of different domains, including agriculture, information technology, human resources development.

Modi, who chaired the governing council and announced the setting up of 1,500 new ITIs and 50,000 Skill Development Centres, committed himself to ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù in eloquent terms: ‚ÄúToday, the world and India need a skilled workforce. I also want to create a pool of young people who are able to create jobs. My brothers and sisters, having taken a resolve to enhance the skill development at a highly rapid pace, I want to accomplish this‚Äù.

Clearly, Modi saw ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù as a plan complementary to another flagship scheme he launched in 2014 ‚Äî ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù, a policy inviting foreign investors, and, as a way to train entrepreneurs (as evident from the name of the ministry in charge of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù).

Besides the creation of more courses and institutes of vocational training, the main innovation of ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù consisted in integrating ‚Äúvocational training classes linked to the local economy‚Äù with formal education from class nine onwards in at least 25 per cent of the schools and higher education bodies. A very important aspect of Skill India was its PPP character: Companies were requested to ‚Äúearmark 2 per cent of their payroll bill (including for contract labour) for skill development initiatives‚Äù. In parallel, the ITIs were supposed to ‚Äútie up with industry in the relevant trades to improve placement opportunities for candidates‚Äù.

One of the most innovative dimensions of Skill India was the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana under which the training fees was paid by the government. The PMKVY‚Äôs budget was approximately Rs 12,000 crore for four years (2016-2020). Its main tool was the ‚Äúshort-term training‚Äù, which could last between 150 and 300 hours, and which included some placement assistance by Training Partners upon successful completion of their assessment by the candidates.

While the intentions of Skill India are commendable, the scheme falls short of the initial objectives. The target of this scheme was to reach out to 300 million young people by 2022, but only a mere 25 million had been trained under this scheme by the end of 2018. Partly due to mismanagement and partly due to the fact that funds available for ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù were either not spent sufficiently quickly ‚Äî because of a lack of candidates ‚Äî or too little was spent. The money problem is evident from the graph and from the PLF Survey mentioned above which showed that, in 2018, only 16 per cent of the youth who had received ‚Äúformal training were funded by the government‚Äù.

But the real problem lies elsewhere: Those who have been trained don‚Äôt find jobs. The number of those who have benefited from the Skill India scheme has increased, from 3,50,000 in 2016-17 to 1.6 million in 2017-18, but the percentage of those who could find a job upon completion of their training has dropped from more than 50 per cent to 30 per cent. If one focuses only on the PMKVY, the results are even more disappointing. Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha in March 2018, the then minister for skill development, Dharmendra Pradhan, told the House that in the framework of this programme 4.13 million people had been trained, but only 6,15,000 (15 per cent) of them got a job.

These limitations may be explained from three points of view.

First, the training was not good enough ‚Äì and this is why the employability rate remains very low. Second, while the government expected that some of the PMKVY-trainees would create their own enterprise, only 24 per cent of the 6,15,000 mentioned above started their business. And out of them, only 10,000 applied for MUDRA loans ‚Äîa drop in the ocean. Third, and more importantly, India‚Äôs joblessness issue is not only a skills problem, it is representative of the lack of appetite of industrialists and SMEs for recruiting. The decline of the investment rate is a clear indication that the demand is weak ‚Äîhence huge idle capacities ‚Äî and investing is not an easy thing to do anyway because of the limited access to credit that the accumulation of Non-Performing Assets has generated.

Skill India will not be enough to create jobs if the slowdown continues. But in the long run, Skill India will also not be enough if government expenditures in education remain low and if, therefore, the ground isn‚Äôt prepared for proper training. In fact, under the Modi government, allocation for school education has declined from 2.81 per cent of the budget in 2013-14 to 2.05 per cent in 2018-19. It was above 3 per cent during UPA II.

6,A problem of measurement,"We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar) We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. (Illustratiion: C R Sasikumar)

Modi 2.0 presents a new window of opportunity to usher in some fundamental reforms for the Indian economy. A modern dynamic economy requires a robust statistical system to provide precise and real time estimates of several critical indicators. One of these is unemployment ‚Äî which has been at the heart of prolonged acrimonious public debate in India for several years. Now is the time to move beyond the politics of unemployment to the real and pressing issue of measurement of unemployment. In 2016-17, the government of India, quite rightly so, was of the view that the existing frequency of measuring key unemployment and employment indicators was not adequate for the design of economic policies. There was a need for more timely and periodic measures ‚Äî a quarterly estimate in urban areas and an annual estimate in rural areas ‚Äî the ‚ÄúPeriodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS)‚Äù. A committee of senior bureaucrats, economists and business leaders was constituted to look into this and an all-India PLFS survey was undertaken.

The results of this survey have not been officially released. However, the leaked reports of an historically high unemployment rate and the subsequent resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), who were involved with the PLFS, created a furore and heightened the politicisation of unemployment. The Opposition used this as an opportunity to malign the government, while the government representatives at NITI Aayog resorted to the view that the survey results have not been reviewed by experts, and therefore the report was not deemed reliable enough to be released. The truth of the matter, however, is that there is neither credible evidence of a job crisis in India, nor credible evidence of the absence of it. The problem requires a serious effort by the government to address issues of measurement. In this essay, I will outline what the government needs to do in this regard.

First, measurement of economic indicators, for example the unemployment rate, is an apolitical issue that requires statistical expertise of the highest standards. Before the release of any figure, it is imperative to discuss, debate and deliberate the methodological issues around the measurement. For example, to measure the unemployment rate, it is practically impossible to conduct a periodic census of all citizens above 15 years. Therefore, we have to rely on the second-best option of conducting sample surveys, and the natural question is then about the size of the sample survey. The sample size critically depends on the question of interest, for example, the sample size in the US is determined ‚Äúon the requirement that a difference of 0.2 percentage points in the unemployment rate for two consecutive months be statistically significant at the 0.10 level‚Äù. If the objective of the PLFS was to measure changes in unemployment from quarter-to-quarter in urban areas and year-to-year in rural areas, then we need to discuss sampling precisely to gauge these estimates. Therefore, there can be no credible discussion on changes in unemployment from one period to another in the absence of a paper that outlines in detail the underlying sampling methodology. Proprietary databases like the CMIE, which claim to estimate these time trends, have marketed themselves with a complete absence of such methodological requirements, and are hence non-credible.

Second, even if the sample size issue is addressed to minimise what statisticians call sampling errors (the sample size might not be large enough to address the question of interest), there are issues relating to non-sampling errors. This includes non-participation in the survey or refusal to answer some questions or misunderstanding of survey questions. Each of these are important issues and needs to be addressed in the methodology. For example, suppose there is a job boom in the economy and the employed overwhelmingly refuse to participate in such surveys or do not answer all questions, then it is possible for the survey to indicate high unemployment. Therefore, non-participation is an important issue and methodological rigour requires for a survey to have transparent strategies to prevent or minimise these errors.

Third, India is a large, complex and diverse economy that is undergoing structural transformation. Hence, we are moving towards precision policy-making which requires local and real time socio-economic indicators. We know that the nature and incidence of unemployment, for example, differs from state to state. This requires local measures of unemployment so that economic policies can be tailored depending on local conditions. For instance, unemployment is a rural phenomenon in several states, while in others it is concentrated in urban areas. The state governments will have to participate along with the central government to have comparable uniform measures of periodic unemployment. This requires state governments to conduct periodic surveys on the same lines as the central government. Unfortunately, at present, several state governments do not have the capacity to conduct such regular surveys. This, however, is imperative for a large dynamic economy such as ours. Robust statistical systems will require that we begin to create such local capabilities urgently. It is time to move beyond one-size-fits-all solutions to more inclusive solutions that take into account local conditions.

In the end, one cannot help but recall eminent statistician John W Tukey‚Äôs words in 1949: ‚ÄúIt is far easier to put out a figure than to accompany it with a wise and reasoned account of its liability to systematic and fluctuating errors. Yet if the figure is to serve as the basis of an important decision, the accompanying account may be more important than the figure itself.‚Äù

To enhance India‚Äôs statistical capabilities, we have to move beyond the politics of it and focus on measuring with precision. Timely estimates are the cornerstones of policy-making in a modern dynamic and an aspirational economy like ours.

7,"Six-year low ‚Äî and slow: GDP growth recorded at 4.5 per cent, lowest in more than 6 years","Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed. Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Dragged down by a contraction in manufacturing, weak investment, and lower consumption demand, India‚Äôs GDP growth rate at 4.5 per cent for Q2, 2019-20, hit a 26-quarter low in July-September, data released by National Statistical Office Friday showed.

This is the lowest quarterly growth rate in the five-and-half years of the Narendra Modi-led NDA government. The previous low was 4.3 per cent during January-March 2012-13.

READ | GDP growth at 4.5 per cent: Manmohan flags fear, India Inc‚Äôs silence on slowdown is telling

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), scheduled to announce its bi-monthly monetary policy statement on December 5, is expected to continue its accommodative monetary policy stance with another repo rate cut to support growth.

Growth rate in terms of Gross Value Added (GVA), which is GDP minus net product taxes and reflects supply-side growth, has slowed to 4.3 per cent in July-September as against 6.9 per cent a year ago. With this, GDP growth rate for April-September, the first half of this fiscal, is now at 4.8 per cent as against 7.5 per cent growth in the year-ago period.

The growth rate has now slowed for the sixth consecutive quarter, declining by 3.6 percentage points during this period.

The nominal GDP growth rate, which accounts for inflation, slowed further from the first quarter to 6.1 per cent in July-September from double-digit level of 12 per cent in the corresponding period last year.

Investment, as measured by gross fixed capital formation, that has been slowing for the last two quarters, grew just 1 per cent in July-September, the data showed.

Manufacturing growth contracted 1 per cent as against 6.9 per cent growth last year during the same quarter, while the ‚Äúagriculture, forestry and fishing‚Äù sector recorded a growth rate of 2.1 per cent as against 4.9 per cent last year. GVA growth for the construction sector also slowed to 3.3 per cent in July-September from 8.5 per cent year ago.

Most economists had expected GDP growth rate for the second quarter to slip to sub-5 per cent level with projections hovering in the 4.2-4.7 per cent range.

At 4.5 per cent, the GDP growth is much lower than 5.3 per cent projected for July-September by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its October policy. For the country to clock a growth rate of even 5 per cent for the full 2019-20 financial year, the economy would now have to grow at least 5.2 per cent in the remaining two quarters of this financial year.

Economists said without the support of higher government expenditure, GDP growth would have been even much lower, with most high frequency data such as non-food credit growth, auto sales and select fast-moving consumer goods already been indicating this slowdown.

‚ÄúAs it is becoming apparent that even festive demand has not been able to lift consumer sentiment and consumption demand, we believe 2HFY20 growth is also likely to be lacklustre resulting in an overall GDP growth of 5.6 per cent 2019-20. The low nominal growth rate of 6.1 per cent in the second quarter also does not augur well both for the government and the corporate sector as tax collection of the government and top line of corporate sector is linked to nominal GDP. However, given the current-growth inflation dynamics, we believe RBI will go for another 25bp rate cut in the forthcoming monetary policy review in December 2019,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar Sinha, Principal Economist, India Ratings & Research.

With declining household savings and lower buoyancy in government‚Äôs revenue collections, there will be limited fiscal space to spur economic growth. The slowdown is also expected to adversely affect income growth which, in turn, would further dent consumption demand. A favourable low base effect, however, would be seen third quarter onwards, which may help push the headline growth number higher.

All eyes are now on the use of the monetary policy tool through more rate cuts, with most economists expecting RBI to cut repo rate by 25 basis points in the upcoming December policy meet. Experts also said sector-wise demand stimulus, especially focused on the non-banking financial sector, will be the need of the hour.

‚ÄúJust to depend on another rate cut by RBI in the upcoming MPC meeting may not be sufficient. The situation demands a coordinated fiscal priming in areas with higher multipliers and where spends could be immediately combined with a monetary policy push to address the effective transmission of rate cuts to NBFCs. The effect of rural demand uptick on Q3 numbers will be crucial to avert a sub-5 per cent annual growth rate,‚Äù said Ranen Banerjee, Leader Public Finance and Economics, PwC India.

8,Urban jobless rate hits 4-quarter low at 9.3 per cent,"A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March. A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Unemployment rate in urban areas moderated to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters, the Periodic Labour Force Survey for the January-March quarter showed. The urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, stood at 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.8 per cent in April-June 2018.

Female unemployment rate, however, was higher than the overall rate at 11.6 per cent in January-March, lower than 12.3 per cent in October -December 2018 and 12.8 per cent in April-June 2018, while unemployment rate for males stood at 8.7 per cent in January-March, as against 9.2 per cent in the previous quarter and 9 per cent in April-June 2018.

A state-wise breakup for all years‚Äô age group showed female unemployment to be the highest in Jammu & Kashmir at 38.2 per cent, followed by Uttarakhand at 33.7 per cent and Kerala at 21.5 per cent in January-March.

Among males of all ages, the highest unemployment rate was seen in Odisha at 15.6 per cent, followed by Madhya Pradesh at 13 per cent and Delhi at 12.9 per cent.

Labour-force estimate, according to current weekly status (CWS), is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of seven days preceding the date of survey.

Explained Some relief, annual PLFS report awaited Urban unemployment rate, based on current weekly status, has slowed to 9.3 per cent in January-March, the lowest in at least four quarters. Female unemployment rate improved, though it continued to stay above the overall unemployment rate, at 11.6 per cent in January-March from 12.3 per cent in the previous quarter. At a time when there is overall slowdown in the economy, these figures show marginal improvement. However, going ahead, the key dataset to watch out would be the yet-to-be released annual PLFS report, which would provide unemployment rate for rural and urban areas for 2018-19.

Comparable figures for the January-March quarter of 2018 are not available as the first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ended December 2018 was brought out in May this year. To be sure, this data set differs from the Annual Report of Periodic Labour Force Survey, which covers both rural and urban areas and gives estimates of employment and unemployment in both usual status (ps+ss) and CWS.

The first annual PLFS report, which was first withheld and then released in May this year, was for July 2017- June 2018. The second annual PLFS report for July 2018-June 2019 is yet to be released.

As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above inched lower to 46.5 per cent in January-March from 46.8 per cent in the previous quarter.

Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also recorded a decline to 19.1 per cent in January-March from 19.5 per cent in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4 per cent in January-March from 73.6 per cent in October-December.

Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in January-March was recorded at 37.7 per cent, lower than 38.2 per cent for the previous quarter. Female LFPR for 15-29 years age group was at 16 per cent in January-March as against 16.7 per cent in the previous quarter, while for males, the LFPR moderated to 57.9 per cent in January-March from 58.3 per cent.

A state-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6 per cent and 6.0 per cent, respectively.

The worker population ratio, which gives an estimate of the workforce in the current weekly status, remained broadly at the same level as the previous quarter at 32.7 per cent in January-March, the data showed.

9,Youth unemployment rising with educational qualifications: Study,"‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image) ‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. (Representational Image)

A key takeaway from the study of India‚Äôs unemployment trends by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati Parida (of Jawaharlal Nehru University and Central University of Punjab, respectively) is the fast-rising trend of youth unemployment.

By youth, the study refers to people in the age group of 15 to 29 years of age. The total number of unemployed youth went up marginally from 8.9 million in 2004-05 to 9 million in 2011-12 but, has since shot up to 25.1 million in 2017-18.

READ | Employment falls first time ‚Äî by 9 million in 6 years: Study

What is worse is that the rate of unemployment (in per cent) is higher as one goes up educational attainment (see chart). Moreover, the authors have concluded that youth unemployment has risen for all categories of educational attainment. The states that housed most of these 25 million unemployed youth include Uttar Pradesh (3 mn), Andhra Pradesh (2.2 mn), Tamil Nadu (2.2 mn), Maharashtra (1.9 mn), Bihar (1.9 mn), West Bengal (1.5 mn), Madhya Pradesh (1.3 mn), Karnataka (1.2 mn), Rajasthan (1.2 mn), Odisha (1.1 mn), Gujarat (1 mn) and Kerala (1 mn).

Mehrotra & Parida have based their conclusions on the National Sample Survey Organisation‚Äôs Employment-Unemployment Surveys for 2004-05 and 2011-12, and the Periodic Labour Force Survey for 2017-18.

According to Mehrotra, while the total jobs in the agricultural sector have continued to decline massively from 232 million in 2011-12 to 205 million in 2017-18 ‚Äî and this is a desirable trend ‚Äî the rate of new job creation in the other sectors of the economy has not been enough to absorb the excess labour. As such, while jobs have gone up in the services sector (from 127 million to 144 million in 2017-18) and the non-manufacturing sector ‚Äî which includes activities such as construction, mining etc. ‚Äî from 55 million to 59 million, yet manufacturing, a sector which has the most capacity to soak up excess labour, saw total employment fall ‚Äî far from growing ‚Äî from 60 million to 56 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe slow growth (or scarcity) of non-farm jobs and the rising open unemployment together have resulted in a massive increase of disheartened youth,‚Äù state the authors. A reflection of this is that the number of youth (between ages 15 and 29) declaring themselves as ‚ÄúNot in Labour Force, Education, or Training‚Äù rose to over 100 million in 2017-18 from 83 million in 2011-12. ‚ÄúThese are young people who are disheartened by the state of affairs and are neither looking for jobs, nor are they interested in studying or training themselves,‚Äù says Mehrotra.

11,"Youth felt lack of jobs, so new panel to focus on it: Gujarat Chief Secretary","He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime.

A day after the Union government set up a Cabinet committee on employment and skill development, Gujarat Chief Secretary J N Singh on Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi formed the panel as during the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections youth were feeling about lack of employment and of not being engaged in the processes of national growth and national development.

Speaking at the inauguration of the first two-day annual Student Start-up Innovation Policy (SSIP) conference in Gandhinagar, Singh said, ‚ÄúDuring the entire (Lok Sabha) election process, youth was feeling that there is a lack of employment, lack of overall opportunities to get engaged in the national growth and national development. These are the few things that this Cabinet sub-committee (on employment and skill development) will look into.‚Äù

Pitching for start-ups as new job creators, Singh talked about a ‚Äúbleak‚Äù job scenario a ‚Äúlimit‚Äù to what big industries can offer jobs as. ‚ÄúIf you look at the overall perspective of what is likely to happen, whether the youth are getting employed as many times, we do feel that there is a bleak picture. The type of people are coming up, we feel very proud of a solid democratic dividend which a country very rarely has. India is passing through that democratic dividend phase, but are we actually going to harness that democratic dividend? Are we really in a position to take care and get the fullest advantage of the youth that we are having,‚Äù the chief secretary asked.

He said that there was a limit to what big industries can offer jobs as well as the service sector despite coming into a prime. But there‚Äôs a limit to the job creation and that is where the start-ups come in, he said, adding, ‚ÄúAnd as PM (Modi) keeps telling that the youth do not have to be job seekers but job givers. This is the what the youth of India and what the expectation from all of you is.‚Äù

Praising the entrepreneurship skills of Gujaratis, Singh said that the Gujarat government has been at the ‚Äúforefront of pioneering policies and institutions which have gone a long way in making an innovation culture at the grassroots level. ‚ÄúIn sync with various Central government schemes like Make In India, Start-Up India, Atal Innovation Mission, National Innovation Council, the Gujarat government has also taken very concrete steps to nurture, to support, to promote creativity, innovations and entrepreneurship,‚Äù he said.

The conference was organised the Education Department of the Government of Gujarat and was attended by Education Minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, Principal Secretary (Education), Govt of Gujarat Anju Sharma and Commissioner of Technical Education Avantika Singh Aulakh.

12,Sena: Nehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of jobs,"This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre. This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

The Shiv Sena on Monday criticised ally BJP over rising unemployment, saying that the ‚ÄúNehru-Gandhi family can‚Äôt be blamed for non-generation of 10 crore jobs that the BJP promised in 2014‚Äù.

This came as the first editorial of the Sena‚Äôs mouthpiece Saamana that was published after the party got the same heavy industries portfolio at the Centre.

In the editorial, the Sena said it seemed that the new government had started working but many challenges lay ahead. ‚ÄúWhile there was a rise in the satta bazaars and share market after hearing that the Narendra Modi government was coming to power, the GDP growth rate decreased and the rate of unemployment increased. It is not a good sign. Rather than only discussing and advertising on how to tackle it, action is required,‚Äù said the editorial.

The editorial referred to the National Sample Survey Office report that showed a rise in unemployment of 6.1 per cent.

‚ÄúThe Union labour ministry has confirmed it. These are not our figures. The ruling party is claiming that the rise in unemployment is not our sin. Nitin Gadkari said the BJP has not created the unemployment issue in the last five years. We agree with his view but it has not achieved the target of generating two crore jobs per year and ten crore jobs in the last five years. The Nehru-Gandhi family cannot be blamed for it,‚Äù said the editorial.

13,"Gujarat: 80% youth jobless, BJP govt failed on job issue claims Congress","Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs Industries sick, youth looking up to govt for jobs

The Congress, which has been demanding resignation of Chief Minister Vijay Rupani since the cancellation of the police recruitment exam last Sunday following paper leak, on Saturday upped its attack, saying that as the head of the government he has failed to rein in growing unemployment in Gujarat.

Quoting figures released by the Gujarat Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Federation of Industries Association, senior Congress leader Arjun Modhwadia said that 80 per cent youth are unemployed in the state.

‚ÄúYouth look up to the government jobs because industries have become sick and are unable to provide employment to qualified youths. For 9,000 government jobs, a whopping 9.12 lakh people applied,‚Äù Modhwadia said, referring to the number of candidates who had applied for the police recruitment exam that was cancelled last Sunday.

Arjun Modhwadia Arjun Modhwadia

The party also accused the BJP government of crony capitalism, saying ‚Äúrelatives of big industrialists were being facilitated under the disguise of helping the MSMEs (micro, small and medium enterprises), but the government is turning away genuinely needy entrepreneurs‚Äù.

Modhwadia also said that ‚Äúthanks to anti-industry policies of the BJP government, half of industries are shut and others are on the verge of closure‚Äù. ‚ÄúOut of 202 GIDC estates, only 102 are working, only two industrial estate were set up in the past 15 years of the BJP rule in Gujarat. Not only this, there has been a 10 per cent decline in finance to industries in the past seven months,‚Äù the former Congress Legislature Party leader said.

He said that in Surat textile units, 8.80 lakh people have been rendered jobless due to 40 production loss in looms. He also demanded charging of interest on idle industrial plots.

14,Economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government after operation J&K,"The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand) The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. (Express photo by Oinam Anand)

The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the symbol of the seat of power of the government. Within a one-kilometre radius are Parliament, the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, and North Block and South Block that house the key ministries of Home, Finance, Defence and External Affairs. The Prime Minister‚Äôs official residence is also within the radius of one kilometre as are the homes of the Vice-President, the Speaker, the three Defence Chiefs and most members of Parliament.

Multiple Conversations

What is the conversation in this power circle? It is about the dismembering of Jammu & Kashmir, the passage of controversial Bills in both Houses of Parliament, the capitulation of regional ruling parties, the dominance of Mr Narendra Modi, the laboured resolution of the issue of the leadership of the Congress party, and the sad passing of Sushma Swaraj. It is about everything except the economy.

Beginning barely 50 kilometres away in all directions from the centre, in practically every village and every poor urban neighbourhood, the conversation is radically different: it is mainly about the economy ‚Äî the decline or stagnation in real wages and real incomes, the lay-offs and retrenchments, the search in vain for jobs, the death and devastation caused by flood or drought, the crippling shortage of water and electricity, and the fight for survival in an unequal and harsh world.

About 1,150 kilometres away in Mumbai, the city that is home to the RBI, SEBI, the stock exchanges and corporate headquarters of many listed companies and banks, the conversation is about only one thing ‚Äî money, or the lack of it. It is about the steep decline in the BSE and NSE indices, the depreciation of the rupee, the rising yield on bonds, the mounting losses in public sector banks, the stiff taxes (and the heavy-handed enforcement), the pull-out by FPIs (foreign portfolio investors) and the suicide by V G Siddhartha, promoter of Cafe Coffee Day.

An Uncaring Government

In my view, a caring government will pay the highest attention to the conversation among the working people and the poor. The working classes may share other concerns and even vote according to popular perceptions, but they place their hope only in one thing ‚Äî the economy. Unfortunately, the economy seems to be the last of the concerns of the government which is barely able to conceal the triumphalism after Operation J&K.

Here is a snapshot of the economy:

1. GDP growth rate continues to decline. After 6.8% for the whole year and 5.8% in the last quarter of 2018-19, the first quarter of 2019-20 doesn‚Äôt seem too promising. RBI and others have lowered the forecast for the whole year 2019-20 to 6.9%; hence we will be lucky if the first quarter produces another 5.8%.

2. Core sector growth has dropped to a 50-month low of 0.2%. Capacity utilisation in all manufacturing segments is, on average, below 70%.

3. The rupee is now Asia‚Äôs worst-performing currency. It has fallen 3.4% against the US dollar in August.

4. Investment in new projects (private and government) announced in the quarter ending June 2019 declined to a 15-year low of Rs 71,337 crore. The value of projects completed in the quarter fell to a five-year low of Rs 69,494 crore. Revenue earning in rail freight (that comes from carrying coal, cement, petroleum, fertiliser, iron ore, etc) grew by 2.7% in April-June 2019, down from 6.4% in the same period last year.

5. In April-July 2019, exports (merchandise and services) grew by 3.13% over the same period last year while imports declined 0.45%, pointing to depressed economic activity.

6. Consumption is down as never before. In Q1 of 2019-20, car sales were down 23.3%, two-wheeler sales were down 11.7%, commercial vehicle sales were down 9.5% and tractor sales were down 14.1%. July was worse. Industry associations (SIAM and FADA) have reported that 2,30,000 jobs have been lost and 286 dealerships have been shut. In the construction industry, 12,80,000 units remained unsold at the end of March 2019.

7. Consumption of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCGs) was no better. Hindustan Lever, Dabur, Britannia Industries and Asian Paints, among others, have reported volume growth rate in April-June 2019 that is one half or less than the volume growth rate in the same period last year.

8. WPI in July stood at 1.08%. Within the index, the manufacturing sector inflation stood at 0.34%. These are not good signs, they are signs of low demand.

9. Gross tax revenue of the Central government grew by 1.4% in Q1 of 2019-20 as against 22.1% in the same period last year. What this tells us is that incomes are lower for corporates and individuals and spending is less.

Where is the Plan?

We go back to the mantra of four drivers of growth: government expenditure, private investment, private consumption and exports. Evidently, none of the engines is revving up and driving growth. This has been said so many times and by so many people (including acknowledged economists), but the government is unwilling to hear or understand or act. The economy is one area where muscular nationalism will not work. On the contrary, it may work to the detriment of the economy.

15,"National male workforce shrinking, says labour report that Govt buried","The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image) The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (Representational Image)

For the first time since 1993-94, the actual size of India‚Äôs male workforce, or men who are working, has shrunk. Data from the NSSO‚Äôs Periodic Labour Force Survey 2017-18, reviewed by The Indian Express, account for 28.6 crore employed male in the country. This is the first instance of a drop in the male workforce that steadily swelled from 21.9 crore in 1993-94 to 30.4 crore in 2011-12 when the last NSSO survey was conducted. This suggests fewer men were employed in 2017-18 compared with five years ago.

The decline in actual numbers occurred, again for the first time since 1993-94, in both rural and urban male workforce (see chart). The slide is steeper ‚Äî 6.4% ‚Äî in the rural areas compared to a 4.7% setback observed in the urban sector. The yet -to-be-released PLFS report put the unemployment rate for male in urban and rural segments at 7.1 per cent and 5.8 per cent, respectively.

Experts, who did not wish to be named, said the data requires deeper study, but clearly points to job losses, and fewer fresh employment opportunities.

The NSSO report, based on the PLFS conducted between July 2017 and June 2018, is yet to be released by the government. The Acting Chairperson of the National Statistical Commission P C Mohanan and another member, J V Meenakshi, quit January-end this year after the government withheld the release of the report that was approved by the commission in December 2018.

The NSSO data shows an employment loss of 4.3 crore (from 30.9 crore in 2011-12 to 26.6 crore in 2017-18) in the rural and 0.4 crore (from 11.1 crore in 2011-12 to 10.7 crore in 2017-18) in the urban segment. While the employment loss in the rural segment hurt the women most (68 per cent), men suffered more (96 per cent) job losses in the urban areas. In all, since 2011-12, India‚Äôs national workforce shrunk by 4.7 crore ‚Äî more than the population of Saudi Arabia.

Economists call for raising voice against suppression of data

Read | Even Mudra job survey data put in deep freeze

While the NSSO publishes employment rates in percentage ‚Äî and not actual workforce figures ‚Äî its data sets include details of populations, sex ratio, labour force participation rates, employment-to-population ratio etc. Overall, the PLFS 2017-18 reported a 6.1 per cent unemployment rate, a sharp jump from 2.2 per cent reported in 2011-12.

Explained Why this should be a worry A shrinking workforce suggests an increase in the number of unemployed, and also points to fewer new job opportunities. Given India‚Äôs demography and labour force growth over the decades, this should be a cause for concern.

Like the 2017-18 NSSO survey, the 2011-12 survey also recorded a major loss of employment in rural women which was largely offset by a reasonable jump in employment in rural male. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, women in rural employment shrunk by 22 million. In the same period, male in rural employment increased by 13 million. This resulted in a net rural employment loss of 90 lakh in that period (see Table 2). But the growth reversal in male employment since 2011-12 resulted in over four and half times that loss in national employment.

According to PLFS 2017-18, the percentage of working age (15-59 years) population that received any formal vocational/technical training actually came down from 2.2 per cent in 2011-12 to 2 per cent in 2017-18. Among the youth (15-29 years), however, a jump of 0.1 per cent is recorded in the same time period.

16,One crore jobs in last year: Here is how PM Modi built his case during speech in Lok Sabha,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the first day of the Monsoon session of Lok Sabha, at the Parliament in New Delhi. (PTI Photo)

Rejecting criticism that the government failed to create enough jobs, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said over one crore jobs were created in the country over the past one year. The PM, during no-confidence motion in Lok Sabha on Friday, mentioned the survey figures by an independent institute. To lend weight to his argument, he referred to employment figures available in the system including EPF, NPS, formal and informal sector. He talked about job growth and employment towards the end of his speech.

READ | No-confidence motion: How PM Modi and Rahul Gandhi pitched their lines for 2019

The PM said that many lies are being spread over the issue of unemployment in the country. ‚ÄúAgain, there is an attempt to trample the truth. There is no information but the opposition is just making baseless talks. Had they thoroughly looked into the matter (unemployment), they would not have committed the sin of playing politics by dashing the hopes of youths of the country,‚Äù he said.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister announced the government‚Äôs decision to publish job data every month. ‚ÄúThe government will present before the country all figures regarding employment present in the system, every month.‚Äù

This is how he tracked the employment and job growth in the last one year:

Employment in Formal sector- EPF, NPS data, Doctors, CAs, Lawyers

* ‚ÄúThere is a way to assess employment in the formal sector- through Employee Provident Fund (EPF),‚Äù he said, adding that in the nine months between September 2017 and May 2018, 45 lakh new subscribers had joined the EPFO, out of which 77 per cent were less than 28 years of age.

* The National Pension Scheme had attracted 5.68 lakh new subscribers during the same period. ‚ÄúTaking the EPF and NPS subscribers together, more than 50 lakh jobs were created in nine months,‚Äù he said, adding that this figure would reach 70 lakh for the whole year. PM Modi said data from the Employees State Insurance Scheme (ESIC) was not taken into account as Aadhar linking of subscribers was still underway.

* ‚ÄúBesides this, there are a number of professional bodies in the country from where young professionals register themselves and become self-independent. For example, doctors, engineers, architects, chartered accountants, company secretaries. According to the survey by an independent institute, 17,000 new Chartered Accountants have joined in the system. Of them, 5,000 have started new companies. If one Chartered Accountant institute provides employment to 20 people, then around 1 lakh CA‚Äôs must have got employment in such institutes.

* ‚ÄúIn our country, more than 80,000 postgraduate doctors, dental surgeons, and AYUSH doctors pass out of colleges every year. Of them, even if 60 per cent starts their own practice, then one doctor can provide employment to 5 other people, and this figure will be 2,40,000.

* In 2017, there were around 80,000 new undergraduate and postgraduate lawyers. Out of them, even if 60 per cent may have started their practice and provided employment to 2-3 people, then around 2 lakh new jobs are expected.

* ‚ÄúIn these three professions only (doctors, CAs and lawyers), more than 6 lakh people have got employment opportunity in 2017,‚Äù PM Modi said.

Informal sector: Transport sector including the sale of commercial vehicles, passenger vehicles and auto-rickshaws

* ‚ÄúNow if we talk about informal sector, then many people get employment in the transport sector. Last year, 7,60,000 commercial vehicles were sold. Even if we suppose that 25 per cent of this was a replacement of old vehicles, 5.7 lakh new vehicles were pressed into service for transporting goods. If one commercial vehicle has two people working on it, nearly 11.40 lakh jobs were created in this sector,‚Äù he said.

* If we see passenger vehicles, then this sale figure was 25,40,000. Out of that, if 25 per cent was a replacement of old vehicles, then 20 lakh new vehicles were on the roads. Even if 25 per cent of these new vehicles get a driver and conductor, then 5 lakh new jobs were created.

* Last year, 2, 55,000 autos were sold. Out of them, even if 10 per cent was a replacement of old autos, then around 2,30,000 autos were pressed into service last year. Since autos work in two shifts, three people get employed by 2 autos. In this way, 3,40,000 people got employment through new autos.

* In the transport sector alone, these three categories of vehicles have proved job opportunities to 20 lakh people, the PM said. ‚ÄúIf we combine all these figures from EPF, NPS, professions and transport sector, then around 1 crore new jobs were created in the last one year alone. This is conveyed through the survey of an independent institute. I am quoting that institute and not citing government data. Therefore, it is my request to not bury the truth without knowing the facts. There should be no effort to mislead the country in this regard,‚Äù the prime minister said in the Lok Sabha.

17,"Across the aisle: Governments hide, people seek","It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

How much can you hide behind one number? A lot, if the media played ball.

On the day after the Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the growth numbers for 2017-18, the media played up just one number: 7.7 per cent. At first blush it appeared to be the GDP growth number for the whole year 2017-18, and was certainly impressive. Actually, it was the growth number for just one quarter, Q4, and the uptick was also because of the low base effect. For the whole year, however, the GDP growth rate was a sobering 6.7 per cent.

The government puffed up the Q4 growth rate and claimed that the worst effects of demonetisation and a flawed GST were over. Mercifully, the government stopped short of making the claim that achhe din had arrived. At the end of four years, the government has switched over to a modest Saaf Niyat, Sahi Vikas (Clean intention, right progress)!

The path of the BJP-led NDA government‚Äôs four-year journey is littered with too many broken promises: Rs 15 lakh in every bank account, 2 crore jobs, MSP at cost + 50 per cent, waiver of agricultural loans, insurance cover to all farmers, peace and security in Jammu and Kashmir, a good and simple GST, and many more. You can add to the list from your own experience.

Look at Outcomes

At the end of four of the five years allowed to a government, the people cannot be expected to judge a government by its intent. The correct test is outcomes. Look at the boxes with the graphs. Every line depicts a measurable parameter. And every line, after showing promise in the first year, has dipped.

Some conclusions can be drawn without fear of contradiction. Beginning 2012-13, the economy was on the mend, and the GDP growth rate accelerated from 5.5 per cent in 2012-13 to 6.4 per cent in 2013-14 to 7.4 per cent in 2014-15 to 8.2 per cent in 2016-17. The story thereafter is one of steep decline. From 8.2 per cent to 6.7 per cent in two years, it is a fall of 1.5 per cent ‚Äî exactly what I had predicted after demonetisation.

Miserable Story

Other lines in the two boxes also tell the miserable story:

Credit growth dipped drastically from 13.8 per cent to 5.4 per cent before recovering somewhat in 2017-18. Within credit growth, it is credit to industry that is important. In the last four years, annual credit growth rates to industry were 5.6, 2.7, -1.9 and 0.7 per cent.

The index of industrial production (IIP) has remained flat. That number demolishes the claims on behalf of the much-touted Make in India programme. Besides, as far as defence production is concerned, the Make in India model was officially abandoned a few days ago (see Business Standard, June 6, 2018).

Gross NPAs have risen from Rs 2,63,015 crore to Rs 10,30,000 crore and will rise more. The banking system is practically bankrupt. I have not come across a banker who will willingly sanction a loan; nor an investor who will confidently borrow money. The economy is running on just one wheel ‚Äî government expenditure.

Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF), after falling from 31.3 per cent in 2013-14 to 28.5 per cent in 2015-16, is stuck at the same level for three years, proving my point that private investment is in the doldrums.

Merchandise exports hit a peak of USD 315 billion in 2013-14. Since then, the figure has struggled to cross USD 300 billion and, in two out of the four years, it was well below the peak.

Mood of Despondency

We could pick up more economic indicators and draw the lines on a graph. It will be the same story of poor analysis and reckless decisions (demonetisation, flawed GST, stagnant farm wages, high fuel prices, intimidating tax recovery, mala fide investigations etc).

The mood of the nation is despondent. In the RBI‚Äôs survey (May 2018), 48 per cent of respondents felt that the economic situation had worsened in the last one year. In some sectors, like agriculture, despondency has turned into anger. Among some sections of the people, like Dalits and unemployed youth, despondency has turned into despair.

It is not clear who is in charge or what policy changes will be made. The Cabinet is a mute spectator. The PM‚Äôs Economic Advisory Council has disappeared without a trace. I wonder how long will the government hide behind a number and a slogan.

18,"Congress to focus on agriculture, employment to challenge BJP","‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said (Representational Image) ‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said (Representational Image)

Ahead of polls in some states and the 2019 general elections, the Congress has decided to up the ante over issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty as it prepares to take on the ruling BJP, party sources said. For The Grand Old Party‚Äôs plenary session, to be held between March 16 and March 18 in the national capital, a separate resolution will be passed on issues related to agriculture, employment and poverty alleviation. During the last plenary session in 2010, agrarian and employment issues were part of the economic resolution.

The Congress has also formed a nine-member sub-group on ‚Äòagriculture, employment and poverty alleviation‚Äô under the chairmanship of former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Party leader Meenakshi Natarajan is the convener of the sub-group.

‚ÄúFarmers are under distress in the country currently. Given that the agrarian crisis has deepened, it warrants passage of a separate resolution that will guide the party‚Äôs future activities on this line,‚Äù a senior leader said, requesting anonymity. This, however, is not the first time that the party will have a separate resolution on agrarian and employment-related issues. The leader added that the Congress had passed a similar resolution in 2001.

‚ÄúWe had taken enough measures to see these problems do not surface when we were in power (till 2014). The situation was better when we had the last plenary session,‚Äù the leader claimed. Another party insider said the issues of employment and poverty alleviation have become ‚Äúacute‚Äù over the past three years.

‚ÄúThe economy has been paralysed due to the government‚Äôs double blow of demonetisation and GST. We will have to reach out to the people on the issues,‚Äù the insider added. The leader said that the party has already started reaching out to the youth and first-time voters on issues concerning them, including that of employment.

19,Modi Government Does Not Acknowledge the Word 'Slowdown': Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: In a sharp attack on the Narendra Modi government over the state of the economy, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday said the current dispensation does not acknowledge the word ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù, and the real danger is that if problems are not recognised, then finding credible answers to take corrective action is unlikely.

Addressing a gathering at the launch of Montek Singh Ahluwalia‚Äôs book Backstage: The Story behind India‚Äôs High Growth Years, Singh cited the former planning commission‚Äôs observations to state that achieving the target of $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 was ‚Äúwishful thinking‚Äù.

Singh said the former planning commission deputy chairman has written about the good as well as the weak points of the UPA government.

‚ÄúI think these issues will be debated and should be debated because we have today a government that does not acknowledge that there is such a word as slowdown. I think this is not good for our country,‚Äù the former prime minister said.

‚ÄúIf you do not recognise the problems that you face, you are not likely to find credible answers to take corrective action. That is the real danger,‚Äù he said, attacking the government on the state of the economy.

The book will be of great help to the future growth of the country, Singh said.

‚ÄúMontek has also pointed out that contrary to what the ruling group may say, today the $5 trillion economy by 2024-25 is wishful thinking. Also there is no reason to expect that farmers‚Äô income will be doubled in a three- year period,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúAt the same time, he (Ahluwalia) said we must work for high rate of growth and that 8% growth rate is a feasible proposition but it requires rethinking about the role of fiscal policy. There is a need for tax reforms in the country in a bolder way,‚Äù Singh said.

He also hailed the role played by former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, P. Chidambaram and Ahluwalia for supporting his liberalisation of the economy in the 1990s and enabling him as the then finance minister to carry out the reforms despite resistance from different quarters.

Later, during a panel discussion at the book launch, former finance minister Chidambaram said former chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs remarks that the Indian economy headed for intensive care unit, were ‚Äúnearly correct‚Äù.

‚ÄúI disagree in the following manner ‚Äì the patient (economy) is being wheeled into the ICU, the patient is being stopped just outside the ICU and is being looked at by incompetent doctors,‚Äù Chidambaram said in a dig at the government.

‚ÄúThere is no aggregate demand rise, unemployment is rising, consumption is falling‚Ä¶ Yet the government says all is well, which means we have to rewrite our textbooks of economics. Every indicator is pointing southward. If every indicator is pointing southward, how can the GDP rise to 7 or 8%,‚Äù he said.

Asked about his advice to finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Chidambaram said, ‚ÄúPlease resign.‚Äù

Participating in the panel discussion with Chidambaram, Ahluwalia, and former RBI governor Y. Venugopal Reddy, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister Bibek Debroy said there is a slowdown but if ‚Äúyou try to neatly pin that slowdown to something that happened in 2019 that is debatable‚Äù.

In his address, Manmohan Singh hoped that there will be consensus among right-thinking persons about the path that Ahluwalia had identified for dealing with the economic situation in the country.

Referring to the UPA years, he said, ‚ÄúThere will be question marks, there should be question marks and I hope there will be solid debate that will produce a better programme for carrying out the reform process further.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe that there is need for re-thinking of the reform process fresh. Second generation of reforms requires new pathways and these new pathways can emerge only with solid discussion of the alternatives,‚Äù he said.

Singh, who was the finance minister in the Narasimha Rao government rolled out the liberalisation policy, talked in detail about the resistance he faced at the time and the support he got from Rao.

‚ÄúWhen the reform period is written, I don‚Äôt know what the official narrative will be, but I for one know, it was a very tortuous path because the dominant opinion then was not in favour of reforms,‚Äù Singh said.

Singh said that in the business community there was the Bombay club which was formed to see that India does not move on the path of liberalisation, but he also knew that there was limited time due to dwindling reserves.

‚ÄúI had to tell president (then president) S Venkataraman that ‚ÄòMr president if we wait for a vote of confidence, I may have nothing to sell to the world about India‚Äôs story‚Äô,‚Äù Singh said.

‚ÄúI am very grateful to Prime Minister Rao that he stood by me. But I am also very grateful to Montek, to Chidambaram ji, to the then governor and deputy governor of the RBI who stood by me firmly so that we could carry out the reform process in the manner we wanted to,‚Äù he said.

During the panel discussion, Ahluwalia said there was no quiestion that India had entered a period of ‚Äúvery serious slowdown‚Äù.

He said that not only the drop in growth rate, but also rising unemployment among youth was a matter of concern.

Ahluwalia said he was against the restrospective taxation step of the UPA government, but it was not in his hands.

Chidambaram, in his remarks also acknowledged that the Congress party machinery had failed to take the economic achievements of the UPA years to the people."

As the year draws to a close, a sense of uncertainty and a feeling of resignation has slowly taken over our minds. One can argue rightly that this is a transitory phase. All the same, the doubts are refusing to die away.

The reason for doubt is quite apparent. All the critical economic numbers ‚Äì from GDP (gross domestic product) to inflation figure and trade data ‚Äì don‚Äôt give any reason for comfort. The quick slide in GDP number to below 4.5% from 8% in just four quarters is causing too much of an anxiety across policy planners and common man alike.

Poor IIP (Index of Industrial Production) numbers and weak consumption demand combine to sketch a distressing picture. Not surprisingly, the numbers on capital formation and investment have not shown any healthy growth. A former governor of the Reserve Bank of India has summed up the state of the economy quite nicely with a new term ‚Äì ‚Äúgrowth recession‚Äù.

What is equally concerning is that the portents appear to be not good, with the World Bank warning of a substantial risk in global trade and growth in advanced economies slowing down. With little headroom on the fiscal front, the Centre appears to have been caught in a pincer-like situation. With the political atmosphere heating up by the day in the wake of Citizenship Amendment Bill and following the victories by the opposition in two states, the Modi government has its plate full.

If the macroeconomic picture is turning out to be increasingly worrisome, events at the micro level are hurting significantly investor perception, causing further damage to the overall economy. The Reserve Bank of India was forced to refer Dewan Housing to the NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal). The Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative Bank imbroglio, which erupted just on the eve of Maharashtra State Assembly elections, has cut short the life of nearly half-a-dozen depositors even as unmindful political parties slugged it out to claim the right, nay power, to rule the state.

Prior to all this was the IL&FS debacle, setting off a chain of adverse reaction triggering a negative multiplier impact on the overall health of the economy. All these suggest to a dipping confidence level all around. There was also this Karvy fiasco, which saw promoters misusing the power of attorney given by clients for illegal fund-rising activity. It did so by pledging the shares of its clients!

How did all these scandals happen? Do we blame it on the inherent rot in the system? Should promoters be held accountable? What were India‚Äôs regulators doing? Where were the responsible characters in the entire chain while all this was happening? In all these instances, the real losers were common Indians, either as depositors or investors of one kind or the other.

The effect of 2019‚Äôs scams on the micro-level was palpable and felt instantly. On top of this though was the continuing agrarian crisis, a cause for farmer suicides. Somewhere along, the Modi government appears to have either allowed the situation to drift or not really gotten a hang of these fast-engulfing issues. When confidence in the economy is short and the threat of job loss high, a consumer has very little option but to exercise prudent and live only an existential life. This is having a chain reaction not just down the line but up the stream as well. Production, investment and everything else is reeling under the impact of this.

When senior industrialist Rahul Bajaj bluntly voiced the fear psychosis among its peers to home minister Amit Shaw in an open forum, probably he was articulating the exasperation experienced by the business community in the prevailing economic conditions. The fear reference made by Bajaj was somewhat sweeping, yet he managed to hit the nail on the head.

Is time running out for the Modi government to drive its men, machinery and ministers towards providing ‚Äòroti, kapda and makaan‚Äò rather than dissipating its energy on other diversionary issues?

As we slip into 2020, this will be a key question. The NDA government‚Äôs job is cut out and its first priority must be to to steady the rocking economic ship. No doubt, this government has not diluted its reform agenda. The fine-tuning of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ‚Äì its evolution, the recent amendment and the Supreme Court verdict in the Essar Steel case ‚Äì all give a sense of optimism in addressing the stressed asset problem of banks. The government‚Äôs disinvestment agenda, move for labour reforms and the like are equally important. These will take a while though to see results on the ground.

The near-term misery, however, requires a quick fix. The writing on the wall is all too clear. Action is what matters and not speeches from political podiums. The onus is definitely on the government. If the government can‚Äôt, nobody else can.

21,Facing the Reality: How Can Modi Reverse the Current Economic Slowdown?,"That the Indian economy is witnessing a slowdown is no longer a matter of debate after the Union finance minister acknowledged this reality. The days when the Indian economy was the fastest growing seemed distant when the second quarter of 2019-20 saw the growth stumble to 4.5%, the slowest in 26 quarters.

The three drivers of growth, namely, consumption, investment, and exports, have all moved downward. Consumption was reported to be at a four-decade low, with rural consumption lower by 8.8%, while urban consumption barely increased. In the second quarter of the current fiscal, gross fixed capital formation (at constant prices) grew by a mere 1% over the corresponding period of 2018-19, while exports recorded negative growth.

These numbers, in our view, reflect the combined impact of four factors, namely, policy shocks, agrarian crisis, steep increase in unemployment and steady decline in the share of wages and financial sector crisis.

Except for the first, the remaining three are structural impediments that have plagued the economy in the past decades.

Two policy shocks, namely, demonetisation and introduction of GST, were imparted in rapid succession. The micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) were especially impacted by demonetisation having lost 1.5 million jobs, according to estimates provided by the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy. The woes of the MSME sector were exacerbated by a poorly designed GST, which added a significant layer of uncertainty for the small businesses. The jobs and income losses resulting from the policy shocks caused demand shrinkage and sharp decline of investment.

India‚Äôs development model is skewed against the interests of the farm sector; the steadily falling share of the sector in the country‚Äôs GDP even when it supports an overwhelmingly large section of the working population. In 2005, the National Farmers‚Äô Commission (NFC) emphasised the need for amelioration of the condition of the farming community, especially by increasing minimum support price (MSP) and by extending it for other major crops.

After an initial interest shown by the UPA government to meaningfully increase MSP, this recommendation of the NFC has remained unimplemented. Consequently, the terms of trade between farmers and non-farmers, which had increased up to 2010-11, declined thereafter. At the same time, wages received by farm labour also became less remunerative: they grew by an annual average of nearly 17% between 2007-08 and 2013-14, but in the past three years, their growth was halved. These two developments squeezed rural demand.

The Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 reported massive decline in agricultural employment and very slow growth of non-agricultural jobs. The unemployment rate stood at 6.1%, of which unemployment rate among the urban male youth was nearly 19% while the unemployment rate for urban female youth was 27% per cent. These figures were the highest in 45 years. Worse still, the total employment witnessed a net decline to 471.3 million in 2017‚Äì18 from 472.5 million in 2012‚Äîthe first ever absolute decline in the post-independence period.

As for the urban sector, KLMES database produced by the RBI, shows that employment growth in manufacturing dropped to 1.4% and in services to 2% between 2011 and 2017 from 2.5% and 2.8 % respectively between 2004 and 2010. During the same period, labour earnings in the manufacturing sector declined from 8.1 % to 5.4% and in the services sector, from 7.2% to 6.1%.

Thus, falling rural income and urban labour earnings as well as skewed income distribution have resulted in domestic demand contraction while falling export growth has affected external demand.

Despite continuous capitalisation of the banking sector in the past several years (Rs 1.06 lakh crore in 2018‚Äì19 followed by Rs 70,000 crores in 2019‚Äì20), non-performing assets continued to grow. It stood at Rs 8.06 lakh crore on March 31, 2019. Even the non-banking financial sector is passing through a crisis. For example, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services has reported a negative net worth of Rs 16,935 crore in FY 19. These obviously adversely affected commercial credit off-takes. Financial sector crisis, together with demand slackness and investor pessimism have negatively impacted investment.

The government has taken several initiatives, including cut in corporation tax and announcement of packages for reviving sectors like the real estate, automobiles and exports. Ironically, all these are essentially supply-side measures, which would make no impact on a demand-constrained economy.

What should the government have done instead? Putting purchasing power in the pockets of those having high marginal propensity to consume should have received the topmost priority. This can easily be done through increased spending on schemes like MGNREGA, and by investing in education, health services and rural infrastructure. Such spending can immediately spur demand, which in turn would create inducement for potential investors.

In an exercise evaluating the impact of MGNREGA and two other social security schemes using the Social Accounting framework, we found that the indirect impact of expenditure on such schemes is considerable. Direct expenditure on a scheme like MGNREGA induces 1.8 times increase in indirect income and twice the direct expenditure in pension or basic income type scheme.

The government can garner enough resources for financing the above-mentioned initiatives by realising the undisputed part of tax and non-tax arrears, which, at the end of 2017-18, were around Rs 9 lakh crore and Rs 2 lakh crores respectively. It could also monetise the huge chunk of surplus land available with the Ministries of Defence and Railways, which was one of the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission.

Over the medium-term, efforts must be made to increase the tax-GDP ratio, which is the lowest among major economies, by levying wealth tax, among others. Besides, the GST must be reviewed and redesigned through reduction in the number of tax rates and increasing the base, and by improving the GST Network that the indirect tax system needs in order to be effective. All these measures would boost demand which in turn induce investment and reverse the downward trajectory of economic growth.

22,"Opposition Says Budget 2020 Does Not Address Unemployment, Slowing Growth","New Delhi: While most leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party termed Budget 2020 as ‚Äúvisionary‚Äù and ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù, opposition leaders panned it as lacking any concrete ideas to address problems such as rising unemployment and plummeting growth rate.

Soon after Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman finished the Budget speech, one of the longest in recent history, the BJP claimed that it addressed development for all sections of the society, on the lines of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs Sabka Saath Sabka Vikaas slogan.

‚Äú#JanJanKaBudget‚Äù: Union Budget 2020 ensures all-round development of all sections of the society. It will further fulfil PM Shri @narendramodi‚Äòs vision of making India a $5 trillion economy. https://t.co/CxTEgSCLeF ‚Äî BJP (@BJP4India) February 1, 2020



Within minutes, leaders from the saffron party took turns on Twitter to trend their praise with #JanJanKaBudget. However, not many pointed out why they felt it was visionary or futuristic.

PM Modi congratulated Sitharaman for preparing a Budget which he called was a mix of ‚Äúvision and action‚Äù. He went on to list out new reforms announced in the Budget.



The opposition leaders had concrete criticisms to offer.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said, ‚ÄúOur youth want jobs. Instead they got the longest budget speech in parliamentary history that said absolutely nothing of consequence. PM & FM both looked like they have absolutely no clue what to do next.‚Äù He said there was no central idea to rid India of unemployment or improve the poor state of the economy.

Former prime minister Manmohan Singh said that the Budget was ‚Äútoo long to absorb‚Äù.

Senior Congress leader and former finance minister P. Chidambaram briefed the media after the Budget. He said, ‚ÄúThere were multiple themes, segments and programmes, leaving the listener dazed and confused. It was a laundry list of old (that is current) programmes‚Ä¶ The government has given up on reviving the economy or accelerating the growth rate or promoting private investment or increasing efficiency or creating jobs or winning a greater share of world trade.‚Äù

Also Read: Budget 2020 Sidesteps the Question of What the Govt Should Do to Revive the Economy

‚ÄúThe Indian economy is demand-constrained and investment-starved. The FM has not acknowledged these two challenges, and that is a pity,‚Äù he said, adding that the government was ‚Äúin complete denial that the economy faces a grave macro economic challenge and the growth rate has declined in six successive quarters.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is nothing in the Budget that leads us to believe that growth will revive in 2020-21. The claim of 6-6.5% growth next year is astonishing and even irresponsible,‚Äù he said.

As an advocate of market economy, he lashed out at the government for adhering to protectionist policies. However, he also criticised it for reducing food, fertiliser and petroleum subsidies.

‚ÄúIt appears that the people will not get any relief on the price front. Please remember that CPI inflation is over 7% and food inflation is over 10%,‚Äù he said, adding there is no assurance that the finance minister will meet the targets set for 2020-21.

He also said that the government rejected every reform idea contained in the Economic Survey. ‚ÄúDid the FM read the Economic Survey? Was the chief economic adviser privy to the contents of the Budget speech? I think the answer to both questions is in the negative.‚Äù

Government clueless: CPI(M)

Calling the government ‚Äúclueless‚Äù about how to address the current economic crisis, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) said, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the Modi Government is only interested in providing the corporate sector and the wealthy relief rather than tackling the increasingly grim employment and livelihood situations of the working people ‚Äì workers, farmers and those forced into self-employment ‚Äì which is the root cause of the slowdown.‚Äù

It said that instead of increasing its social spending to address the demand crunch, the Budget has only aimed at ‚Äúreducing the fiscal deficit by further slashing government expenditures‚Ä¶the burden of which will be felt by working people.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶the expenditures on Central Sector Schemes in 2019-20 has been slashed by 11 per cent and Centrally Sponsored Schemes by 4.5 per cent ‚Äì covering areas like ‚Äì food subsidies, agriculture and allied activities, Development of the North-East, Social Welfare, Energy, etc. In the cuts proposed in 2020-21, MNREGA (Rs. 61,500 crore from Rs. 71,000 crore) and fertilizer subsidies are slated to join this list. Even the flagship schemes like PMJAY-Ayushman Bharat, Swachh Bharat and PM-Kisan have suffered major cuts. Allocations for the welfare of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, already way below the statutory requirements, have been cut in 2019-20. The Gender Budget allocation for 2020-21 similarly shows stagnation,‚Äù the Left party said in its statement, also adding that the government manipulated revised estimates of revenue figures.

‚ÄúRevised Estimates (RE) figures show that the revenue collections in 2018-19 are way below the Budget Estimates (BE), still they underestimate the extent of the shortfall. The RE figures of Central Tax Revenues are incompatible with the actual collections reported by the CGA for April-December of 2019-20. A realistic RE would have shown a further shortfall of close to 1.5 lakh crores in gross revenues from central taxes.‚Äù

He said even at the time of such high unemployment rate, funds for MGNREGS was slashed by 13%.

He also lashed out at the government‚Äôs proposals to indirectly privatise BSNL and LIC. ‚ÄúMore importantly, the LIC sale would be used to compensate the states on GST. What‚Äôs going on,‚Äù he asked. He also criticised the government‚Äôs move to remove at least 70 exemptions that people used to save income tax.

23,Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚ÄòBudget of Giveaways‚Äô Will Not Help India's Broken Economy,"It could have been the best budget India had had in the past decade. And the shortest. Instead, it was the worst and the longest. Early in January, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a quiet meeting with fifteen of India‚Äôs top industrialists to get their views on how to revive the economy. Apologising to them, for not having met them earlier, and not being able to meet them one-on-one even now, for shortage of time, he said:

‚ÄúPlease treat this as 15 one-on-one meetings, and tell me exactly what you believe will start the economy growing again. Please take as much time as you want. I will take notes on what you say.‚Äù

And that is what he did. There was a junior officer from the PMO in a corner of the room, who took notes. Halfway through the meeting, Modi began to take notes himself.

Among the industrialists, a consensus emerged on three issues: the need to revive stalled infrastructure projects instead of abandoning them and starting afresh, as new projects would prove far more expensive and take longer to complete; to make this possible by re-creating a purely investment bank on the lines of the old Industrial Development Bank of India, fund it to the tune of Rs 200,000 crore or thereabouts and get it to buy a large portion of the shares of the stressed companies, so that they became viable once more; and to bring down the GST from the present average of 22% to 15%, as had originally been suggested by Arvind Subramaniam, among others, when he was the chief economic adviser.

One other ingredient needed to complete the formula for recovery ‚Äì a further sharp lowering of lending rates by commercial banks to enable stressed companies to refinance their accumulated debt at a lower rate of interest (as the state governments had done after A.B. Vajpayee‚Äôs finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, had slashed lending rates in 2001 and 2002) remained unresolved. But had Nirmala Sitharaman even announced the other three measures, the Sensex would have shot up by 1,000 points instead of falling by an equal amount.

But Sitharaman was not present at the meeting. Nor was there any hint in the Economic Survey that she might have been briefed by the prime minister. Indeed the absence of any meaningful coordination between the PMO and the Ministry of Finance was visible in the Economic Survey, presented yesterday, for the survey once again described the economic crisis as a ‚Äòcyclical slowdown‚Äô, and recommended what is usually called ‚Äòpump priming‚Äô ‚Äì an infusion of spending power into the economy to boost demand. And that is about all that Sitharaman‚Äôs ‚Äòbudget of giveaways‚Äô will achieve.

Spending power and economic recovery

Will more spending power suffice to trigger an economic recovery. The drop in the Sensex shows that the market knows it will not. For what India is in the throes of is not a (trade) cyclical slowdown but an economic breakdown. Cyclical slowdowns automatically reverse themselves of one waits long enough. Two centuries of experience of the industrialised market economies has shown that the usual trade cycle rarely takes more than seven years to complete itself. India‚Äôs ‚Äúslowdown‚Äù ‚Äì the so-called downward phase of this ‚Äúcycle‚Äù, is now in its ninth year. It is therefore time for this government to concede that India is suffering not an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown.

Also Read: With No Big Bang Steps, Budget 2020 Focuses on Untangling the Fiscal Math Mess

Clinging to the politically convenient belief that all we are suffering from is a slowdown has prevented the government from even mapping, let alone applying, the remedies that are needed to re-start economic growth. For all that it has done so far is to get the RBI to bring its main policy interest rate, the Repo rate, down from 6.5% to 5.15% between February and October 2019. This has, predictably, done nothing to halt the slide down in India‚Äôs GDP growth rate from 6.8% in 2018-19 to an expected 4.9% this year.

The blame for this is now being put upon commercial banks, who are being castigated for passing on less than a third of this rate cut to borrowers. But the policy making apparatus of the RBI and the Ministry of Finance has shied away from asking why they are not doing so. The answer, which they undoubtedly know but are not willing to discuss, is that such a large proportion of their loans is now irrecoverable, that they are no longer able to meet their interest commitments to depositors and various government subsidisation programmes. They cannot therefore be blamed for fearing that a further reduction of lending rates will tip them into the red.

How has India‚Äôs vibrant economy been broken? The single, short answer is, ‚Äòby a regime of monstrously high rates of interest born out of the RBI‚Äôs unquestioning, and economically stupid, adoption of the doctrine of ‚Äúinflation targeting‚Äù. This doctrine was coined in 1992 by the Bank of England and adopted with alacrity by industrialised countries and the IMF because it yielded not only price but also exchange rate stability. The rich nations needed the latter even more than the former because it was an absolute pre-requisite for maintaining their currencies as the reserve currencies of the world, and attracting the export surpluses, and private savings of the wealthy in the rest of the world as capital transfers into their banks. Faced with de-industrialisation, a shrinking tax base and mounting social security commitments to an ageing population at home, these inflows were essential for allowing them to continue living beyond their shrinking means.

To the rich nations, price stability was the end in itself, so knowing the cause of the inflation was not important. But for developing countries knowing whether it was an excess of demand or shortages of supply was a matter of life and death. For imposing high interest rates on an economy where prices were rising because of shortages of supply could only worsen the shortages and push up prices further. In short inflation targeting in a shortage ridden economy produced not growth but stagflation.

If stagflation is allowed to persist long enough, it ends not in an economic slowdown but an economic breakdown. That is what India is in the throes of today. By the middle of 2018, India had Rs 1,160,000 crores worth of abandoned projects, nearly all in infrastructure and heavy industry; the public sector banks had more than Rs 9,60,000 crores of irrecoverable debt and had lost their capacity to lend, and this had created a funds crisis in the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFC) sector, which oiled the wheels of the economy through its various rapid payment systems.

The capacity and willingness to take risk

What was worse, eight years of relentless inflation targeting by the RBI, begun in March 2010, had ended by destroying entrepreneurship ‚Äì the capacity and willingness to take risk, which is the essential fourth requirement of modern economic growth (after land, labour and capital). By June 2018, 78 of the largest companies in the country were facing dissolution under the Indian Bankruptcy Code. Of them, 20 had already been declared insolvent and sent to the National Company Law Tribunal for dissolution.

Another 30 companies, all in the power sector, were facing the same fate because the Allahabad high court had denied them more time to sort out their woes. The debt of these companies alone amounted to Rs 140,000 crore. Another 92 companies were headed for the chopping block because they were more than 180 days behind on their loan repayments. And loan defaults by small companies had doubled in the previous 12 months, heralding the NBFC financial crisis that burst into the open at the end of the year.

Since then, things have grown dramatically worse. Nirmala Seetharaman‚Äôs budget could be the Indian economy‚Äôs death.

24,"As India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown Deepens, Is It Time to Reconsider Cash Transfers to the Poor?","India‚Äôs precarious economic situation has everyone worried and rightly so. Two weeks ago, we got news that India‚Äôs nominal GDP growth is at its lowest in 45 years. Even that is perhaps a rosier picture than the ground reality according to the former chief economic advisor of the Narendra Modi government who has cast doubts over GDP measurement and said that the measured GDP is overstated. There is simply no dispute that India‚Äôs economic growth has collapsed, regardless of how and who measures it. So, what is the way out of this mess?

Several economic commentators, finance ministers and Nobel laureates are now in consensus about the remedy: stimulating demand in the economy. Nobel laureate Esther Duflo recently called for a ‚ÄòTUP‚Äô policy ‚Äì targeting the ultra-poor by giving them cash which they will spend immediately. Bengal‚Äôs finance minister Amit Mitra in a recent interview specifically called for a direct cash transfer to the poorest sections of society to stimulate consumption. Another Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee said that the situation is so egregious that fiscal deficit concerns should not be a hurdle to boosting demand through a stimulus package. Nearly every major newspaper has carried an editorial calling for a demand stimulus. Never before has there been such an overwhelming consensus in an economic policy prescription for the country across all hues of commentators.

Also Read: Budget 2020: Here Are Five Challenges Nirmala Sitharaman Is Facing

Not too long ago, there was precisely such an idea proposed for the Indian economy. An idea to target 20% of the poorest households in every district in the country and give them a direct cash transfer of Rs 6,000 a month which would then stimulate demand and revive private investment, which in turn would lead to more jobs and a healthier economy. The idea was called NYAY, which was part of the manifesto of the Congress party for the 2019 parliament elections.

The Congress party diagnosed the rapidly deteriorating state of the economy, assembled a group of experts, and presented a solution to pull the nation out of the impending economic crisis. In fact, the party believed in it so strongly that NYAY became the centrepiece of the campaign, contrary to some recent fallacious narratives that the economy was not the focus of the Congress party‚Äôs campaign.

Of course, the party could not convince voters, either because the NYAY message did not reach enough people or voters did not believe the message. Regardless, just nine months later, the same idea to revive a sagging economy by stimulating demand through cash transfers to the poor is now a consensus prescription.

The Modi government should not be churlish to dismiss this consensus solution of experts to pull our economy out of distress, only because the Congress party originated the idea. Economics and governance should transcend politics. The ‚ÄòSarva Shiksha Abhiyan‚Äô was pioneered by the Vajpayee government and carried forward by all successive governments, the Aadhaar programme was mooted by the Congress party and continued by the Modi government amid many such examples of policy ideas adopted across governments and political parties. NYAY, in perhaps a different shape and form, remains the most relevant solution to our current economic crisis and the Modi government should embrace it.

The Modi government has been whimsical and knee-jerk in their prescriptions for the economic crisis, like a deer caught in headlights. Out of the blue, one day in September, just before the prime minister embarked on his visit to the US, the finance minister announced a steep reduction in corporate tax rates and claimed that it would cost the exchequer nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore and help revive the economy. Even a cursory analysis would have revealed that a corporate tax cut at this juncture would only be used by corporates to reduce their loan liabilities and not to invest more in capacity building since consumer demand is very weak.

If using the same amount, had five crore poorest households been given say Rs 5,000 a month for six months, the poor would have spent it immediately, fueling demand and reviving private investment. Of course, such a move would not have elicited the blaring headlines in the media the next day that the corporate tax cut announcement did. Four months later, it is now acknowledged that the corporate tax cuts were mere hogwash.

Why can‚Äôt states such as Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab or Chhattisgarh ‚Äì governed by the Congress party ‚Äì implement NYAY is the other common refrain one hears. NYAY was conceived as a scheme that will be implemented by both the Centre and states, which would give it the required fiscal capacity. Post-GST, state governments have lost all powers of generating their own tax revenues for state-specific programmes. So, even if say, the Rajasthan government wants to raise taxes on other goods to generate funds for cash transfer to the poor, it cannot do so.

In fact, a democratically elected chief minister of a state in today‚Äôs India has almost no powers to raise revenues for her state since both direct and indirect taxes are controlled by the Centre or the GST Council. Hence, a scheme like NYAY cannot be implemented at the state level any longer, which is a travesty of federalism.

The keys to the solution to India‚Äôs current economic catastrophe is only with the Union government in Delhi. The solution is to revive demand by putting money in the hands of the poor.

Our analysis for NYAY showed that it is both possible to target the poorest households as well as pay for the scheme through a combination of expenditure rationalisation and a modest fiscal expansion. The PM needs to act boldly and decisively. Now is not the time to indulge in petty quibbles over ownership of ideas. Let us all agree that good policy ideas belong to the people of the nation.

25,Economic Slump: India‚Äôs Rickety Bridge Over Troubled Waters,"Raghuram Rajan, the-then outgoing Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, in an exit interview he granted to Karan Thapar (‚ÄòTo The Point‚Äô, YouTube, September 2, 2016), took satisfaction from the fact that India was ‚Äúon a more sustainable growth path‚Äù.

The remark turned out to be premature. Less than two years later, starting the first quarter of FY 18/19, ominous signs of weaknesses started to emerge. GDP growth, which has been sliding continuously over six quarters, reached 4.5% per annum in the second quarter of FY 19/20. The slide may not be over yet.

If engineers inspecting a bridge find serious structural weaknesses, they can only conclude that the bridge is unsafe. But, their science cannot predict when the bridge will come down. Similarly, a detailed analysis of structural economic weaknesses cannot predict the timing of the next slump. Economists can at best be faulted for not being cognizant enough of the risks to the sustainability of growth.

The euphoria about India‚Äôs prospects following the economic reforms of 1991 is understandable. After all, growth had averaged just about 3.5% per annum in the pre-reform period. Moreover, the economy‚Äôs performance was more volatile with brief spurts in growth punctuated by painful crashes. The opening up of the economy through less state intervention not only ratcheted growth upwards to about 7% per annum on average, they came with far less volatility.

According to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), some 271 million Indians were lifted out of poverty between 2005/06 and 2016/17. Reports issued by various large US multinational companies like Cisco, Citi and PwC held out the possibility that India would become the second-largest economy in the world after China and possibly an advanced country by 2050. The findings were reported by several major international and Indian newspapers.

Laudable as those achievements were, growth was not inclusive. While the top 1% of earners walked away with 22% of national income, the top 10% accounted for a whopping 56%. Had growth been inclusive, the resulting rise in incomes and opportunities would have been equitably shared by all income groups sharply reducing inequality over time. It is not surprising why attaining inclusive growth is far more difficult than boosting growth rates themselves.

Why India‚Äôs growth story is not sustainable

In a recent article (Why Let a Good Crisis Go to Waste? What India Needs to Remember to Overcome its Economic Slump, The Wire, November 20, 2019), I pointed out that corruption and poor governance have not only spawned rising income inequality but a host of other economic maladies as well. I was not trying to explain the downturn in terms of some recent developments like the collapse in consumption. Rather, I was referring to the structural weaknesses in the Indian economy as the genesis of India‚Äôs current economic predicament.

While it is possible for highly corrupt countries to register impressive rates of growth for a few years, widespread and entrenched corruption will thwart the sustainability of growth. Studies by the IMF and other international organisations point out a number of serious consequences of corruption.

First, corruption reduces the rate of growth. As a result, poverty in India could have been reduced at a faster pace were it not for corruption. The United Nations, based on data produced by the World Economic Forum, noted that the worldwide cost of corruption is at least 5% of global GDP.

Also read: The Short-Term and Long-Term Measures Needed to Reverse India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown

Second, as I noted earlier, weakly governed countries tend to invest far less in health and education than strongly-governed ones. Thus, when growth takes place, only the elites can take advantage of the expanded opportunities whereas the vast majority cannot qualify for well-paid jobs in the organised sector. They are left with little alternative but to eke out a living working in low-skill jobs in the informal sector. In short, countries with endemic corruption also tend to be highly unequal.

In fact, income inequality based on officially reported incomes collected through household income surveys significantly understate actual inequality. This is because the upper income groups, who are the main drivers of black money incomes and assets, understate their incomes in household surveys conducted by the government. If reported incomes were to include black money incomes generated from domestic and foreign assets, actual inequality would be worse than calculated inequality based on official income data.

The greater actual inequality would have a larger destabilising effect than the measures available to economists would suggest. Assuming demonetisation left corruption intact, domestic black monies transferred abroad would return another day as inflows to drive up the stock market and other investments. Such round-tripping is often an elaborate scheme to launder dirty money.

Black money is mainly used to finance illegal and speculative transactions rather than boost productive investments in the official economy. In fact, while legitimate domestic investments have been on a declining trend, inflows of black money did nothing to help the economy. Regardless of how much black money was captured and surrendered to banks and how much could be traced to illegal activities, corruption cannot be curtailed without strengthening governance in all its aspects such as rule of law, effectiveness of regulatory oversight, quality and stability of politics, etc. To claim that demonetisation will curtail corruption is like putting on a winter jacket and expecting it to snow.

Third, wide-spread corruption leads to tax evasion by promoting a culture that tolerates the practice. The IMF finds that even among developed countries, strongly-governed ones collect about 4.5% of GDP more than relatively more corrupt ones. And that‚Äôs a lot of money the government could have used productively. The longer corruption rules, the more difficult it gets to dislodge it. In fact, as I have argued in my earlier article, corruption has restricted India‚Äôs fiscal space thereby significantly limiting the scope of a consumption-boosting targeted basic income.

Fourth, corruption has reduced the effectiveness of government services through bribery, a reduction in compliance with government regulations, and the imposition of additional costs on investment projects. India‚Äôs ‚ÄúD‚Äù rated government effectiveness has led to a lack of public trust in officials and the quality of government services. This in turn promotes tax evasion because taxpayers do not feel that they are getting their money‚Äôs worth.

Fifth, researchers at the IMF found that child and infant mortality rates as well as the proportion of low-birthweight babies in countries with endemic corruption are much higher compared to countries where corruption is low. Moreover, school dropout rates are five times as high partly due to less effective government spending. The poor quality of public school education in India is consistent with these findings.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis.

Finally, highly corrupt countries tend to be much more polluted than countries that are strongly governed. India is a perfect example of the nexus between rampant corruption and serious environmental degradation.

The tendency towards greater pollution is explained by the poor law and order, lack of environmental awareness, weak environmental regulations and their enforcement, bribery of regulatory officials, and a dearth of equipment and trained manpower to monitor compliance with regulations.

Hence, it is crucial to attain economic growth that is not only inclusive but environmentally sustainable as well. Inclusive policies by themselves cannot ensure that industries would comply with policies to protect the environment.

Sir Partha Dasgupta, Professor Emeritus at Cambridge University, finds that the fault lies in formulating economic policies which do not treat fresh water, clean air, and land as resources which could be depleted in the production process. Given that no country has an inexhaustible supply of these resources, there is a dire need for appropriate regulation, monitoring for compliance, and user fees to pay for clean-up and renewal. His work shows that environmental degradations will effectively derail economic growth if policies are not designed to take explicit account of these consequences.

Also read: GDP Data: Investment Growth at 19-Quarter Low Despite Modi Govt‚Äôs Stimulus Measures

This is not to suggest that growth strategies necessarily need to evolve from a low to a higher trajectory through reform before they can be inclusive as well as sustainable. Countries like Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan which made significantly larger investments in health and education were not only successful in ensuring more equitable outcomes and opportunities when growth occurred but have also avoided environmental degradation from limiting growth in the long run.

The primacy of volition

Even though structural issues are deeply embedded and take far longer to mitigate than counter-cyclical policies aimed at stimulating the economy, here too governments can do a lot more than pray.

Vito Tanzi, a fiscal expert and one-time director of the IMF‚Äôs fiscal affairs department, in an article on corruption around the world, opined that successful efforts against corruption typically begin with examples set by a country‚Äôs leadership. Top political leaders should not only provide the right example of honest living but should support stern legal action against corruption from any quarter regardless of political affiliations. If, on the other hand corrupt acts by friends, relatives, or political associates are condoned, then it would not be realistic to expect that public officials or indeed the country at large will behave honestly.

The first step on the road to redemption is therefore the hardest one‚Äîleaders should set the right example, help support the appropriate laws, and implement a distinct plan for tackling corruption in all its manifestations. In short, the anti-corruption agenda must be strongly underwritten by the country‚Äôs leadership and the state governments as well. India needs to reduce corruption on a credible and sustained basis in order to better cushion the impact of difficult global economic conditions.

Global economic headwinds

In October, the IMF cut its forecast for this year‚Äôs global growth to 3.0% from 3.9% in January. Strong headwinds facing major economies such as geopolitical instability, business uncertainties, tariffs, and trade tensions, were responsible for the more somber outlook. The US Federal Reserve Bank began to cut its overnight lending rate to banks in July this year. The lending rate was lowered in three steps to a target range of 1.5 to 1.75% in October.

With the European Central Bank‚Äôs policy rate already in negative territory, the Federal Reserve‚Äôs rate cuts were accompanied by a significant decline in long-term bond yields. Stock markets are surging because of falling long-term interest rates and higher bond prices, not in spite of them.

Also read: The Dangers of Dismantling India‚Äôs Public Sector

The reason is investors have nowhere to place their funds to make a decent return other than in stock markets and other riskier investments, thereby driving their growth. So, there is no contradiction between weakening economies on the one hand and surging stock markets on the other.

While the easy money of central banks is meant to prop up slackening economic growth, the downside is that low interest rates are encouraging households to incur more debt and firms to take on greater financial risks. The corporate sector in India is carrying a heavy debt load and some may default on their loan repayments and fold, while others may require a rollover of debt or some sort of corporate debt restructuring.

Conclusion

We can expect the world economy to enter a protracted period of low growth, low demand, and low-inflation, its driving gear stuck in neutral. While well-heeled investors and pension funds around the world have earned handsome returns in the soaring stock markets and other riskier assets, these are dark waters.

The deadweights of corruption, inequality, and environmental degradation would make it more difficult for India to deal with the crisis and impose a heavy cost in terms of lost output, income, and jobs, along with an increasing risk of economic and political instability. These structural weaknesses need to be addressed on an urgent basis.

26,"In World's Biggest Early Childcare Scheme, Workers Don't Even Get Minimum Wage","Mysuru, Tumakuru and Ballari, Karnataka: The mud-and-bamboo anganwadi is about three kilometres from her house, deep inside the Nagarhole National Park and Tiger Reserve in Mysuru district, Karnataka. But little keeps Sita B., a young Yerwa tribe woman, from walking the distance every day to the Manamelkudi village anganwadi, where she works as worker and helper.

On the way, she picks up fresh vegetables and eggs to serve 14 children of the Jenu Kuruba tribe, aged three to six years, registered with the anganwadi. There are nine more children aged six months to three years, and Sita gives them their monthly share of take-home rations under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme of the Government of India.

ICDS is the world‚Äôs largest programme for early childhood care and development, with over 158 million children (2011 Census) in the 0-6 years age group, and pregnant and lactating mothers in the country. It offers six services: supplementary nutrition, preschool non-formal education, nutrition and health education, immunisation, health check-up and referral services, through 1.36 million functional anganwadi centres spread across all the districts in the country (as of June 2018).

¬ß

According to the Union health ministry‚Äôs Comprehensive National Nutrition Survey 2016-2018, 32.5% of children younger than five years in Karnataka are stunted (lower height for age) and 12.4% are severely stunted. Over 32% are underweight (lower weight for age) and 19.3% are wasted (lower weight for height). A little over 34% of children aged one to four years also have anaemia.

The national scenario isn‚Äôt better. The same survey found that 35%, 33% and 17% of children under five in the country are stunted, underweight and wasted, respectively. About 11% of children aged six to 59 months months were in fact found to be acutely malnourished.

The Karnataka state department of women and child development has launched multiple schemes to fight malnutrition and is implementing them through anganwadi centres. For example, under the Ksheera Bhagya scheme, children aged six months to six years receive 150 ml of cream milk five days a week, supplied by the state government at a cost of Rs 124.14 crore per annum.

As part of the Srusti programme, children aged three to six years at anganwadi centres are provided eggs twice a week. Severely malnourished children aged six months to three years are provided eggs three days a week, whereas severely malnourished children aged three years to six years are offered eggs five days a week.

Apart from its 50% share under the ICDS, the Karnataka government gives Rs 11.50 per pregnant and lactating woman under Mathrupoorna, a scheme that grants nutritious meals, counselling and other healthcare facilities to pregnant and lactating women at anganwadi centres for six days a week.

Families with children who have severe acute malnutrition receive Rs 2,000 in medical benefits, plus Rs 1,000 a year for medicine kits at each anganwadi centre in the state.

The data suggests all these schemes together have had appreciable effect. For instance, 36.2% of children under five in Karnataka were stunted according to the 2015-2016 National Family Health Survey and 32.5% in the 2016-2018 survey. Similarly, wasting in children younger than five years has dropped from 26.1% in 2015-2016 to 19.3% in 2016-2018, and the fraction of underweight children has dropped from 35.2% to 32%.

These achievements also highlight the centrality of anganwadi centres ‚Äì and the women who work there ‚Äì to the state‚Äôs ambitions regarding the health and care of its most vulnerable people.

The ICDS population norms specify one centre for a population of 800 and a mini-anganwadi for a population of 150 to 300. According to the state department of women and child development, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi centres: 62,580 are main and 3,331 are mini-centres.

These centres are staffed by frontline health staff: one anganwadi worker and one anganwadi helper each, both typically women. Thus, Karnataka has 65,911 anganwadi workers and 62,580 anganwadi helpers. All the anganwadis together cater to the needs of 3.86 million children between the ages of six months to six years.

¬ß

The tribal village of Manamelkudi is home to 42 Jenu Kuruba tribe families and has a mini-anganwadi centre, where Sita works as worker and helper both.

‚ÄúI have been working at the Manamelkudi anganwadi for the last five years and am used to walking three kilometres to the centre [every day]. Sometimes I feel scared of tiger or elephant attacks, which are common in [the] forest area,‚Äù Sita told The Wire. She receives a monthly honorarium of Rs 4,750.

Managing children, their daily meals, preschool lessons, health and hygiene, and counselling pregnant and lactating mothers isn‚Äôt easy because she has to do it all alone. (Per ICDS norms, there can be only one worker-cum-helper per mini-anganwadi.)

However, Sita has been able to make sure the children in her anganwadi eat their meals hot, cooked freshly by her, and drink clean water. She also regularly monitors their growth and records the information in their respective growth charts. Unfortunately, the Manamelkudi anganwadi does not have a toilet.

Not very far away lies Balle, another Jenu Kuruba tribal village lying inside the Nagarhole National Park. It has two anganwadi centres and both function from the same tin-shed structure, without a toilet.

‚ÄúOur anganwadis [have been] operating since 2010, when they were located inside a government school building,‚Äù Pushpa, one of the anganwadi workers. ‚ÄúA few years ago, the school building collapsed but the forest department didn‚Äôt permit new construction, so we are functioning out of a tin-shed structure.‚Äù

Sharda, the other worker, said the forest department had recently okayed a new anganwadi building and that it was expected to come up soon.

There are about 14 anganwadi centres functioning inside the boundaries of the Nagarhole forest. This isn‚Äôt easy. There is a constant threat of animal attack, and the anganwadi workers and helpers come from houses located far away. It is difficult to find educated local tribal women to work at an anganwadi because a worker has to be college-educated and an anganwadi helper has to have studied till at least class IV.

It is women like Sita, Sharda, Pushpa and thousands more who form the backbone of the ICDS scheme.

As it happens, they are not happy.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding the legal minimum wage from the government but the Central government has been deaf to our demands,‚Äù S. Varalakshmi, president of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers‚Äô Association, told The Wire. ‚ÄúIt is not ready to compensate us adequately for the labour and the number of hours we put in.‚Äù

In April 2017, Karnataka raised the honoraria for anganwadi workers and helpers from Rs 4,000 and Rs 3,000 a month to Rs 8,000 and Rs 4,000 a month, respectively. The state government also reimburses their medical expenses to the tune of Rs 50,000 a year and provides pension. Additionally, the state department of women and child development has supplied twin-burner stoves, LPG cylinders and water filters to all anganwadi centres in the state.

Last October, the state government decided to further increase the monthly salaries of anganwadi workers and helpers to Rs 10,000 and Rs 5,000, respectively, and of mini-anganwadi to about Rs 6,500. ‚ÄúThe state government has sanctioned higher honoraria but the same have not been implemented thus far due to some technical glitches,‚Äù Varalakshmi said. ‚ÄúIt is expected to be fixed soon.‚Äù

However, the Union ministry of women and child development has approved a much lower salary amount. In September 2018, it issued a circular on ‚Äúenhancement of honorarium‚Äù of anganwadi workers from Rs 3,000 per month to Rs 4,500 per month. The pay for anganwadi helpers was raised from Rs 1,500 per month to Rs 2,250 per month. For mini-anganwadi worker-cum-helper, the ministry approved just Rs 3,500 per month.

Varalakshmi alleged the Centre was trying to push the entire burden onto the states. ‚ÄúEarlier, the honorarium for anganwadi workers and helpers was shared between Centre and the states in the ratio of 90:10. Now, the Centre has revised it to 60:40,‚Äù she said. According to her, anganwadi workers should get at least Rs 18,000 per month and helpers Rs 9,000 per month. Kerala is the only state that provides minimum wages to all workers. The Goa government offers a monthly salary of about Rs 13,000, and both Haryana and Andhra Pradesh give Rs 11,000 per month.

Is this enough?

Anganwadi workers and helpers in various states, including Karnataka, have been demanding a raise. Last December, anganwadi workers across Karnataka launched a protest against the state government‚Äôs decision to start pre-primary classes in government schools . There were protests in Belagavi for delays in the release of incentives for anganwadi workers and helpers.

¬ß

The Karnataka government has a ‚Äòconvergence‚Äô programme as part of which it uses funds allocated for the fulfilment of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) to build anganwadi centres in the state.

For example, the anganwadi in Somlara village of Tumakuru district is 14 years old. For the first 12, it operated out of a rented space against a payment of Rs 700 per month. Two years ago, the government erected a new anganwadi building with Rs 6 lakh from MGNREGA funds.

‚ÄúOne of the villagers donated four gunthe of land to construct the anganwadi. Children love the new anganwadi and parents are also happy sending them here,‚Äù T.K. Bhagyamma, the anganwadi worker at Somlara, told The Wire.

At Giriyammanapalya village in Madhugiri, Reshma has been managing an anganwadi centre since 2007. ‚ÄúUntil April 2018, I was running the anganwadi from a rented place. In May 2018, a new anganwadi building was constructed with MGNREGA fund,‚Äù she said.

Indeed, these new buildings are swanky and spacious, with separate kitchens and tiled toilets. Many of them have attached gardens as well, and vegetables grown there are used to prepare meals for the children.

Srikanth, deputy director of the department of women and child development for Tumakuru, said, ‚ÄúWe follow a 60:40 ratio ‚Äì 60% fund is the wage component and 40% is for building materials. The wage component is [obtained] from MGNREGA and the rest ‚Ä¶ is shared with the Union ministry of women and child development and the state department.‚Äù

Thus Tumakuru alone has built 450 anganwadi centres using MGNREGA funds ‚Äì the highest in the state.

Data from the state department of women and child development suggests a large number of anganwadi centres still continue to function out of rented spaces, such as schools, community halls, etc., but the state expects to cover them under the convergence scheme in a phased manner.

But while the government has been modernising anganwadis and introducing new programmes, the workers say their demand for better pay remains unaddressed.

‚ÄúThe labour of women is never seen as labour, but viewed as a service,‚Äù Sylvia Karpagam, a public health doctor and researcher and a member of the ‚ÄòRight to Food‚Äô campaign in Karnataka, told The Wire. ‚ÄúThe language used in the context of their work is ‚Äòhonorarium‚Äô and not ‚Äòsalary‚Äô. This discrimination has to go and they should be treated as employees and not workers or helpers.‚Äù

Sundaramma has for the last decade been working as an anganwadi helper at Yerahalli village in H.D. Kote block, Mysuru. A short distance away, at the second anganwadi centre in Yerahalli, Nagaveni has been working as a helper for 17 years. Ask them if they‚Äôre satisfied with their salaries and they go quiet.

Gayathri, an anganwadi supervisor in H.D. Kote block, said she oversees a hundred anganwadi centres; Chandibai, a supervisor in Madhugiri block of Tumakuru, said she oversees 68 centres. The norm however is only 25 centres per supervisor.

In February 2019, anganwadi workers marched to the Parliament in Delhi to protest against the Centre‚Äôs reluctance to increase their pay and pension. In October the same year, anganwadi workers and helpers in Jharkhand protested demanding higher salaries.

In a country with such high malnutrition, it‚Äôs important to acknowledge the crucial role these women play as frontline health workers. Without them and their labour, the world‚Äôs largest programme to ensure good quality early childhood care and development would flop.

27,"Job Growth Data Shows Even 5,000 Years Not Enough to Structurally Transform Indian Economy","A long-run perspective can often produce insights that remain obscured in short-run analyses. Take the problem of employment generation in India. It is accepted by many academics and analysts that India has not been able to address the problem of employment in recent years. In fact, the problem is far worse than even such well-informed, pessimistic analyses would suggest. And given that policy discussions about the Indian economy are bound to pick up around the coming budget, this long-run perspective might be of some use.

To get at the enormity of the problem, let us adopt a long-run perspective like the pioneers of development economists. Following the seminal work of one such pioneer, W. Arthur Lewis, let us conceptualise the Indian economy as consisting of two segments. The first segment comprises what we can call the ‚Äòsubsistence economy‚Äô, while the second segment forms the ‚Äòmodern, capitalist economy‚Äô.

Productivity and incomes are far higher in the modern segment than in the subsistence segment. Hence, addressing the problem of underdevelopment means transferring the labour force from the subsistence to the modern segment of the economy. Development economists refer to this process as a ‚Äòstructural transformation‚Äô of the economy. The problem of employment will only begin to be meaningfully addressed when the Indian economy has completed its structural transformation.

Indian employment trends

According to the World Development Indicators Database of the World Bank, in 1990, India‚Äôs labour force was 317.68 million; by 2019, it had grown to 517.49 million in 2019. Thus, over these three decades, India‚Äôs labour force grew at 1.69% per year.

What fraction of India‚Äôs labour force is in what we have called the subsistence segment? To a first approximation, we can identify the subsistence segment with those who are informally employed. These are the workers who are employed in low-productivity, low-paying, precarious work ‚Äì without job security, without social security and with minimal rights.

Watch | Interview: ‚ÄòPopulist Economic Policies Must Go, Addressing Labour Income Urgent‚Äô: Nitin Desai

There is a lot of uncertainty about the exact distribution of the labour force into formal and informal employment. Estimates of informal employment range from 93% to 85% of total employment. To get as optimistic picture as possible, let us use an estimate that is lower than all existing ones ‚Äì so let us assume that the subsistence segment in India employs 80% of the labour force.

Before developing the argument further, an important issue needs to be addressed. Even in advanced capitalist economies like the United States, a small fraction of the labour force is informally employed ‚Äì these are the precariously employed, low-wage workers. In fact, the growing use of temporary, in the the place of permanent, employees has been a characteristic of the neoliberal era since the early 1980s. Thus, advanced capitalist economies have been witnessing a rise of precarious employment.

This troubling phenomenon possibly signals a reversal of the structural transformation that advanced capitalist countries had completed in the 2.5 decades after the Second World War ‚Äì a trend that has led some economists to even characterise the US economy as a dual economy, a term that is typically reserved for underdeveloped countries.

Taking this fact into consideration, let us conceive of the completion of structural transformation not as the complete disappearance of the subsistence segment, but rather its continued existence as a small portion of the total economy. Therefore, let us assume that 10% of employment will remain informal even in an economy that has completed structural transformation.

Structural transformation in the Indian economy

Let us now pose the main question. How fast must employment grow in the modern, capitalist segment for structural transformation to be completed in a reasonable period of time?

Also read: Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea

In Table 1, I compute the annual growth rate of employment in the modern capitalist segment that would be required to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy (when only 10% of employment will be in the subsistence segment) in 50, 100, 250, 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000 years. I compute the ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rate under two alternative scenarios: in the first scenario, the labour force grows at the rate that we have observed it to be growing over the last three decades; in the second, decidedly unrealistic, scenario, the labour force does not grow.

What do the numbers in Table 1 say? If the labour force continues to grow at the same rate at which it is currently growing, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 4.8% per annum to complete structural transformation of the Indian economy in 50 years. If the structural transformation is to be completed in 100 years, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 3.23% per annum. If, as is extremely unlikely, the labour force stops growing from this year onwards, employment in the modern capitalist segment must grow at 1.52% per annum to complete the structural transformation in 100 years.

To put these ‚Äòrequired‚Äô growth rates into perspective, we only need to ask: how fast has employment in the modern capitalist segment been growing in India over the past few decades? According to the Economic Survey of India, total employment in the private and public organised sectors of the Indian economy was 7.68 million and 19.06 million, respectively, in 1991; in 2011, the corresponding numbers were 11.42 million and 17.55 million, respectively. Thus, over the last two decades, employment in the modern segment (private + public) has grown at 0.48% per year and in the private sector of the modern segment at 2.13% per year.

Also read: Why the Wage Code is Unlikely to Improve the Conditions of Indian Workers

Returning, once again, to Table 1, we can now see the full meaning of the numbers: if the labour force and employment in the modern capitalist segment in India continues to grow at the currently observed long run rates of 1.69% and 0.48%, respectively, then the Indian economy will be unable to complete its structural transformation even in 5,000 years. If the labour force grows at the observed rate of 1.69% per year, and the modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for the private capitalist sector, i.e. 2.13% per year, then the Indian economy will complete its structural transformation in 357 years.

If the labour force stops growing altogether while the aggregate modern capitalist segment generates jobs at the rate observed for only the private capitalist sector, i.e. at 2.13% per year, both of which are extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future, even then Indian structural transformation will be completed in 72 years.

These absurdly large numbers should go some way in opening the eyes of those who have been all fired up by India‚Äôs economic performance in the past three decades. In substantive terms, these numbers convey the simple fact that without radical changes in policy orientation and the institutional setup, economic problems relating to the vast majority of the working population in India is here to stay for a long, long time.

Expectations were high, especially from the July budget, on taking urgent steps to address the alarming slide in economic growth. However, the document proved to be a self-destructing exercise. Several key decisions announced were either scaled back, watered down or just couldn‚Äôt get going.

But the burning question remains, for a country with a sizeable young population more than 600 million: What do the youth want from the Budget? And the answer is simple. Nothing. The youth want and need jobs.

An estimated 5 million people graduate out of college every year. More often than not, these young adults have neither a strong academic base, nor any special skills that make them immediately employable. So, armed with what should be a strong educational qualification, many are confined to jobs that are low on skill but offer the comfort of a fixed salary.

What is new and unnerving now is the overwhelming numbers of young people looking for employment on account of the changing demographics of the country. CMIE‚Äôs data indicates that in a state like Uttar Pradesh for instance, unemployment doubled from 5.91% in 2018 to 9.95% in 2019. Countrywide, graduates face a 17% unemployment rate.

There‚Äôs another, grimmer side to the story. Those who claim the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests are a one-off instance of youth activism are getting the signs completely wrong. While the context of the protests may be different, this outpouring is a culmination of issues, not a standalone event.

It started with vehement protests against fee hikes in JNU and other places. JNU has been protesting a 300% fee hike. Earlier in November, IIT Bombay and IIT-BHU protested against a 900% fee hike. Similar stories emerged from FTII and IIMC.

A direct rub-off

Many have criticised what they see as an entitled attitude by these young students. What may actually be taking place is a direct rub-off of the stories these aspiring job seekers saw and heard from their homes and towns.

As per the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey conducted by the National Statistical Office, the average monthly spending by an individual fell to Rs 1,446 in 2017-18 from Rs 1,501 in 2011-12, down 3.7%. It‚Äôs worse when you slice that for the rural-urban split. A Nomura report points out that rural households saw wage growth slip to a four-quarter low of 4% in 2019.

In a situation where households struggle to find enough to pay for basic supplies, education ‚Äì and the fees required to get it ‚Äì becomes both unattainable and unimportant.

The embers of student protest have become a full-fledged fire, as young students facing the possibility of low to no jobs find that their government wasn‚Äôt even paying lip service to the need for creating employment opportunities but instead were raising a completely different and to many, irrelevant issue.

Another standard deflection tool

In her maiden budget speech, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman claimed that the government is enabling millions to take up industry-relevant skill training and boosting their job prospects via the ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô initiative.

Here‚Äôs what the numbers say. An analysis of the unit-level data from the Periodic Labour Force Survey of 2017-18 shows only a small section of the youth reported receiving any vocational training. Nationally, only 1.8% of the population reported receiving formal vocational or technical training, while 5.6% reported receiving informal vocational training like self-learning. This means 93% of the population received no training, from either formal or informal sources.

Bear in mind, the youth comprised more than half of the people who received formal vocational or technical training.

The data also shows that a large share of them were either unemployed or out of the labour force. Ironically, 42% of the youth who did receive any formal technical training were not part of the labour force at all. And it goes without saying, across age groups, substantial shares of women who received such training were out of the labour force. The training itself was starkly different for men and women.

No skilling, no jobs and not enough disposable income to access either private skilling or education. India‚Äôs youth are angry. And now they are impatient.

So, while the Budget may be held up to question on many parameters ‚Äî fiscal health, poor revenues and kickstarting manufacturing ‚Äî for me the barometer is this: At the start of this decade, India needed 100 million jobs to meet its employment demands. As we step into 2020, India is facing the worst unemployment rate in over four decades. India‚Äôs youth want jobs. They want and deserve to feel secure about their living environment, about their educational institutes and about their economic prospects. Not another Budget speech."
29,India‚Äôs Politics and Economics Reflect a Simmering Crisis of Confidence and Mistrust,"The last few weeks have caused a few ripples in India‚Äôs political and economic landscape, reflecting the various shades of problems that our governance system is currently facing.

From the economic point of view, the government, acknowledging a state of crisis, announced yet another set of sector-specific measures. This time it was a Rs 10,000 crore relief package in the form of a ‚Äòspecial window fund‚Äô to revive India‚Äôs real estate industry, one of the worst affected sectors by the current slowdown.

There is little doubt that the real estate sector, which was once responsible for creating a massive number of jobs, is now witnessing an enduring liquidity-crunch. Some of this is likely due to the shock delivered by demonetisation. Nevertheless, the liquidity crunch has seriously impacted job creation in the construction sector, especially in the segments of residential and affordable housing.

The real estate‚Äôs poor performance over the past few years has also added to the deteriorating asset quality of India‚Äôs NBFCs, which has exacerbated the NPA problem. At the same time, due to a fall in demand for mid-income and affordable housing, credit demand for loans by property investors also dropped, resulting in a twin balance sheet problem for the banks.

A worsening bank crisis, evident in the collapse of IL&FS and PMC, has to some extent sparked fear amongst people who occupy the low and middle-income categories. This, in turn, brings down deposit holdings and limits the banking system‚Äôs credit creation powers.

With banks affected by a crisis of confidence, a problem that will involve some recovery time, it remains unclear how effective a supply-side measure like a special window fund can do to revive the real estate sector completely on its own. Especially considering this special measure is, by one estimate, likely to help less than 10% of the country‚Äôs stalled real estate projects. A wholesome, full-time solution requires a more constant credit-channel from India‚Äôs banks.

On the political side, in Maharashtra, we are seeing the Shiv Sena-BJP pre-poll alliance in almost on the verge of collapse. While the former was exploring an alternative political combination i.e. with NCP and Congress, to form a state government, president‚Äôs rule was imposed in the state. In Haryana too, the BJP‚Äôs vote share, to its own surprise, significantly declined due to the lacklustre economic conditions ‚Äì massive job loss and agrarian distress ‚Äì in the state.

The Ayodhya judgment

Amidst all these scenarios came the long overdue Ayodhya judgment by the Supreme Court which settled the 2.77 acre disputed land title case in favor of Ram Lalla and the Hindus to construct a temple there, while granting Muslims a 5 acre land allocated by the UP government for a mosque to be constructed elsewhere.

The judgment, even though decided and announced by India‚Äôs Supreme Court, needs to be viewed as a major ‚Äòpolitical event‚Äô that is principally aligned with the current ruling party‚Äôs vision to have a Ram temple constructed in Ayodhya at all costs. For Hindu fundamentalists, the judgment brings an actualisation of a major historical struggle for establishing religious precedence. It is hard not to see this in the larger context of the apex court announcing this at a time when its own credibility remains in serious doubt (we still haven‚Äôt had one hearing on the constitutionality of the Indian government‚Äôs action in Kashmir).

Also Read: Maharashtra Slips into President‚Äôs Rule Even with Hours Left of NCP‚Äôs ‚ÄòDeadline‚Äô

For now, in terms of its outlined manifesto goals, the BJP has so far emerged successful in achieving two of its three vital national objectives: the dilution of Article 370; having a Ram temple constructed at the disputed site in Ayodhya, with the third goal now, of creating a Uniform Civil Code (UCC), left to fulfil.

In the international scenario, India‚Äôs trade negotiations cohort (led by the prime minister himself), in an eleventh-hour decision, pulled out of joining the Regional and Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), citing its discontent with the nature of underlying trade agreement that failed to accommodate India‚Äôs principal concerns. This move was observed as a surprise by many commentators, considering how the minister of commerce and other members of the trade negotiators expressed a strong desire for India to be part of the plurilateral trade forum in the months leading up to the official meet in Bangkok.

A common underlying link

But, what seems to be a common underlying link emerging across some of these political and economic events in India‚Äôs recent past?

On a certain level, as Pratap Bhanu Mehta pointed recently, despite ‚Äúthe pantomime optimism‚Äù that the government and the media are trying to display, it is gradually ‚Äúbecoming impossible to disguise the sense of gloom surrounding the Indian economy‚Äù. The growth numbers and estimates at this point reflect exercises of statistical-fudging that mislead facts and fail to represent or forecast an authentic picture for India‚Äôs growth trajectory.

The connecting link, on a deeper level, points towards the fact that we are at a crossroads as with regard to the Indian government‚Äôs ability to lead the nation towards a progressive economic future. The political economic landscape, especially in the last five to six years has institutionalised this crisis of ‚Äòconfidence‚Äô where institutional credibility remains seriously doubted, whether of the RBI or the Supreme Court, as each action seems aligned with the propagandist agenda of the state or guided entirely by political goals rather than democratic or market principles.

A state election (like in Maharashtra) happens with two parties clearly declaring a pre-poll alliance but then parting ways right after the election. This event, of course, isn‚Äôt new in the history of Indian politics. Parties do break up after an election cycle. However, a culture of political inconsistency combined with normalisation of eroding voter-faith is almost becoming a norm, which will have serious impediments on how people vote (or don‚Äôt vote) in elections down the road.

On a larger international plank too, India‚Äôs own position and foreign image, as Ram Guha recently argued, has significantly been damaged post-New Delhi‚Äôs act to downgrade Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs status into two Union Territories and read down Article 370. This damage can be assessed in terms of India‚Äôs weakening democratic credentials ‚Äì a point echoed across US Congressional meetings, its presidential election announcements and in the foreign press.

The last-minute decision to pull out of the RCEP too doesn‚Äôt augur well with India‚Äôs diplomatic and economic policy push towards an Act East outlook. And, without a suitable alternative, this decision warrants a closer assessment in terms of India‚Äôs weakening trade competitiveness levels and diplomatic ability to negotiate agreements based on mutually beneficial market principles (after all this trade negotiation process was on for almost six years).

A crisis of confidence

In the context of the domestic economy too, a crisis of confidence is clear by observing levels of business and investor confidence. In fact, a recent data point indicates how there has been an increase in outward foreign direct investment levels from the private sector at a time when domestic demand remains dismally low along with the consumption demand. A higher outward FDI level in a weak domestic demand scenario simply indicates that the private sector players trust their investment abroad more than they do within India.

There is substantial economic evidence that argues how an atmosphere of systemic mistrust combined with a lack of confidence can adversely impact an economy‚Äôs growth rates by negatively impacting investment levels and business cycles. The logic is simple, as echoed by the Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller, who argues: ‚ÄúAn atmosphere generated by a steady flow and variety of lies is like a dark cloud over the facts. Businesses can‚Äôt plan effectively when they don‚Äôt know who or what can be trusted.‚Äù

Also Read: #RightSideUp: Ayodhya, Judgment Day

Mistrust in political functioning or leadership isn‚Äôt only affecting India but even countries like the US. In a recent article for the New York Times, Shiller explains how conditions of a persistent threat to American press amalgamated with the political dangers surfacing from a culture of lying under President Donald Trump, who feels free to attack all press against him as ‚Äúfake news‚Äù.

In India‚Äôs political landscape, a deep social polarisation on political action or events is a mirror reflection of this phenomenon. Being on the receiving side on this, I have personally observed a clear pattern of this, emerging from the ‚Äúanti-national‚Äù labelling of anyone with contrarian views or opinions to state-policy. This was even more explicit with all the chatter created right after New Delhi‚Äôs action on Kashmir. Some of the reactions on social media platform presented deeply troubling and resentful views not only against the Kashmiris but against anyone who advocated for the rights of Kashmiris.

Entrenched mistrust

Mistrust is further entrenched in society (and normalised) when the leadership promotes it. An illustration would be to recollect the demonetisation speech by the PM in November of 2016, and how right after, in another speech he passionately remarked: ‚ÄúI have asked the country for just 50 days. If after December 30, there are shortcomings in my work or there are mistakes or a bad intention found in my work, I will be prepared for the punishment that the country decides for me.‚Äù With the shock-move clearly failing and choking India‚Äôs growth engine, there hasn‚Äôt been any apology or official word on this since then.

At the same time, a form of violent verbal attitude ‚Äì shaped by a rhetorical axis of ‚Äòfor or against‚Äô, ‚Äòus vs them‚Äô ‚Äì is seen dividing a citizenry on key social, economic and political issues that have ramifications for the nation as a whole. And this has serious consequences for India‚Äôs own future and its credentials as a large democratic, market economy. It was ‚Äòtrust‚Äô in these very credentials which provided greater clarity and consistency to business communities ‚Äì within and outside India, to invest in India‚Äôs market (as do so in a severely authoritarian regime like China).

Watch | The Wire Business Report | India‚Äôs Job Crisis: Behind the Numbers with Mahesh Vyas

Trust and confidence are factors that are extremely difficult to measure or quantify. They have a social multiplier effect that drives an entire citizenry to work towards collective progress or regress. One needs to closely study and understand this effect: how a rise in mistrust or lack of confidence levels which is multiplying as a social phenomenon across countries like India, the US (to name a few) is affecting the citizenry at large?

There are deeper questions involved here about the political and economic psyche of an average citizen and how vulnerable she can be made when a strong state, as a matter of policy or law, pursues a polarising political agenda.

At the same time, from purely an economic lens, a fragile confidence in a political system will cause economic growth to fall. This is something that we perhaps are already seeing in India.

30,"9 Million Jobs Lost in 6 Years, a First in Indian History","New Delhi: A recent working paper published by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University has contested official claims on employment, showing an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù fall in total employment from 2011-12 to 2017-18.

Written by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K. Parida, the study says employment dropped by 9 million between these years ‚Äì ‚Äúfor the first time in India‚Äôs history‚Äù.

While these are not new observations, this is perhaps the first such formal study to establish through official data that total employment is declining and a reserve army of unemployed youth (both openly unemployed and disheartened) is rising ‚Äúmassively‚Äù. The study also shows a trend of increasing contractualisation in the both government and private jobs.

Also read: Troubling Unemployment Data, Leaked in January, Now Released Post-Elections

Though the share of regular and formal employment increased marginally overall, most jobs are still being generated by micro and small units of the unorganised and private sectors (68% of the total non-farm employment during 2017-18), the study found. The share of informal jobs has increased in the public sector as well, indicating a lack of decent government jobs.

Sector-wise decline

The agricultural sector registered a decline in employment at the rate of 4.5 million per annum (about 27 million in total) during 2011-12 and 2017-18. The share of employment in the agricultural and allied sector declined from 49 to about 44%.

The labour-intensive manufacturing sector registered a decline of 3.5 million jobs. The share of manufacturing in total employment has thus gone down from 12.6 to 12.1% ‚Äì in fact, manufacturing jobs have fallen for the first time in India‚Äôs history. It‚Äôs not just a decline in growth rate but in absolute numbers too.

The authors note that, ‚Äúfalling manufacturing jobs is the opposite of the goal of ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô, and the opposite of what is desirable if the process of structural transformation is to be sustained‚Äù.

There‚Äôs a slowdown in construction job growth. Non-manufacturing jobs (mostly construction) which created about 4 million jobs every year from 2004-05 to 2011-12 created only about 0.6 million per annum during 2011-12 and 2017-18.

Also read: NSSO Data Puts Unemployment at 45-Year High in 2017-18: Report

The only sector to witness sustained job growth (3 million per annum) was services. There has been a 17.3 million rise in regular salaried workers in this sector during 2011-12 and 2017-18. However, the quality of jobs in this sector are mostly poor.

The study says:

‚ÄúWhile falling total and youth employment in agriculture is good news from the structural transformation point of view, falling manufacturing employment and decelerating construction employment growth are bad news for the economy, which moved up to lower middle income status just over a decade ago. To sustain the growth of income, improve standard of living, and to reduce poverty, employment opportunities in manufacturing and construction (although a transitory sector) is necessary. Because this would not only sustain the structural transformation process, it would also help sustain growth of GDP over the long run.‚Äù

Speaking to The Wire, Mehrotra said that the number of entrants into the labour force has been increasing since 2011-12, it was very small between 2004-05 and 2011-12 (only 2 million per annum). The number has risen after that in the last six years to roughly 5 million per annum. At the same time, non-agricultural job growth has declined. When these facts are combined, it indicates that there is an increase in the open unemployment rate. The supply of labour is increasing while the demand for it is decreasing.

According to The Indian Express, this result is ‚Äúin stark contrast to the recent study by Laveesh Bhandari and Amaresh Dubey, which was commissioned by the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister‚Äù. This study had claimed that total employment grew from 433 million in 2011-12 to 457 million in 2017-18.

The latest study by Mehrotra and Parida, however, says that employment fell from 474 million in 2011-12 to 465 million in 2017-18.

A major reason for this difference could be because the estimates for 2004-05 and 2011-12 in the study by Bhandari and Dubey (412 million and 433 million respectively) are much lower than that in Mehrotra and Parida (459 and 474). Mehrotra believes that it‚Äôs almost certainly because they have used only Usual Principal Status (UPS) and not Usual Principal and Subsidiary Status (UPSS) in their calculations.

Under UPS, a person is considered part of the labour force if s/he works for 183 days or more in a year. Under UPSS, a person who has worked even for 30 days in a year is considered employed.

Also read: The Slowdown is Real and We Need More than Brave Faces and Silly Alibis to Fix Things

However, for the 2017-18 figure, both the studies seem to have used both principal and subsidiary status as the results are very close (457 and 465 respectively).

Real wages, which were increasing from 2004-05 to 2011-12 because of job growth (Mehrotra says 7.5 million new non-agricultural jobs were being created at a time when fewer people were entering the labour force), have stagnated or fell. ‚ÄúWe have gone back to the period of 1996-2004 in terms of real wages, they‚Äôre flat or they‚Äôve fallen,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Though the study only draws inferences from the study as the final conclusion can only be arrived at when the consumer expenditure survey is out. The authors‚Äô inference is that poverty has not declined in the last six years.

Even though the latest official consumption survey is not out yet, Himanshu, associate professor at JNU‚Äôs Centre for Economic Studies and Planning compared two Periodic Labour Force Surveys in 2014-15 and 2017-18 and found that the consumption expenditure of rural and urban Indian households has been falling. ‚ÄúWe know from macro data that private consumption as a proportion of the GDP has actually fallen in the last 6 years, and household savings have fallen very sharply. When you put that together, it is very clear that stagnation in real wages is showing up in declining expenditure and a fall in household savings,‚Äù Mehrotra says.

Also read: Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking

The study also shows that there has been some improvement in the share of informal workers in the total workforce ‚Äì it has gone down from 93% to 90.7%. Informal workers are defined as those who have no death and disability insurance and old age pension. The reasons for his decline could be due to factors like the government paying the workers‚Äô share of EPFO contributions for three years and increase in registration of firms due under GST (which could have encouraged EPFO registration as well).

Within the organised sector, however, there is an interesting paradox ‚Äì the share of those who have social security has increased in the organised sector, reversing an erstwhile trend, but the number of workers with short term contracts has also gone up.

In conclusion, the authors suggest a comprehensive employment policy combined with an industrial policy ‚Äúto address agrarian transformation, boost real wages in rural areas, ensure industrial development, taking skill issues into consideration‚Äù."
31,"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

Also read: ‚ÄòHow Can Centre Reopen 50,000 Temples in Valley, When There Are Only 4,000 in J&K?‚Äô

He added that after assurances from the DC Srinagar, they have submitted proposals to him for helping the company get new clients. ‚ÄúWe are very hopeful that we will get business for the company. I am personally working with Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and we are discussing how to solve this issue. So far we have conducted several meetings with him in the presence of other officials. We are hopeful that we will get more business, so that no one will lose their jobs.‚Äù

According to Nissar, when they started this unit, the site‚Äôs infrastructure and setup was poor. They have changed that over the years and now business was doing well. ‚ÄúThis office is like my child. I have a very personal attachment to it and in all these years, we all have worked so hard that I cannot see it in this phase.‚Äù

However, employees working with the company are not seeing anything happen. ‚ÄúWe have been waiting for weeks. Like many promises from the government, we don‚Äôt think this will come true for us,‚Äù said an employee who was standing at the AEGIS gate to meet his colleague.

The ongoing clampdown has hit businesses across sectors. Tourism, which is considered to be the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs economy, is going through its one of its worst phases yet.

Finding no income in the last 64 days, hotel and houseboat owners have laid off their staffers. There are more than 1,200 houseboats registered in Srinagar, and each houseboat had two helpers. Now, 90% of the workers on these houseboats have lost their jobs.

‚ÄúI used to work on the HB Fairy houseboat. With no work left there, my employer told me to go home. I have small children back at home and it is becoming difficult for me to feed them. Yanhan gunda gardi chalti hai, jo mann main aata hai, karte hain. Bhugta kaun hai, hum jaise gareeb (There is authoritarianism here. Whatever they want for themselves, they do that. It is the poor people like me who become victims of such decisions),‚Äù said 33-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Bhat from Srinagar‚Äôs Buchwara, on the Dal Lake.

The most common worry is how to manage daily expenses. A worker standing next to Bhat said, ‚ÄúDo they have any idea of the problems facing a common man here? No. If that would have been the case, they would not have chosen this. We have families, small children. I don‚Äôt have money even to buy diapers for my son.‚Äù

Unofficial lay offs

People like Bhat and Tariq know that their jobs are gone, and have very little hope of getting them back. But others, who work for private firms, are still unsure of what the future holds for them. Employees of one of the most renowned private automobile outlets, Jamkash Vehicles which deals in Maruti cars, are now feeling the heat. The dealership has 1,400 employees in six different outlets across the Valley.

Employees‚Äô attendance has not been maintained for the last month in Jamkash Vehicles‚Äô main branch in Hyderpora, Srinagar. ‚ÄúThere are chances that they will reduce nearly 50% of their staff if the situation does not improve. Although they have not given us any official notification, it is certain,‚Äù said a senior employee, wishing not to be named.

Having worked for the company for more than 14 years, he told The Wire that if the company does, it is only the workers who will be in trouble. ‚ÄúThere is huge unemployment here and when normalcy returns, the company will hire new workers. It is not a big deal for them. Their main concern is business ‚Äì if you are providing them that, you are safe. If you failed to do it, you will be shown the door.‚Äù

According to an employee working with Rising Kashmir, a Srinagar-based daily, the newspaper has also laid off staff members. ‚ÄúRabiya Bashir, Ishfaq Amin, Sahil Iqbal and Ishfaq Ahmad were told to stop work. Facing a financial crisis in this continuous clampdown, the organisation was not able to pay them. It‚Äôs a sad decision but what are the options? I am feeling bad for them.‚Äù

A journalist at Greater Kashmir, wishing not to be named, told The Wire that they have been told by the HR that the organisation has decided on a new policy for its employees: ‚ÄúNo work, no pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, since this is communication blockade, many district reporters were not able to send their stories. This decision has mostly hit district reporters who are working on meagre salaries,‚Äù he said.

With no improvement in the circumstances in sight, many weekly news magazines and online portals in the Valley are facing tremendous losses on a daily basis.

32,"On Manmohan Singh's Birthday, Congress Renews Unemployment Charge Against BJP Govt","New Delhi: The Congress on Thursday harnessed the occasion of former prime minister Manmohan Singh‚Äôs birthday to highlight rising unemployment and falling education levels in India.

Since morning, the party‚Äôs social media handles were rife with multiple tributes to Singh. Its national spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, meanwhile, addressed the press to present the recently-released economic and higher education indicators that would reportedly substantiate the claim that the BJP-led Union government has left the country in a poor state.

Surjewala quoted figures from two reports: the 8th Annual All India Survey on Higher Education, 2018-19 released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), and the Unemployment in India: A Statistical Profile released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

Unemployment

The Congress leader said that at 8.19% in August, 2019, the unemployment rate in India in perhaps the highest since Independence. The August figure shows further deterioration from 7.03% in May 2019, which it was itself the highest in the last 50 years.

Surjewala also pointed out that the figures are much higher than the global average of 4.95% declared by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).

The current global average unemployment rate is 4.95% & as per the latest CMIE report India‚Äôs unemployment rate is nearly double that amount at 7.46%. And the BJP govt. still claims we‚Äôre the fast growing economy in the world. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/JWK3pl0lM5 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

He also pointed out at the gender break up of the problem. ‚ÄúWhile the unemployment rate among men is 6%, it is 17.5% among women. This is the reality of the union government‚Äôs Beti Padhao, Beti Bachao mission.‚Äù

The rate of unemployment for men is 6.1% while that among women is more than double i.e. 17.5%. This is the reality of the ‚ÄòBeti Bachao Beti Padhao‚Äô Govt: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/Vd2FCdHkL6 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Both rural & urban unemployment have risen in the last four months but in all the ‚Äúbudgets‚Äù presented our FM @nsitharaman there is no policy to address the growing unemployment crisis. #BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/XH6PJ0oXrk ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019

Another staggering conclusion the CMIE report highlights, Surjewala said, is that the current unemployment rate is almost three times higher than the global average among those who are graduates or more. Almost 15% of those highly-educated people who are actively looking for a job are unable to find one.

‚ÄúThe report says that more than one young people are without a job now. In reality, however, the number may be much more,‚Äù said the Congress leader.

Unemployment level jumps to 15% among those who are graduates and above. This is three times the international average. Currently more than one crore youth are unemployed: @rssurjewala#BerozgaarBharat pic.twitter.com/70hbYS3kg8 ‚Äî Congress (@INCIndia) September 26, 2019



Education

The MHRD report, the Congress leader said, throws up even more troubling statistics.

‚ÄúThe government in its own report admits that 74% among the youth, between 18 and 23 years, are not enrolled in colleges at the moment.

‚ÄúOnly 2.5% colleges in India are admitting students in PhD programmes. As many as 35% of the total colleges have only one single programme. And to top it all, 83% of the total number of colleges in India are privately managed. What has happened to the responsibility of the government which claimed to provide world-class education to all?‚Äù Surjewala asked.

He added that only 8.5% of the total number of teachers are from Scheduled Caste communities, which means that even the minimum guaranteed reservation system is not being implemented properly.

‚ÄúBJP and the present government has turned India‚Äôs demographic dividend into a demographic disaster because of their disastrous policies. A government that continues to say ‚Äòeverything is fine‚Äô should think a little more,‚Äù he said, adding that it is ‚Äútime for the prime minister to look beyond stage-managed programmes.‚Äù

He said that the prime minister should now start addressing the most pertinent question the youth of India is asking, that is ‚ÄúHowdy, Education, Howdy, Unemployment‚Äù.

He also said that in the 10 years the UPA was in the government, the unemployment rate had never shot up like this.

Earlier in the day, Congress took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. While posting a video on Manmohan Singh, it described him as ‚Äúthe leader other leaders love‚Äù.

Sonia Gandhi, the party‚Äôs interim president, also wished the former prime minister on his birthday, recalled his contributions, and said, ‚ÄúPresent day rulers across the spectrum have much to learn from his innate wisdom.‚Äù"
33,North India's Unemployment Woes Due to Lack of Qualified Candidates: Labour Minister,"New Delhi: Union labour minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar stirred controversy on Sunday after indicating that the employment crisis in North Indian states was not due to a lack of jobs, but that recruiting companies could not find enough qualified candidates.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments attracted criticism from opposition politicians but also shine an unflattering spotlight on the Skill India project, a massive initiative that comes under the skill development ministry and works closely with the labour ministry.

Over the past four years, both supporters and critics of the Centre have pointed out flaws in the flagship Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana (PMKVY), which was supposed to align the capabilities of India‚Äôs youth to the requirements of India Inc.

‚ÄúThe issue of employment keep figuring in newspapers these days. I am handling the same ministry for labour and employment and examine the issue daily. I have understood the problem,‚Äù Gangwar told reporters on Saturday in Bareilly, his Lok Sabha constituency.

‚ÄúRecruiters who visit north India complain of facing dearth of quality people for the posts they need to fill,‚Äù he added.

According to the latest India Skill Report (2019), which is backed by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), only a little over of 45% of youth graduating from educational institutions are employable.

Earlier this year, data released by the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) also indicated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate may have been the highest in over 40 years at 6.1% in 2017-18.

Gangwar‚Äôs comments, therefore, come as salt in the wound for a festering problem. In October 2018, The Wire had reported of top level exits at the National Skill Development Corporation (NSDC), a problem that indicated not all is well with Skill India.

The minister‚Äôs remarks drew sharp reactions from opposition with Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra saying the government was trying to escape blame for the job losses due to economic slowdown by such ‚Äúinsulting‚Äù comments.

‚ÄúMr Minister, it has been more than five years for your government. There is no job creation. Whatever jobs were there, they have been snatched due to the economic slowdown brought by the government. You want to escape by insulting North Indians,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúYouths are looking towards the government hoping that it will do something good for them,‚Äù the Congress general secretary said.

Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati said such comments are laughable.

‚ÄúAfter the different laughable statements by different Union ministers on the serious issue of economic slowdown, instead of removing unemployment in the country now it is being said that there is no shortage of jobs, but of competence, especially amongst north Indians.

‚ÄúThis is extremely shameful and an apology should be tendered to the nation,‚Äù she tweeted.

Clarification?

In an apparent clarification made to news agency ANI, Gangwar, who is a minister of state with independent charge, said that he was trying to paint a different context.

There was a lack of skill and the government has opened a skill ministry so children can be trained as per the job requirement, he said.

34,"Centre Said It Was Bringing Jobs to J&K. Instead, It Has Brought More Unemployment","Srinagar: The Modi government‚Äôs decision to scrap Article 370 of the constitution ‚Äì which it claimed would bring new professional opportunities and peace to the Kashmir Valley ‚Äì has left scores of people without the jobs they already had.

The continuing clampdown on movement and communication has forced companies to wind up their units. Many have cut as much as 50% of their staff strength, because they have had no business since August 5.

Among them is AEGIS, a multinational company that deals with customer care services. In 2006, it had opened an office in Rangreth, Srinagar. Now, the company has decided to close this branch, which employed close to 70 people.

On August 12, employees at AEGIS‚Äôs Srinagar branch were given two days off for Eid. On August 16, when they arrived at the office, the company has stopped its operations.

‚ÄúFrom morning to afternoon, we were waiting for calls to come. We thought there might be a technical issue. Later, we were called by the head of the unit (Suhail Nissar) to his office. He informed us that the company has stopped its business,‚Äù said 26-year-old Younis Tariq, a customer care executive at the firm.

He further told The Wire, ‚ÄúWe were shocked by the announcement. The CEO of the company was on video call and he announced this decision. He told us that the company will pay us 1.5 months salary, which they later extended to three months. They said this branch was not bringing them any revenue.‚Äù

Standing in the office courtyard, he said the two-day off for Eid had made staff members suspicious. ‚ÄúWe were never given two days off since we started working with this company. This was a sudden decision, and we were not given any information about it.‚Äù

According to the staff members, the company has decided to shift its Srinagar operations to branches in Lucknow and Bhopal.

‚ÄúThey transferred the Srinagar centre‚Äôs work to Bhopal. They gave us two options ‚Äì either choose a transfer, or file a proper resignation and take three months‚Äô salary. But a transfer would have been difficult, because they were not raising our salaries and on this salary, it would have been hard for us to manage there,‚Äù said Tariq, with a sense of helplessness.

He explained why leaving the Valley for a job was not an option for him. ‚ÄúMy current salary was Rs 13,000 and if I shift to any other state, my moving expenditure would be around Rs 10,000.‚Äù

The employees approached the government with their predicament. Deputy commissioner of Srinagar Shahid Iqbal Choudhary reportedly assured them that he would take care of their grievances.

‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòWe have many projects in the government sector and I will surely try to provide business to the organisation so that you won‚Äôt lose your jobs‚Äô. But it has been almost one month since he made his promise, and we are not seeing any changes from their side,‚Äù Tariq told The Wire.

According to him, Choudhary has also told them that if AEGIS will not provide give them salaries, he would make other arrangements.

‚ÄúWe are coming each day to the office as per our schedule. However, the company is not taking our attendance into consideration. We are coming regularly with the hope that things might go back to normal,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe did not agree to their offer. We want a job, not just three-months salary.‚Äù

Aamir Shafi Sheikh, who works for Shara Info as a software developer, said that the company has cut 50% of employees‚Äô salaries because they cannot operate without the internet in Kashmir. They have been told that if the situation does not improve, the company will close.

‚ÄúWe are coming to office every day, but can‚Äôt do any work because there‚Äôs no internet. The company may follow AEGIS‚Äôs decision. If they do this, we will just have to sit at home,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary, the bureaucrat who has assumed the role of the government‚Äôs crisis manager, told The Wire that official plans have been drawn up based on proposals submitted by AEGIS BPO on September 14, 2019, after preliminary discussions between the management and the government.

He further said that companies have to arrange business both from the government and private sector. ‚ÄúOn our side, a meeting under the chairmanship of the chief secretary was convened. The district administration on September 23, 2019 has approved the proposal for a Grievance Redressal Cell, with a budget of Rs 60 lakh. Three other proposals are in the pipeline,‚Äù he said.

Choudhary also stated that the government has already come up with a policy to aid the establishment of new BPOs and sustain existing ones. The private sector too has to come in, he said. ‚ÄúThe government is doing whatever possible. I am sure once these things are incorporated in an annual plan, which is under formulation, things will be better. We are exploring more services which could be outsourced by the government sector,‚Äù he said.

The head of AEGIS Srinagar, Suhail Nissar, told The Wire that clients associated with the company did not want to continue their business, and this has affected their work. He added that being a multi-national company and keeping the situation in mind, they have offered two options to their employees. ‚Äú[We] offered that they either go for transfers or take three months‚Äô salary. But the demand from employees was that they want a job. Later, they approached the media and DC Srinagar about this issue,‚Äù said Nissar.

Also read: ‚ÄòHow Can Centre Reopen 50,000 Temples in Valley, When There Are Only 4,000 in J&K?‚Äô

He added that after assurances from the DC Srinagar, they have submitted proposals to him for helping the company get new clients. ‚ÄúWe are very hopeful that we will get business for the company. I am personally working with Shahid Iqbal Choudhary and we are discussing how to solve this issue. So far we have conducted several meetings with him in the presence of other officials. We are hopeful that we will get more business, so that no one will lose their jobs.‚Äù

According to Nissar, when they started this unit, the site‚Äôs infrastructure and setup was poor. They have changed that over the years and now business was doing well. ‚ÄúThis office is like my child. I have a very personal attachment to it and in all these years, we all have worked so hard that I cannot see it in this phase.‚Äù

However, employees working with the company are not seeing anything happen. ‚ÄúWe have been waiting for weeks. Like many promises from the government, we don‚Äôt think this will come true for us,‚Äù said an employee who was standing at the AEGIS gate to meet his colleague.

The ongoing clampdown has hit businesses across sectors. Tourism, which is considered to be the backbone of Jammu and Kashmir‚Äôs economy, is going through its one of its worst phases yet.

Finding no income in the last 64 days, hotel and houseboat owners have laid off their staffers. There are more than 1,200 houseboats registered in Srinagar, and each houseboat had two helpers. Now, 90% of the workers on these houseboats have lost their jobs.

‚ÄúI used to work on the HB Fairy houseboat. With no work left there, my employer told me to go home. I have small children back at home and it is becoming difficult for me to feed them. Yanhan gunda gardi chalti hai, jo mann main aata hai, karte hain. Bhugta kaun hai, hum jaise gareeb (There is authoritarianism here. Whatever they want for themselves, they do that. It is the poor people like me who become victims of such decisions),‚Äù said 33-year-old Aijaz Ahmad Bhat from Srinagar‚Äôs Buchwara, on the Dal Lake.

The most common worry is how to manage daily expenses. A worker standing next to Bhat said, ‚ÄúDo they have any idea of the problems facing a common man here? No. If that would have been the case, they would not have chosen this. We have families, small children. I don‚Äôt have money even to buy diapers for my son.‚Äù

Unofficial lay offs

People like Bhat and Tariq know that their jobs are gone, and have very little hope of getting them back. But others, who work for private firms, are still unsure of what the future holds for them. Employees of one of the most renowned private automobile outlets, Jamkash Vehicles which deals in Maruti cars, are now feeling the heat. The dealership has 1,400 employees in six different outlets across the Valley.

Employees‚Äô attendance has not been maintained for the last month in Jamkash Vehicles‚Äô main branch in Hyderpora, Srinagar. ‚ÄúThere are chances that they will reduce nearly 50% of their staff if the situation does not improve. Although they have not given us any official notification, it is certain,‚Äù said a senior employee, wishing not to be named.

Having worked for the company for more than 14 years, he told The Wire that if the company does, it is only the workers who will be in trouble. ‚ÄúThere is huge unemployment here and when normalcy returns, the company will hire new workers. It is not a big deal for them. Their main concern is business ‚Äì if you are providing them that, you are safe. If you failed to do it, you will be shown the door.‚Äù

According to an employee working with Rising Kashmir, a Srinagar-based daily, the newspaper has also laid off staff members. ‚ÄúRabiya Bashir, Ishfaq Amin, Sahil Iqbal and Ishfaq Ahmad were told to stop work. Facing a financial crisis in this continuous clampdown, the organisation was not able to pay them. It‚Äôs a sad decision but what are the options? I am feeling bad for them.‚Äù

A journalist at Greater Kashmir, wishing not to be named, told The Wire that they have been told by the HR that the organisation has decided on a new policy for its employees: ‚ÄúNo work, no pay.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnfortunately, since this is communication blockade, many district reporters were not able to send their stories. This decision has mostly hit district reporters who are working on meagre salaries,‚Äù he said.

With no improvement in the circumstances in sight, many weekly news magazines and online portals in the Valley are facing tremendous losses on a daily basis. An owner of the online news portal, requesting anonymity, told The Wire, ‚ÄúSince August 5, we are not able to publish a single story.

35,Congress Leaders Amp Pressure on Govt Over Economy,"New Delhi: Congress on Saturday attacked the BJP government over the slump in the GDP, with party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra demanding that the Centre clarify who is responsible for ‚Äúdestroying‚Äù the economy.

Priyanka on Twitter said the government that trumpeted of bringing achche din (‚Äògood days‚Äô) has now ‚Äúpunctured‚Äù the economy.

‚ÄúThe GDP growth rate clearly shows that the government trumpeting about ‚Äòachche din‚Äô has punctured the state of the economy. Neither is GDP growth high nor is the rupee strong and jobs are being lost. Now clarify as to whose action has destroyed the economy,‚Äù she said in a tweet in Hindi.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growth to over six-year low of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2019-20, according to official data released on Friday.

36,"What Explains India's Shadow Banking Crisis, and What Can Be Done Now?","The ongoing liquidity crisis in India‚Äôs shadow banking sector is intensifying. The troubles that started with defaults by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS) last year are far from over, as the sector continues to face a severe liquidity crisis. If tight liquidity conditions persist in the next financial year, it may turn into a solvency issue for several shadow banks.

After the IL&FS collapse, the entire sector is facing a crisis of confidence. Investors are shying away from investing in securities issued by shadow banks. Several shadow banks are finding it difficult to raise money from banks, mutual funds and the rest of the financial system for either funding their growth or rollover of existing short-term debt. Some are resorting to asset monetisation to meet their immediate repayment obligations.

Leave aside those shadow banks that have weak financial profiles; even financially sound and better-governed entities are facing a liquidity squeeze. Most shadow banks have reduced disbursement of loans to preserve liquidity.

After growing aggressively in the last three years, the credit disbursals by shadow banks have fallen by almost a third this year. Consequently, lending to housing, automobile, consumer durables and small businesses has substantially reduced. In sectors such as housing and automobile, shadow banks play a vital role in loan financing. The reduced availability of funding has contributed to the slowdown in these sectors.

Also read: How a Shadow Banking Crisis Sent India‚Äôs Autos Sector Into a Tailspin

In particular, the automobile sector has been badly hit by the ongoing liquidity crisis as shadow banks were the leading financiers of commercial vehicles, passenger cars and two-wheelers in India. Before the onset of the liquidity crisis, close to 40% of new auto loans were issued by shadow banks. According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, passenger car sales declined by 26% in April-July 2019 over the same period last year. Close to 300 dealer showrooms of passenger vehicles have shut down across India in the last one year as shadow banks have stopped financing vehicle purchase, while automakers have either cut production or shut production plants temporarily to keep inventory in check. Analysts estimate that tens of thousands of jobs in India‚Äôs auto sector are at risk if the slump in the automobile sector continues.

Since commercial banks are still struggling with high levels of non-performing assets, they are not rushing in to fill the void left by the shadow banks. Rather, commercial banks may also like to reduce their exposure to stressed sectors such as automobile and housing to improve their balance sheets. All these developments in the financial sector will have serious ramifications on the overall economy as the bulk of India‚Äôs economic growth is driven by domestic demand.

DHFL: The new poster boy of the liquidity crisis

Since September 2018, hardly a week passes without more bad news about the cash-strapped Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL). On August 16, DHFL again defaulted on its repayment obligations worth Rs 15.7 billion on non-convertible debentures and commercial papers. Nothing new as the company has not been able to meet most of its debt repayment obligations since June 2019, but this was the largest default by the DHFL till date.

DHFL has a total debt liability of Rs 850 billion as of June 2019, out of which secured loans stood at Rs 749 billion while the rest is unsecured. The company posted a net loss of Rs 22 billion in the fourth quarter of 2018-2019.

The company‚Äôs lending business has virtually come to a standstill, with no fresh disbursements of loans in the last six months. The series of defaults have made it almost impossible for the company to raise new money from the financial markets.

In July, while announcing the fourth-quarter financial results, the company admitted that it is ‚Äúundergoing substantial financial stress‚Äù and its ability to raise funds was ‚Äúsubstantially impaired and the business has been brought to a standstill with there being minimal/virtually no disbursements‚Ä¶ These developments may raise a significant doubt on the ability of the company to continue as a going concern.‚Äù

Also read: How Should India Resolve the Fault Lines in its Shadow Banking System?

Of late, DHFL sold its stake in non-core businesses to meet some of its repayment obligations, but it has not been able to find suitable buyers for a majority equity stake in the company. So far, investors have only shown interest in buying portions of its asset portfolio.

Earlier this month, the company approached the consortium of lenders with a resolution plan that includes conversion of debt to equity, a moratorium on repayments, and new credit lines to start fresh lending. The bankers are now discussing the resolution plan. Currently, the Wadhawan family controls DHFL, with a 39.21% stake in the company. If the lenders accept the resolution plan, they may also demand to replace the company‚Äôs management because in January, online news portal CobraPost raised allegations that DHFL created shell companies to divert funds worth Rs 31 billion.

After the IL&FS collapse, DHFL is the second large-sized shadow bank on the verge of bankruptcy. With so much public money at stake, banks, mutual funds, pension funds and insurance companies are all keen to avoid bankruptcy at DHFL.

A belated regulatory response

In the past two months, several regulatory measures have been announced by the Ministry of Finance and the Reserve Bank of India. Some of the regulatory measures were long overdue. For instance, returning the regulatory authority over the housing finance sector from National Housing Bank to the RBI is a welcome move, provided the staff strength of RBI is suitably increased to undertake both onsite inspections and off-site surveillance of housing finance companies that constitute a major segment of India‚Äôs shadow banking sector.

Another notable development is that the RBI is now empowered to remove any director and supersede the board of directors of shadow banks ‚Äúin the public interest or to prevent the affairs of a nonbanking financial company being conducted in a manner detrimental to the interest of the depositors or creditors, or financial stability or for securing the proper management of such company.‚Äù

Besides, the RBI has been given powers to remove or debar auditors if they fail to conduct their role correctly. The financial penalties are also enhanced if the shadow banks don‚Äôt implement the regulatory measures.

The RBI has recently cancelled registrations of 1,851 shadow banks that could not raise even Rs 20 million to meet the minimum regulatory requirements. One wonders why such entities were permitted to run a shadow bank in the first place?

What about carrots?

Both the finance ministry and the RBI have announced several policy measures to ease liquidity pressure in the shadow banking sector. However, the effectiveness of these measures remains to be seen. These include an increase in any bank‚Äôs single-exposure limit to a single shadow bank from the existing 15% to 20% of tier-1 capital; priority sector lending status for credit to shadow banks for on-lending to agriculture, SMEs and housing; and reduced risk-weights for consumer loans.

In her Union Budget speech on July 5, the finance minister provided a one-time six months‚Äô partial credit guarantee to public sector banks for the first loss of up to 10% to purchase high-rated pooled assets from financially sound shadow banks amounting to Rs 1 trillion. It is too early to assess the impact of this measure as its operational guidelines have been issued on August 13, but the fact remains that this one-time facility is only meant for ‚Äúfinancially sound‚Äù shadow banks. In other words, the least risky shadow banks (such as HDFC and LIC Housing Finance) will benefit from this facility, not the cash-starved weaker entities such as DHFL and Reliance Capital.

On August 23, Nirmala Sitharaman announced additional liquidity support of Rs 200 billion to housing finance companies to be provided by the National Housing Bank, as part of a stimulus package. The minister also announced that public sector banks (PSBs) would fast track collaborations with shadow banks for loans to SMEs, small traders and microfinance institutions under the co-origination scheme introduced in last August by the RBI. Under this scheme, shadow banks will take a minimum of 20% of the credit risk by way of direct exposure while the co-originating PSB will take the rest of the credit risk.

This scheme allows shadow banks to expand their business and thereby book profits with little investments while the PSBs can meet their priority sector targets of lending to such sectors, albeit with higher credit risks. At the time of writing, there is no information available about the volume of loans disbursed under the co-origination scheme. As there are better and safer options available to the PSBs to achieve priority sector lending targets, they may not be willing to collaborate with ailing shadow banks unless they are forced to do so by New Delhi.

More importantly, it raises a pertinent question: why encourage public sector banks to increase lending to shadow banks? And particularly at a time when the capital-constrained PSBs already have considerable exposure to troubled shadow banks (such as DHFL and Reliance Capital) and are currently struggling to repair their balance sheets from the NPA crisis? Such policy moves would make public sector banks more vulnerable as the potential risks in the shadow banks will spillover to banks. PSBs account for nearly 70% of India‚Äôs banking sector and therefore raise potential financial stability concerns.

Rather, the strategy should be to ring-fence the current liquidity crisis in the shadow banking sector and thereby prevent the problems spilling over into the Indian banking sector.

In China and elsewhere, the authorities are trying to break the interlinkages between the shadow banks and banks to ensure the contagion risks arising out of a failure of large shadow banks in the banking sector are contained, and overall financial stability is preserved.

To restore the investors‚Äô confidence, the RBI should undertake the asset quality review of India‚Äôs shadow banks to bring all problems to the fore, similar to what the RBI conducted for commercial banks in 2015.

An inherent problem with the business model of shadow banks is their over-reliance on short-term funding to fund longer-term assets. To finance infrastructure and long-term industrial projects, New Delhi should set up specialised development finance institutions with explicit public policy mandates and higher standards of transparency and accountability.

37,"Ground Report | In Leh, Celebrations Give Way to Concerns over Land and Job Protections","Leh: On the eve of India‚Äôs 73rd Independence Day, and almost ten days after the announcement that Ladakh will be separated from Kashmir to become a union territory and the state‚Äôs special status will be removed, an air of jubilation hung in the picturesque town of Leh in one of the country‚Äôs most sparsely populated districts ‚Äì Ladakh.

A group of youngsters gathered at the main market in Leh to put up a banner reading ‚ÄòUnion Territory of Ladakh celebrates its 1st Independence Day‚Äô. All of them preferred anonymity. ‚ÄúIndependence from Kashmir,‚Äù explained one of them. ‚ÄúFor too long, we have been neglected by leaders from Kashmir who have only focused on the Valley.‚Äù

The next morning, as the flag hoisting ceremony was about to begin in Leh‚Äôs Polo Ground, patriotic songs from Hindi films blared from industrial-strength speakers. Each song was followed by cries of ‚ÄòBharat Mata ki Jai‚Äô and ‚ÄòJai Hind‚Äô from the master of ceremonies and the ever-increasing crowd.

‚ÄúIt is a very happy moment for us. It is a dream come true,‚Äù said Tsering Namdan, who was looking forward to the Independence Day ceremony and was particularly excited to catch a glimpse of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, former captain of the Indian cricket team, who, rumour went, would be present for the flag hoisting ceremony as part of his 15-day deployment with the territorial army.

‚ÄúWe have been demanding UT (union territory) status for 70 years and are very thankful to Narendra Modi and Amit Shah that they have fulfilled our demand. Now, we can look forward to fast-paced development,‚Äù Namdan said.

The demand for union territory status in Ladakh dates back to 1949. ‚ÄúWe have always held that we want to be separated from Jammu and Kashmir,‚Äù P.T. Kunzang, president of the influential Ladakh Buddhist Association (LBA) told The Wire. ‚ÄúOur identity, culture, geography, way of life and food is different from J&K. That is why we wanted that Ladakh be separated and administered by the Centre.‚Äù

At the Independence Day ceremony, 19-year-old Tenzin Minkey stood with her fists tightly clenched as she watched columns of police personnel and school kids march to the military marching beat. As the columns would pass the Indian flag and offer a salute, Minkey would raise her fist and offer her cry of allegiance, ‚ÄúBharat Mata ki Jai!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe have always been proud Indians. Today, we are free from the clutches of Kashmir that held us back for 70 years, and I am extremely happy. We had nothing to do with the conflict but our schools and colleges would also be shut when the situation would get tense in the Valley. We were made to learn Urdu, even when nobody here speaks Urdu,‚Äù she said.

Her father, Tenzin, was a little more circumspect. ‚ÄúThere is great enthusiasm right now, especially among the youth. However, the fact is that there is a lot of uncertainty. Protections on land and reservation of jobs are also gone now. That could create issues,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúToday, you are seeing an initial euphoria. But this will change in a few days.‚Äù

Concerns of the tribal population

Two days after breaking into a dance during the Independence Day celebrations, BJP‚Äôs member of parliament from Ladakh, Jamyang Tsering Namgyal, appeared a little more subdued and circumspect. ‚ÄúAfter the Centre announced its decision to make Ladakh a union territory, the biggest concern of the tribal population here is to protect their identity, culture, land and economy,‚Äù he said while speaking at the launch of a national tribal festival in Leh in the presence of the Union minister of tribal affairs, Arjun Munda.

He also handed a letter to Munda outlining the vulnerability of Ladakh‚Äôs 98% tribal population owing to its ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô land-based economy, limited means of livelihood, undeveloped markets, harsh climate, close proximity to China and Pakistan borders, presence of Indian army and paramilitary forces and a fragile ecology under threat of climate change.

Namgyal urged Munda to declare Ladakh a tribal area under Article 244 ‚Äì which deals with the administration of scheduled and tribal areas ‚Äì and bring the new union territory under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution, which currently grants a degree of autonomy to four states in the Northeast.

Demands for autonomy

The demand is echoed by many leaders in the Leh district, including Kunzang, the president of LBA. He argued that now that the protections on land use and reservation of jobs no longer exist, there are a lot of ‚Äòapprehensions‚Äô and ‚Äòuncertainties. ‚ÄúThere need to be protections either under Article 371 or under Schedule 6 so that land and jobs are protected,‚Äù Kunzang said, predicting that in the absence of these protections, the people of Ladakh will suffer.

Due to the district being sparsely populated, he likened the people of Ladakh to tigers. ‚ÄúOur population is only about three lakhs. If people from all over the country start buying land and settling here, then we will be marginalised. Our culture will be lost. We need to be protected the way tigers are protected.‚Äù

Concerns over the loss of Ladakh‚Äôs unique culture and identity are now growing. ‚ÄúOurs is a very different culture from the rest of India, and if people from outside start settling here, that culture will be threatened. It will die,‚Äù said Tsewang Rigzen, who owns a small grocery store near Leh‚Äôs main market.

Tsering Morup, who stood outside the store, said that for this reason, it is crucial that Ladakh be brought under Schedule 6 of the Indian constitution. ‚ÄúPeople in other Indian states are wealthier than people here. If they start buying land here, there will be nothing left for us.‚Äù

According to the constitutional expert and vice-chancellor of the National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Faizan Mustafa, bringing Ladakh under Schedule 6 will grant it the kind of autonomy that it already had, as part of J&K, under Article 370. ‚ÄúAutonomy under Schedule 6 almost resembles the autonomy under the diluted Article 370 ‚Äì diluted by presidential orders over the years,‚Äù Mustafa told The Wire.

Since 1954, by a series of presidential orders, the Indian state extended 260 of its 395 Articles, 94 of the 97 entries in the union list, 26 of the 47 items in the concurrent list and seven of the 12 schedules to the state of J&K, thereby diluting its autonomy under Article 370.

‚ÄúLook, the reality is that we never demanded that Article 370 be revoked. We are not fools. We need those protections. But the government had to do it this way because their focus is the Valley and they can‚Äôt be seen to be going easy on them,‚Äù said a local leader who declined to be named. ‚ÄúSoon you will see that demands for autonomy, protection over land and jobs and a legislature will increase in Ladakh and the Centre will have to grant them.‚Äù

Not getting legislature a ‚Äòletdown‚Äô

The demand for union territory status has included the demand for a legislature with it, and the grant of former without the latter has caused disappointment. ‚ÄúWhile we are very happy that UT status has been granted, but not getting a legislature is a letdown. All political parties, social and religious organisations have always demanded UT status with the legislature,‚Äù said senior Congress leader and former minister in the J&K government, Rigzin Jora.

Kunzang agreed with Jora. ‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs disappointing to not get a legislature. That was our demand. But I am hopeful that the hill council will be granted legislative powers,‚Äù Kunzang said.

Hill councils

Leh and Kargil, the two districts in the newly-carved union territory of Ladakh, have retained their autonomous hill development councils, which came into existence in 1995 and 2003 respectively. Both have 30 councillors of which 26 are elected and four are nominated by the government of J&K. It is not yet clear who will nominate the members under the new arrangement.

The councils have powers to collect local taxes, regulate land use, prioritise the implementation of schemes, formulate budgets and others, making them among the most autonomous councils in India. Now, local leaders are hoping the councils will be empowered to legislate, granting the UT of Ladakh a degree of control over its laws.

As things stand, the councils can regulate the sale and purchase of state-owned land, but not private land, and that is a cause for worry. ‚ÄúSee, the land is an emotive issue here. We have a deep connect with the land and our economy too is dependent on it. So, it‚Äôs a big concern. Even with the hill councils, an individual can sell their own piece of land,‚Äù said Jora.

He argued that Ladakh turning into ‚Äòanother Manali or Shimla‚Äô will not be desirable. ‚ÄúIn Manali and Shimla, properties are owned by people from Mumbai, Gujarat. Locals are waiters and bartenders,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want our boys and girls to become waiters and bartenders.‚Äù

Mehboob Ali, who owns three hotels in Leh, agrees with Jora. ‚ÄúAlthough, we are happy with the UT status, there are some worries also. If big hotel chains come here, then they will take over our land, our hotels. We will have to work under them. We want development, but on our own terms,‚Äù Ali said.

Fear of loss of jobs

The youth in Ladakh would prefer if the Centre provide a form of reservation of jobs. Tashi Namgyal, a second-year student of Bachelor of Arts at the government degree college in Leh, explained that reservations are needed because Leh lacks the kind of education facilities and infrastructure that exist in other parts of India.

‚ÄúIt will be difficult for us to compete with them. We have only one degree college and that also does not have any specialised courses. People from outside will come with specialisations,‚Äù Namgyal said.

Rigzin, who recently completed her BA, raised apprehensions over the loss of job opportunities, ‚ÄúThere are very few job opportunities as it is. If more people will settle in Ladakh, then that problem is going to increase further.‚Äù

Concerns over ecology

Namgyal also said that the fragile ecology of Ladakh has its limits, particularly with the impacts of climate change increasingly being felt, ‚ÄúAlready, we are seeing that we have less snow and more rain. On top of that, there is the issue of plastic and solid waste which will become more serious if more people start living here.‚Äù

According to Tsewang Dolma, who heads the Ladakh Ecological Development and Environmental Group, an NGO that promotes ecological and sustainable development in Ladakh, Leh is already overburdened as it plays host to around three lakh tourists every year ‚Äì twice the population of Leh district. ‚ÄúThere are no facilities for plastic waste treatment and barely anything for treatment of faecal waste,‚Äù she said.

To add to the growing woes, Dolma said, a water crisis looms in the cold desert every summer. ‚ÄúAlmost every household in Leh either has a homestay or a hotel. And with the number of tourists that we get, there is a huge water crisis.‚Äù

She suggests that new tourist spots be developed, a cap be fixed for the number of tourists and a tax be levied. ‚ÄúWe have to reduce the burden on Leh. The government can develop other tourist spots. It is also important to limit the number of tourists to say, 2,00,000, every year and charge an environment fee like Bhutan has done,‚Äù she said.

Otherwise, according to Dolma, the comparison, dreaded in these parts, will have to be made. ‚ÄúWe need safeguards, otherwise it will not take long for Leh to turn into another Manali or Shimla,‚Äù Dolma said.

Kunzang is hopeful that all the concerns will be taken care of before October 31, when the division of J&K takes effect. ‚ÄúWe have some time. We are forming committees which will look at each and every issue and negotiate with the government. Hopefully, we will be able to resolve the issues,‚Äù he said.

A divided UT

As the new union territory of Ladakh heads towards an uncertain future, it also stands divided. As previously reported by The Wire, Kargil ‚Äì the other district which will form the new union territory ‚Äì has seen widespread protests and shutdowns since August 5, when the drastic steps were announced.

While the people of Kargil and Leh have broadly similar worries over the protection of land and reservation of jobs, their views differ on the bifurcation of the state. While Leh has since 1949 demanded that it be separated from J&K and administered by the Centre, Kargil has never stood by that demand, citing its close ties with the Kashmir Valley and aversion to further division of the state.

In the week after the decision to bifurcate the state was announced, the two districts saw very different reactions. Leh rejoiced, with fervent gusto initially and with some caution as time wore on. Kargil, on the other hand, has protested with the kind of intensity that has rarely been seen.

This has prompted the LBA to write to home minister Amit Shah to seek the protection of Buddhists in Kargil, who form 15% of the population in the Muslim-majority district. The organisation has claimed that there has been an attempt to ‚Äúinfuse communal hatred among the people of Kargil against the Buddhist community and there was an immediate need to ensure the safety and security of Buddhists living in Kargil district.‚Äù

Leaders of the joint action committee in Kargil have said that these worries are unfounded. ‚ÄúThere is no truth to this. It is an attempt by the LBA to dilute our struggle. Buddhists in Kargil have always lived without any fear and will continue to do so,‚Äù said Asgar Ali Karbalai, a former Congress MLA from Kargil and now a key member of the JAC.

He also stressed that the agitation in Kargil will continue. ‚ÄúSo far the government has not responded positively. So our agitation will only pick up now. We are against the division of the state and want to continue to be with J&K with our protection over land and jobs restored,‚Äù Karbalai said.

38,Goldman Sachs Sees More Pain in Store for the Indian Economy,"New Delhi: Analysts at Goldman Sachs see more pain in store for the Indian economy over the next few months despite the government‚Äôs stimulus unveiled last week. In their recent co-authored report titled India‚Äôs Economic Slowdown, Andrew Tilton, their chief Asia-Pacific economist expects this slowdown to last at least a couple of quarters more.

‚ÄúWeak global macroeconomic conditions, and a negative fiscal impulse are assumed to be a drag on economic activity. The risks to our outlook for economic activity for FY20 continue to be tilted to the downside, given the continued weakness in consumption indicators, and persistent confidence concerns emanating from NBFCs that the Goldman Sachs India Financials equity analysts have pointed out,‚Äù wrote Tilton in a co-authored report with Prachi Mishra and Sakshi Goenka.

The economic slowdown, they said, started in January 2018 and that problems at Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services (IL&FS) was a result of the overall slowdown that had already been seeded in the third quarter of 2017-18 when the goods and services tax (GST) was introduced. The current slowdown has lasted for over 18 months and is the longest incident of sluggishness since 2006, the report said.

Deep impact

Automobile sales ‚Äì a commonly used benchmark to gauge the slowdown in the consumption patterns ‚Äì Goldman Sachs believes ‚Äì is just the tip of the iceberg, with other consumption indicators like air passenger traffic, tax collections, and sales of durable and non-durable consumer goods contributing twice the effect of autos.

‚ÄúAutomobiles contributed 17 per cent of the total slowdown, as against a 36 per cent contribution by other consumption-driven factors including bank agriculture credit, vehicle sales, rural wages, fuel consumption, farm exports, fertiliser sales, rail/air passenger traffic, household credit, and electronic exports,‚Äù they wrote.

While fertiliser sales and rail passenger traffic were the only indicators that started to fall towards the end of 2018, several variables, such as agriculture credit, rural wage growth and imports of electronic goods have, in fact, been on a descent since 2017, Goldman Sachs said.

‚ÄúSome part of the slowdown could possibly also be associated with the implementation bottlenecks related to the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) in 2017. Effective credit crunch was consequent to the glitches in the GST refund system which tightened the working capital cycle in the industry, especially for the MSME sector. Year-on-year growth in bank credit started to slow only in late 2018, driven by credit to services; and appears to be a symptom of the slowdown, rather than a cause,‚Äù they noted.

A slowdown in the investment activity, tighter funding conditions, a decline in consumer confidence, high real interest rates, central government expenditure and monsoon were some of the factors that contributed to the overall sluggishness.

‚ÄúThe role of global factors is also very significant; slower growth in India‚Äôs trading partners acted as a major drag on economic activity during this period,‚Äù they said.

While the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut repo rate by 110 basis points (bps) since February 2019, analysts at Goldman Sachs feel, the breadth and depth of policy easing have so far been much more limited than during previous occurrences of slower growth in India.

‚ÄúImportantly, policymakers have exercised restraint in easing fiscal policies. Despite being issued in a period marked by a slowing economy and an election year, the FY20 budget did not envisage any additional stimulus through the reported fiscal deficit figures,‚Äù they wrote.

39,"Bengal: Left Student Activists, Police Clash at Protest Against Unemployment","Howrah: Clashes broke out here on Friday between the police and the Left Front activists when they were marching towards the West Bengal secretariat demanding employment for the youth of the state.

LF leaders claimed that around 60 activists were injured in the clashes, five of them critically, while the police said people on both sides were wounded.

According to sources, police burst tear gas shells and used water cannons to disperse CPI(M) youth and student activists, who in turn hurled stones at them.

Members of Students Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) had taken out a rally on Thursday from Singur, the venue of the abandoned Tata small car plant, demanding jobs for the youth of the state.

The rally was scheduled to culminate at the state secretariat on Friday afternoon, but was stopped 5 km away near Mullick Ghat in Howrah.

Sources said the activists in their attempt to move forward broke one of the three barricades set up by the police at Mullick Ghat.

A scuffle broke out with the agitators hurling bricks at the police, who retaliated by bursting tear gas shells and baton charge, they said.

The injured have been admitted to a nearby government hospital for treatment, the police said.

‚ÄúWe were told by the police that five of our representatives would be allowed to enter the state secretariat to submit a memorandum. But as soon as our peaceful rally reached Mullick Ghat, police resorted to unprovoked lathi charge and bursting of tear gas shells,‚Äù DYFI state secretary Sayandeep Mitra said.

A number of SFI and DYFI workers fell unconscious during the clash, he said.

‚ÄúWe were to submit thousands of applications seeking jobs and answers on various other issues from chief minister Mamata Banerjee as part of the TMC government‚Äôs ‚ÄòDidi ke bolo‚Äò public outreach initiative,‚Äù Mitra told reporters.

Banerjee is referred to as ‚ÄòDidi‚Äô or elder sister by rank and file of the party.

The Mamata Banerjee government is sitting on the ‚Äúdebris of an industry‚Äù at Singur, he said.

‚ÄúShe has failed to bring about economic development in West Bengal. Several business summits were organised over the past few years but no investment has been made. Lakhs of youths are unemployed,‚Äù the Left youth leader added.

Later in the evening, the SFI and DYFI district units took out protest marches in various parts of the state.

The two Left bodies have decided to observe a two-day-long ‚ÄòBlack day‚Äô across the state in the weekend to protest against the police assault.

West Bengal Left Front Chairman and CPI(M) Politburo member Biman Bose condemned the ‚Äúbrutal attack‚Äù on the students and youth activists.

Also read: A Simmering Unemployment Crisis in India

‚ÄúThe way student and youth activists were attacked reflects the authoratarian attitude of the state government,‚Äù CPI(M) leader Mohammed Salim, who too is a member of the politburo, said.

Countering the allegations, West Bengal education minister Partha Chatterjee said the Left Front activists were trying to disturb the ‚Äúpeaceful atmosphere‚Äù in the state.

‚ÄúWhat was SFI and DYFI doing during the Left Front rule when industries were being shut down and flight of capital from Bengal took place? Were they sleeping? Our government has revived industry in the state,‚Äù Chatterjee, who is also the secretary general of TMC, said.

Singur had become the hotbed of West Bengal politics in 2008 after the Trinamool Congress of Mamata Banerjee led an agitation against the erstwhile Left Front government over acquisition of farm land the car factory.

The TMC agitation eventually led to the exit of the proposed small car factory and catapulted Banerjee to power in 2011."
40,"As India's Economy Suffers a Car Crash, Pain Spreads to Villages","Manesar: The narrow lanes in Aliyar and Kasan villages in Manesar, an automotive manufacturing hub on New Delhi‚Äôs southern outskirts, would usually be packed on Sundays with migrant workers employed at the nearby plants enjoying their day off, but not anymore.

These are hard times for an area dependent on the fortunes of companies like Maruti Suzuki, the car maker with the largest market share in India, and motorbike maker Honda Motor Co‚Äôs local unit. The auto and component makers in and around Manesar, have shed thousands of jobs.

Nationwide, according to industry estimates, automakers, component manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since the start of the year, in response to plunging car sales. Figures for August, like July, are expected to show a drop of more than 30%, making a 10th straight month of decline.

As the crisis in the sector bites harder small businesses in the towns and villages around Manesar, home to one of the three plants where Maruti Suzuki cars are made, have seen a fall-off in trade.

‚ÄúThere are already fewer workers in the village and those who still have jobs are either not getting paid for working overtime or are not spending as much out of fear they may lose work and need the money,‚Äù said grocer Rahul Jain, his shelves stacked with toothpaste and soaps from fast-moving consumer goods companies like Hindustan Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and Dabur India.

Even sales of products like cooking oil and flour have fallen. On the lower rungs of the service sector, barbers and tea stall owners said they had fewer customers.

Shoe seller Subhay Singh, in Manesar‚Äôs Aliyar village, has days when he doesn‚Äôt make a single sale.

‚ÄúMy monthly earnings have halved,‚Äù said Singh, who a year ago made an average Rs 8,000 a day. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs happening.‚Äù

In the United States there was an old adage: ‚ÄúWhen General Motors sneezes, the Wall Street catches a cold.‚Äù In India, the impact goes well beyond the stock market.

India‚Äôs automotive industry is the fourth largest in the world, employing more than 35 million people, directly and indirectly, and accounting for nearly half of India‚Äôs manufacturing output.

The industry has three main centres; Gurugram in the North, Chennai in the South, where among others Ford Motor and Hyundai Motor have plants, and Pune in the West, where Tata Motors and Fiat are located.

All of them are hurting, and the pain is radiating outwards.

Needing a Haircut

Before suffering the steepening slump in sales, the auto industry provided one of the few bright spots for manufacturing. Its troubles stem in part from banks‚Äô and non-banking finance houses‚Äô reluctance to extend consumer loans, as well as subdued demand, particularly in the countryside, where two-thirds of Indians live.

Laid-off workers returning to their villages are now putting more burden on a rural sector already suffering falling income from low crop prices and dampening consumer sentiment and growth across the country.

Gurmeet Singh had been earning Rs 10,000 a month until he lost his job at auto component maker Bellsonica in Manesar. Six months later, back in his hometown of Ambala in Haryana state, Singh is still looking for a job, and catastrophising about the future.

‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt had a hair cut in months, my shoes are torn and I‚Äôve been using the same pair of clothes since I lost my job. Only I know how I am surviving,‚Äù said the 26-year-old.

‚ÄúIf I don‚Äôt get a job, how will I build a house for my family, get married and pay off the loan my parents took to educate me?‚Äù he said.

His bleak outlook reflects an increasingly grim big picture. India‚Äôs economic growth slipped to a six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was re-elected to a second term in a landslide in May, is under pressure to provide a stimulus for an economy that is seriously undershooting the growth rate needed to generate enough jobs for the millions of young Indians entering the labour market every month.

Resisting a haircut

All this is cast against a backdrop of a weakening world economy, and uncertainties arising from the trade war between the United States and China.

Things are so manifestly bad that even one of the nation‚Äôs most popular biscuit makers, Parle Products Private Limited, is worried about the impact of the auto industry‚Äôs troubles on sales.

‚ÄúIf the economy is buoyant then even the rural consumer will not mind paying a little extra. But this (slowdown) has acted as a catalyst to the drop in demand,‚Äù said Mayank Shah, product category head at Parle.

Britannia Industries Ltd, which controls a third of the biscuits market in India, said it has ‚Äúnever seen this kind of a slowdown‚Äù where people are hesitant to buy a pack of biscuits costing just Rs 5 ($0.07).

‚ÄúIf the consumer is thinking twice before buying, then obviously, there is some serious issue in the economy,‚Äù Varun Berry, the company‚Äôs managing director told analysts in a post-earnings call last month.

Under pressure from businesses and investors to provide more stimulus, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman proposed a series of measures last month to help the economy and financial markets but some economists said it would not be enough to revive long-term demand.

On Aug 23, foreign investment rules were eased for several sectors, and sources say the government is expected to come up with more measures such as tax cuts for autos and real estate.

‚ÄúThe real revenue growth for auto and consumer goods sectors started declining nearly two years ago. The slowdown has merely gained prominence now,‚Äù said Arindam Som, an analyst at India Ratings, a Fitch group company, adding that he expects auto companies to further cut production.

A year ago, Vinod Chauhan had no vacancies at all in the 70 rooms he leased primarily to migrant workers in Manesar‚Äôs Kasan village. Today, over a third of those rooms are vacant and Chauhan fears things could get worse before they get better.

His son won‚Äôt be getting the new car that Chauhan planned to buy him this year, and the landlord has also shelved plans to build another 100 hostel apartments.

‚ÄúIf I am not able to rent out all the rooms I currently have, how will I manage with more?‚Äù said Chauhan.

41,State of the Economy Is Deeply Worrying: Manmohan Singh,"New Delhi: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said the state of the economy was ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù and urged the government to put aside ‚Äúvendetta politics‚Äù and reach out to sane voices and thinking minds to steer the economy out of this ‚Äúman-made crisis‚Äù.

The Congress leader said ‚Äúall-round mismanagement‚Äù by the Modi government was responsible for the slowdown.

‚ÄúThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 pc signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slow down,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Targeting the government, Singh said the country‚Äôs youth, farmers and farm workers, entrepreneurs and the marginalised sections deserve better.

India cannot afford to continue down this path, he said, adding, ‚ÄúI urge the government to put aside vendetta politics, and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds, to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.‚Äù

Singh said it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6%.

‚ÄúThis makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST,‚Äù he said.

The former prime minister alleged that institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded.

On the government taking Rs 1.76 lakh crore from the RBI reserves, Singh said the resilience of the RBI will be tested after this record transfer to the government.

This, he said, ‚Äúclaims that it does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall‚Äù.

Noting that domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18-month low and nominal GDP growth is at a 15-year low, he said, ‚ÄúThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiments are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recover‚Äù.

Blaming the Modi government‚Äôs policies for massive job-less growth, he said more than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone.

There will similarly be large-scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting most vulnerable workers, he said.

He said rural India is in terrible shape as farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined.

The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their incomes, by inflicting misery on over 50% of India‚Äôs population, he alleged.

Watch: How Will RBI‚Äôs 1.76 Lakh Crore Reserve Transfer Help The Economy?

The former prime minister, a noted economist, said the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

‚ÄúBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase its exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignments. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government,‚Äù he alleged.

The scathing attack by the former prime minister comes after the country reported a slow GDP growth rate of 5% for the first quarter of this fiscal.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product growth to over six-year low of 5% in the April-June quarter of 2019-20."
42,Can India's Rich Wealth Creators Boost the Economy to $5 Trillion?,"Addressing the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Independence Day, said that wealth creation is a national service and that wealth creators should not be viewed with suspicion.

Furthermore, he added, only when wealth is created can it be distributed.

Wealth creation is a great national service. Let us never see wealth creators with suspicion. Only when wealth is created, wealth will be distributed. Wealth creation is absolutely essential. Those who create wealth are India‚Äôs wealth and we respect them: PM @narendramodi ‚Äî PMO India (@PMOIndia) August 15, 2019



These statements come at a time when the economy is facing severe headwinds and yet, the prime minister has set a tough target of almost doubling the economy to $5 trillion in the next five years. Even if it is in nominal rupee terms, including a depreciation of the rupee by 15%, it would require an average 16% rate of growth over the next five years. Investments which have been significantly down compared to their peak in 2012-13 have refused to show an uptrend and without that, the target is unachievable.

Private investors are not boosting their investment significantly. The rich are unhappy about the additional cess levied on incomes above Rs 2 crore in the budget presented in July. Other changes pertaining to the corporate sector have also acted as a spoiler for businessmen. Important corporate leaders, who were earlier supporters of the current ruling dispensation, are ticked off enough to speak out about the deteriorating climate for investment. They have also complained of tax terrorism by the tax departments.

Modi‚Äôs words on Independence Day therefore were a balm to the frayed nerves of the business community.

Also read: In U-Turn, FM Nirmala Sitharaman Rolls Back FPI Tax Announced in Budget

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman followed it up this week after announcing some sops to the investors. This came on the back of Niti Aayog boss Rajiv Kumar saying that India hasn‚Äôt seen a liquidity crisis like this in the last 70 years. Prior to that, the RBI governor and members of the Economic Advisory Council to the prime minister had also stated that there is a slowdown. The concessions now announced by the finance minister are also an admission of a declining economy.

But is it not too little too late. Sitharaman maintained that Indian economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. So, the package announced caters to the corporate sectors and not to the root cause of the problem. It shows the clout of the corporate sector with the government and the belief that they are the wealth creators and need to be mollified.

But are businessmen the only wealth creators?

In India there are about 35 million demat accounts. Presumably they represent those who trade in the stock markets. That is less than 3% of the population. But most of the stocks are held by a tiny percent of the corporates, foreign portfolio investments (FP!s) and financial institutions.

A large number of people also save small sums of money and invest it. These are the households, the savers whose money is invested in financial assets and banks, and from the banks it goes to the investors. So, while encouraging businesses, one should not forget the workers, farmers, the officegoers, etc. ‚Äì we should celebrate everyone. But Modi did not mention them and Sitharaman has not catered to them.

Stagnant rate

The moot point is why is the investment rate stagnant? Output and employment have been stagnant or declining. Not only is enough new work is not being created for those entering the labour force, but workers have been losing employment as various surveys show. Consequently, as real income has declined for a large segment of the workers, demand has fallen short.

Furthermore, according to an OXFAM report, disparities have grown rapidly with nine people having as much wealth as the bottom 50% of the population. And, the top 1% of the population hold 51% of the national wealth. Clearly, the top wealth holders have been cornering a disproportionate share of the wealth and incomes of the economy. So, do they need more incentive or is it those at the bottom who need more support?

This kind of extreme inequality raises the question ‚Äì who should be taxed how much? According to the ‚Äòability to pay‚Äô principle of taxation, those with higher incomes and wealth ought to pay not only higher taxes but higher tax rates.

After the global crisis in 2007-08, Warren Buffet said that the rich need to pay more tax for capitalism to survive. This has been repeated again recently. Buffet‚Äôs statement was supported by the rich in the US, Germany, Italy and France. But the Indian rich do not seem to want to pay more taxes.

How much more tax the rich should pay is a political decision.

Fixing rates

An income of Rs 2 crore is 160 times the current per capita income. There are very few people in this category. According to tax data, 1.5 lakh individuals declare an income above Rs 1 crore. The number of people declaring an income above Rs 5 crore is 6,361. The number declaring an income above Rs 2 crore is around 40,000. The number of tax filers in India in 2018-19 was 61 million. So, those impacted by the higher tax rate would be only 0.1% of the tax payers and 0.004% of the population.

The new tax rates after the increase in surcharge are comparable to what people earning similar amounts pay in some of the advanced countries like, Germany. In reality the tax rates paid by the rich are much less than what appears to be on paper. They take advantage of innumerable concessions and deductions allowed to them and they resort to black income generation by declaring only a part of their incomes. Warren Buffet once said that he pays a lower tax rate than his secretary because of these tax concessions. In India, the situation is likely to be even worse given the resort to large black income generation by the rich.

The Indian rich unfortunately compare the tax rates on paper to those in some of the developing countries or in the South East Asian economies. Since capital has become highly mobile, they threaten to leave India. There are 90 tax havens and funds can be easily moved out through them through the process of ‚Äòlayering‚Äô, erasing the trail for the agencies to catch them.

Flight of capital

Further, since 2014, 23,000 of these rich people, called high net-worth individuals (HNWI), have left India. So, a large number of ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are voting with their feet?

Flight of capital is a risk minimisation strategy to relocate in tax havens which offer low tax rates and a high degree of secrecy. The US has been complaining that rich companies have been relocating their offices to jurisdictions with low tax rates, like, Google and Starbucks moving to Ireland. This is called BEPS (Base Erosion Profit Shifting). So, globally, many of the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô are more concerned about their profits and less about national well-being.

The Indian economy has suffered due to the shocks administered by the government in the form of demonetisation and GST. Add to this the non-bank financial institution and the non-performing assets problem of the financial sector. Though the official data does not reflect it, the economy has been tanking with capacity utilisation at around 75%. This is the real cause of the lack of pick up in private investment and cannot be countered by cut in tax rates or cuts in interest rates or by a boost to the stock markets as the ‚Äòwealth creators‚Äô have been demanding. The RBI has cut interest rates by 1% over the last one year and the stock market has been on a high but investment rate has not budged.

In the current quarter, the official nominal rate of growth is about 7% so how can it be raised to 16% if the private sector investment does not rise sharply. Foreign investment is small and uncertain given global and national uncertainties. Meanwhile, the government has proposed Rs 100 lakh crore investment in five years.

But this year, the capital expenditure in the budget is pegged at Rs 8.5 lakh crore (including the public sector) ‚Äì nowhere close to the average of Rs 20 lakh crore targeted. So, the prospects of reaching $5 trillion by 2024 are bleak even if the rich are incentivised and their hurt feelings are soothed from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

43,Jobs Crisis: Government Needs to Wake up and Smell the Masala Tea,"Parle Products‚Äô announcement that it may have to let go up to 10,000 employees has caused a stir as big as news of a recession in the auto sector. Demand has been falling and government policies have further exacerbated the crisis, says the company.

Surely people can afford a packet of biscuits, one might ask. And that is true. But the news indicates something deeper, that people‚Äôs purchasing power has reduced so much that they are holding back from spending on even low price products. It shows that India is in, or at least is heading towards, a recession and no one seems to have a clue on how to handle it.

A biscuit cannot be compared with a car ‚Äì the latter is a one-time buy that doesn‚Äôt get changed very often, while consumers buy biscuits regularly, often several times a week. That people are reluctant to commit a few lakhs is understandable, but when they demur from spending as little as Rs 5, it is indicative of a deep economic crisis.

The allure of Parle G

A senior executive from the company had once told me that there was no part of India, however remote, where Parle G biscuits were not available. He had been to distant villages in the Himalayas, tiny hamlets in the hinterland and on generally inaccessible trekking routes, and found at least one shop with the biscuit on its shelves. He put it down not just to an efficient distribution network but also to the fact that there was a demand for Parle G, which meant that the shopkeepers themselves sought it out.

The biscuit, said the executive, fulfilled many kinds of requirements. It could be had at the start of the day with a cup of piping hot tea, it was a snack to be packed in children‚Äôs lunchboxes, a quick bite whenever someone was hungry and lunch was some time away, and a nutritious sugar boost to a labourer.

Also Read: The Life of Labour: RSS-Affiliated Union Slams NITI Aayog; Job Cuts on the Horizon

Most of all, it was cheap. It was a company mantra, he said, that a packet of Parle G biscuits would cost the same year after year. Of course, prices changed, but the company ensured that the entry-level price points would hold steady. This was done by changing packet sizes or through other ways, but the price remained the same. Taxes, if any, were incorporated into the final price. For the buyer, especially those who could not afford to spend more, it appeared that while prices of all essential goods ‚Äì everything really ‚Äì went up all the time, this was a constant. It added to the appeal of the product.

There are other brand attributes too ‚Äì quality is one, trust is another, and now, increasingly, nostalgia. Indian students living overseas frequently ask visiting friends and relatives to bring Parle G packets. Faced with changes in market trends, the company had banked heavily on nostalgia to remind customers of their product. Millennials have several more snack choices and for a demographic which seeks out ‚Äòartisanal cookies‚Äô, Parle G may appear old fashioned, a relic from an earlier time.

But those are normal challenges of the market place, as is competition. The company has, over the years, still maintained its leadership position and only expanded. But where changing tastes could not affect it, the government‚Äôs policies have. The imposition of GST drove prices up, and along with growing unemployment, job losses, and a bleak outlook for the future means that even a packet of biscuits has begun looking like a discretionary spend.

Other concerning developments

People cannot do without lunch, but they can forego another cup of tea, and with it, a biscuit or two. For a daily wage worker or a contract labourer, every rupee counts ‚Äì the uncertainty that there may not be any job, and therefore wages tomorrow, means it becomes imperative to save every paisa. Even for the salaried person, there is no guarantee that the job will exist in a few months; the auto sectors travails get a lot of media attention, but companies, big, medium and small are laying off large numbers of people without media coverage.

The collapse of Jet Airways meant that thousands of well-qualified, hardworking professionals found themselves jobless overnight, with little or no chance of getting back wages. They have mortgages, rents and school fees to pay ‚Äì they would undoubtedly think ten times before taking a vacation. The same applies on a different scale to the construction worker, who with no building activity anywhere, will think ten times before buying that packet of biscuits.

Industry associations have asked the government to provide relief to help keep their businesses running. This is understandable, though a pure classical free market economist might argue that these are the vagaries of business and therefore industrialists shouldn‚Äôt ask for the government for help. Grow up and don‚Äôt run to Papa like kids, is what the government‚Äôs economic adviser has told businessmen. (They may find this suggestion gratuitous, but don‚Äôt expect any businessmen to respond or complain in public.)

But the fact is that the government needs to attend to the growing sense of despair at the condition of the economy. Big business will find ways to tide over the crisis, even if it means letting go of employees and downsizing. But the small man has no safety net. He has no savings to fall back on, nor any government dole to rely on.

The NREGA scheme

At one time, schemes like the NREGA brought income to the unemployed all over the country ‚Äì they got jobs, wages and a sense of dignity. During the much-maligned UPA government‚Äôs administration, industrial and contract wages shot up because labourers preferred to go to their villages and get employment under NREGA. That has been curtailed and even if the government would like to, it cannot revive it in any significant way because it has no money to pay.

One of the big issues about GST is that back payments have been stuck in the pipeline for months ‚Äì that is a double whammy, since it not only sucks money out of businesses, it makes the products expensive and unaffordable.

The lack of investment by businesses, banks holding back loans, the collapse of NBFCs and the chaos created by demonetisation and the poor design and implementation of the GST has meant that no new jobs are being created. Old jobs have been lost, there is no growth and people have no money to spend. It is a vicious circle and a government preoccupied with its political and ideological agenda has little or no time to revive the economy.

The buzz words are there and the budget was all about ‚Äònudging‚Äô behaviour and competing with China to become a $5 trillion economy by the time the next elections roll around. To the industrialists who are holding back from expanding because they are not sure of demand, there is no clarity on how the government will facilitate investment to become a global player; to the salaried person who worries she may not be able to pay her EMIs, grand statements about the future mean little. And for the daily wage worker, all that matters is regular work so that he can buy a packet of biscuits for his family.

Economists talk about the ‚Äòunderwear index‚Äô which can detect the beginnings of economic recovery during a slump. There should now be a ‚Äòbiscuit index‚Äô that indicates that the economy is now in acute economic distress. The pleas of industrialists may not move the government, but the news of a fall in the sale of biscuits should make it wake up and smell the masala chai."

Slowdown in various sectors to cost lakhs of jobs

As reported earlier in this column, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades costing lakhs of jobs and set to affect many more. Another labour-intensive sector, textile, is staring at a slowdown that could cost and has requested to the government to intervene to avoid job losses and prevent NPAs in the spinning sector. The Northern India Textile Mills Association (NITMA) has placed full-page advertisements in newspapers to urge the government to act on their demands.

An estimated 40,000 people employed by the diamond cutting and polishing units in Gujarat, Rajasthan and Maharashtra have lost their jobs in the past few months, The Tribune reported.

Parle Products, country‚Äôs largest biscuit maker has warned that it may have to let go of 8,000 to 10,000 employees owing to slowdown in consumption. Another biscuit giant, Britannia, has voiced similar concerns saying consumers are thinking twice before buying even Rs 5 products. Britannia managing director Varun Berry says this indicates ‚Äúa serious issue in the economy‚Äù.

Strike at 41 ordnance factories halts defence production

After the government announced its decision to corporatise ordnance factories, around 80,000-1 lakh employees across 41 factories started a month-long strike on Tuesday. Ordnance factories supply arms, ammunitions and other equipment exclusively to Indian armed forces. The decision to corporatise was taken after ‚Äúthe Comptroller Auditor General (CAG), the government‚Äôs auditor, and the armed forces, repeatedly raised issue of quality and delays in delivery of equipment by the ordnance factories,‚Äù Hindustan Times reported.

However, employee unions in the factories have vehemently opposed this move. All trade unions, including the RSS‚Äôs Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, have offered support and solidarity to the striking employees. Unions have claimed that the strike was total on the first day and there was no production. Employees call this move arbitrary saying, ‚Äúordnance factories, being war-reserve and solely dependent on the armed forces, cannot function as a commercially viable PSU‚Äù.

The Ordnance Factory Board (OFB), which oversees the factories, is perhaps the oldest government-run entity in India, predating even the Railways.

RSS-affiliated trade union criticises ‚Äòwrong‚Äô labour policies, slams NITI Aayog

At its 144th national committee meeting in Delhi last weekend, RSS-affiliated BMS criticised the government‚Äôs ‚Äúwrong‚Äù economic and labour policies. While accepting that the government was trying ‚Äúits level best‚Äù to boost economy, employment and skill development, the BMS said all these efforts were negated by ‚Äúwrong direction‚Äù of policy making bodies. ‚ÄúTheir main role ends up in converting India‚Äôs economy into a capitalist economy and all other developmental activities become ancillary,‚Äù their statement said.

They called for an India-centric development plan ‚Äúrather than that dictated by western rating agencies and institutions like WTO, WB and IMF‚Äù. They asked for restructuring of the NITI Aayog so as to ‚Äúremove its apathy‚Äù towards social organisations and trade unions. Hitting out at the policy think tank of the government, it added that ‚ÄúHarvard university experts who have no knowledge about Indian realities are the last word for them‚Äù.

While the BMS earlier welcomed the Wage Code Bill, the statement says that the ‚Äúso called labour law reforms‚Äù have contributed in damaging our economy. ‚ÄúThe Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) welcomes this codification and simplification of labour laws. But we opposed many of the anti-worker provisions in the labour codes,‚Äù it said, adding that six units in a family should be considered while deciding minimum wages. This, they say, is to be in sync with social realities of today that includes ageing parents.

They also flagged the crisis in the auto sector and said disinvestment from public sector has caused ‚Äúpanic‚Äù in the minds of the employees. The statement added that rise in contractualisation was a sign of ‚Äúfalling and distressed‚Äù private sector, adding that privatisation can‚Äôt be a remedy for the economy.

Threefold rise in number of manual scavengers despite ban

An RTI filed by The Wire has revealed that the number of manual scavengers in India has gone up from 14,505 in 2013 to 41,420 in 2018. This after a 2013 law had banned the practice of manual scavenging altogether.

The National Safai Karamcharis Finance and Development Corporation (NSKFDC), which works under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, had conducted a survey in 170 districts of 18 states. In those districts, a total of 86,528 people described their work as ‚Äúmanual cleaning of waste‚Äù. Oddly, the government identified only about half of them (41,420) as manual scavengers even when all had registered their occupation as the same.

Bihar, Haryana, Telangana and J&K have claimed they have no manual scavengers employed in their states.

Workers seize the shipyard that built the Titanic, plan to make renewable energy there

‚ÄúLate last month, 130 ship builders, steel workers, welders, and riveters seized control of the storied Belfast shipyard that built the Titanic in 1909,‚Äù Vice reported on August 14. The workers are demanding that the docks be nationalised and be used to produce renewable energy. The docks were being shut down as the Norwegian parent company failed to find a buyer but the workers have refused to leave the site.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs massive potential in wind turbines and tidal energy. They‚Äôre saying they could create thousands of jobs, and that we need a just transition to renewable energy,‚Äù a spokesperson for Unite, which represents the workers, told Vice.

This is an unconventional and welcome change for climate activists as workers show eagerness to transition to renewable energy.

45,"Economic Slowdown 'Very Worrisome', New Set of Reforms Needed: Raghuram Rajan","New Delhi: Former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan has called slowdown in the economy ‚Äúvery worrisome‚Äù and said the government needs to fix the immediate problems in power and non-bank financial sectors and come out with a new set of reforms to energise the private sector to invest.

Rajan, who was governor of the Reserve Bank of India from 2013 to 2016 but was denied a second term, also called for a fresh look at the way GDP in India is calculated, as he referred to research by Narendra Modi government‚Äôs former chief economist Arvind Subramanian about overestimation of growth rate.

‚ÄúThere are a variety of growth projections from the private sector analysts, many of which are perhaps significantly below government projections and I think certainly the slowdown in the economy is something that is very worrisome,‚Äù Rajan told CNBC TV18.

Also read: RBI Likely to Cut Policy Rate by 25 Bps Amid Concerns of Economic Slowdown

India‚Äôs economic growth has slowed to 6.8% in 2018-19 ‚Äì the slowest pace since 2014-15, and various projections by private experts and the Central bank estimate that the GDP growth in the current year will be less than the government‚Äôs estimate of 7%.

In ominous signs that the slowdown may be deep, the auto sector is facing its worst crisis in two decades with reports suggesting thousands of job losses in the automobile and ancillary industry, real estate sector has huge unsold inventory, while fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) companies have reported a decline in volume growth.

‚ÄúYou can hear businesses all around worrying and complaining out loud that they need some kind of stimulus,‚Äù he said.

Rajan said ‚Äúa fresh set of reforms‚Äù are now needed to boost the economy and growth rate.

‚ÄúWe need a fresh set of reforms informed by view on what we want India to be and I would love for that view to be articulated at the very top (that) here is the kind of economy that we want. One-off programs here and there don‚Äôt amount to a comprehensive reform agenda for the economy,‚Äù he said, adding borrowing in international markets is not really a reform but a ‚Äútactical action‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhat we really need is an understanding of how we are going to propel this country by the two or three percentage points greater growth that it needs and that needs fixing the immediate problems such as in the power sector, such as in the non-bank financial sector and those need to be done yesterday, not in the next six months, it is very important that those be tackled immediately,‚Äù he said.

Rajan advocated for a new set of reforms to get the private sector to invest.

‚ÄúWe need a new set of reforms, which energise the private sector to invest. Sops, stimulus of one kind or the other are not going to be that useful in the longer-term especially given the very tight fiscal situation that we have. Instead bold reforms, well thought of, not jumping off the cliff, but really seriously thought out reforms in a variety of areas which energise the Indian people, energise the Indian markets and energise Indian business.

‚ÄúThis is what we need today and I really hope we put our best minds to think about this because absent that my sense is that we are in for not so good times,‚Äù he said.

The former governor also drew attention to former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian‚Äôs research that GDP growth was overestimated by 2.5% during 2011-12 and 2016-17.

‚ÄúI also think that we should pay attention to some of the arguments made by the former chief economist Arvind Subramanian that in fact we may be overestimating growth with some of the new GDP data and I would suggest ‚Äì I have been saying this for some time ‚Äì we need fresh look from an independent group of experts at the way we compute GDP and make sure that we are not in a sense having GDP numbers that mislead and cause the wrong kinds of policy actions,‚Äù he said.

On the ongoing global economic slowdown, Rajan said that in comparison to the 2008 financial crisis, the banks are better levered across the globe.

‚ÄúHistory never repeats. So, I think there is more leverage than there was in 2008 but it is not in the same places. Banks are less levered than they were then. On the other hand, some corporate sectors, certainly in the United States are more levered, certainly in China are more levered and of course governments are more levered,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúSo, leverage was the big factor in 2008, it is different today. Not necessarily better, but different.‚Äù

Rajan said that he can‚Äôt predict another big financial crash but if it comes, it will be from different sources.

‚ÄúThe big issue today is not so much the financial sector frenzy, there is some but real (issue) is trade and global investments and the worries are that if we don‚Äôt pay enough attention, the old global order is going out of the window and there is nothing really to replace it to keep countries from doing things that serve their own interest rather than the global interest. So, it is a different world,‚Äù he said.

Asked about 2008 meltdown repeating, he said: ‚ÄúDo I predict a big crash coming? I don‚Äôt know but I do think that it is going to come from different sources and simply fixing the old problems is not going to prevent the new ones‚Äù."
46,"Mahindra Warns of Job Losses in Auto Sector, Seeks Government Help","Mumbai/Bengaluru: Indian automaker Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (M&M) said on Wednesday it saw a ‚Äúhuge danger‚Äù of job losses in the ailing domestic auto sector, as it sought government intervention, including tax reductions to revive demand.

A lending crisis among the country‚Äôs shadow banks, which fund nearly 55-60% of commercial vehicles and 30% of passenger cars, has led to automakers, including M&M and its rivals Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Tata Motors Ltd, to either cut production or temporarily close plants.

M&M said in a statement it was only able to maintain margins due to falling commodity prices and the government must reduce the Goods and Services tax (GST) rate to spur demand.

A slump in sales is also triggering massive job cuts in the sector that employs 35 million people directly and indirectly. Reuters reported on Tuesday that initial estimates suggest automakers, parts manufacturers and dealers have laid off about 350,000 workers since April.

47,Two Lakh Jobs Cut in Last 3 Months Across Automobile Dealerships: FADA,"New Delhi: Around two lakh jobs have been cut across automobile dealerships in India in the last three months as vehicle retailers take the last resort of cutting manpower to tide over the impact of the unprecedented sales slump, according to industry body FADA.

With no immediate signs of recovery, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA) feared that the job cuts may continue with more showrooms being shut in the near future and sought immediate government intervention such as reduction of GST to provide relief to the auto industry.

‚ÄúThe majority of job cuts have happened in the last three months. It started around May and continued through June and July,‚Äù FADA president Ashish Harsharaj Kale told PTI.

He further said, ‚ÄúRight now most of the cuts which have happened are in front-end sales jobs but if this (slowdown) continues, then even the technical jobs will be affected because if we are selling less then we will also service less, so it is a cycle.‚Äù

When asked how many jobs have been cut across the dealerships in India, he said, ‚ÄúClose to about two lakh.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is a guesstimate that our members have already cut 7-8% of the jobs in most of the dealerships as the degrowth has been very high,‚Äù he added.

Around 2.5 million people were employed directly through around 26,000 automobile showrooms operated by 15,000 dealers. Another 2.5 million are indirectly employed in the dealership ecosystem, he added.

The two lakh jobs cuts in the last three months are over and above the 32,000 people who lost employment when 286 showrooms were closed across 271 cities in the 18-month period ended April this year, he added.

Stating that more dealerships have closed in the past three months, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are collating the figures again. In a few cases some (dealers) have gone for closure of outlets, not the main outlets but those which were put up anticipating some geographic reach.‚Äù

Elaborating on reasons for taking the drastic step of cutting jobs, he said the ‚Äòmargin of error‚Äô in the business in the past few years has really gone down with cost almost doubling in the last three to four years.

‚ÄúThe margin that we earn overall as a business has not gone up. Therefore, if we go into a degrowth situation we get into cash loss. So to avoid that, dealers have been cutting down on costs other than manpower. Till March this year none of the dealers went for any manpower correction because we thought this was a temporary slowdown and it will soon recover,‚Äù he said.

However, he said, ‚ÄúThe way the first quarter has panned out despite good election results and the Budget, the degrowth continued. It is clear now that a proper slowdown has hit us. Now dealers have resorted to cutting manpower.‚Äù

Terming manpower as ‚Äòthe most precious resource of dealers‚Äô, Kale said, ‚ÄúThat is the last thing we try to cut down. When the slowdown started we first decided that we should go for stock reduction. Most of OEMs have supported us. While cutting other variable expenses that we can, we did not touch manpower till March and almost mid-April.‚Äù

Ruing the loss of jobs, he said, ‚ÄúIt is the last resort because it is difficult to get those manpower. We invest a lot on training them because it is a peculiar industry, whether it is a technical or a field job.‚Äù

As per Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM) figures, vehicle wholesale across all categories declined by 12.35% to 60,85,406 units in April-June against 69,42,742 units in same period of last year.

On the other hand, as per data based on registrations collated by FADA, automobile retail sales in the April-June period declined by 6% to 51,16,718 units in the first quarter of this fiscal as against 54,42,317 units in the year-ago period.

Passenger vehicles (PV) segment has been the worst hit with sales continuing to decline for almost a year now. In July, market leader Maruti Suzuki reported a 36.3% drop in its domestic PV wholesales, while Hyundai saw a dip of 10%.

M&M sales were down 16%, Tata Motors‚Äô PV sales fell 31% while that of Honda Cars India Ltd (HCIL) also came down 48.67% during the month.

Seeking immediate government intervention, Kale said, ‚ÄúWe are hoping, from whatever we are hear that the government has taken note of the serious situation that is going on in the overall economy, specifically with the auto sector. We are hoping for some support for the auto sector in the next few days or week or two.‚Äù He said the auto industry has already put out a request for GST cut.

‚ÄúIt is not a permanent demand. We know GST is such a huge developmental agenda for the government, but at the same time (it is needed for) reviving the auto industry. We (auto industry) are almost 8% of the GDP and 49% of manufacturing GDP,‚Äù Kale said.

He said while the revival of monsoon holds out hope, resolution of liquidity crisis, specially with the NBFCs, will go along way in helping the auto industry recover from one of the worst sales slumps in its history."
48,Why Aggregate Employment in India Is Shrinking,"Question of livelihood and the lived reality of people, sooner or later, catch up with any democratically-elected government.

One of the major promises on which the 2014 elections were won was massive job creation. Even after its stunning victory in 2019, primarily fought on the national security plank, among the first things the new Narendra Modi government did was to set up a cabinet committee to create jobs.

Clearly, the sensitivity of the livelihood issue is recognised and likely to be taken up by the opposition in coming days, with the potential of quickly altering opinions.

In fact, there was wide speculation after the resignation of the chairman of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) that the employment data, showing the highest unemployment rate in 45 years, was willfully suppressed.

Finally, the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) data was made public on May 31, 2019. What does it show?

Key takeaways

Preliminary analysis of PLFS data shows that the most striking news ‚Äì for the first time in 45 years, ever since NSS have been conducted ‚Äì is the contraction of aggregate employment by 1.2 million between 2011-12 and 2017-18 (Table 1).

Aggregate employment, which stood at 472.5 million in 2011-12, came down to 471.3 million in 2017-18. This is primarily driven by rural women losing 24.7 million jobs ‚Äî other segments of the workforce however saw net addition to jobs.

Table 1: Aggregate change in employment (million) Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker Total worker 2017-18 239.0 77.0 123.8 31.5 471.3 2011-12 234.4 101.6 109.1 27.4 472.5 Net change 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

The decline in the rural female workforce is not new ‚Äì this has been happening for quite some time now. In the earlier period, between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the female workforce in rural areas shrank ‚Äì although the magnitude of the decline was less than in the current period ‚Äì by 21.8 million (Table 2).

The other big takeaway from PLFS data is the close to a fourfold slowdown in employment creation for rural males. Thus, the jobs crisis prominently visible in the previous period in rural female segment seems to have spread to the rural male segment now ‚Äì as employment in the latter segment merely increased by 4.6 million in the current period, compared to 16.8 million in the previous one ‚Äì engulfing the whole rural economy.

Hence, much more is needed than simple cash transfer schemes, increasing MSPs periodically or debt reliefs. Public investment in agriculture along with energising MGNREGS (to help create rural infrastructure), among others, should be on the cards.

Moreover, the pace of employment expansion for urban males also decelerated in the recent period (14.7 million) compared to the previous one (17.6 million). It is only in the urban female segment that employment growth picked up, registering 4.1 million increase compared to 2.1 million in the previous period.

Sectoral distribution

There is another way of looking at the employment debacle. It is to look at the sectoral distribution of employment. With the majority of rural persons still engaged in agriculture, a crisis in the rural economy most prominently manifests itself in agricultural employment. People in large numbers (27.1 million) deserted agriculture between 2011-12 and 2017-18, once again led by rural female workers (19.8 million) (Table 3).

This decline in agricultural employment is visible across every segment of the workforce, except urban males. Therefore, the much-discussed unremunerative returns from agriculture are confirmed by the latest data. People are seen to be leaving agriculture, primarily due to push factors, for there was inadequate absorption in non-agricultural sectors of the economy (25.9 million). Precisely, due to this reason ‚Äì more people abandoning agriculture than the available non-agricultural jobs ‚Äì aggregate employment has shrunk.

Also read: What Does the Periodic Labour Force Survey Tell Us?

Table 3 also shows the struggles faced by the ‚ÄòMake in India‚Äô programme and the futility of enormous money spent on imparting skills, as these were primarily targeted at boosting manufacturing employment. Overall, manufacturing employment growth turned negative (0.9 million) and benefits of ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô programme seem to have bypassed every section of the workforce, except urban males.

Thus, a comprehensive well-calibrated manufacturing policy focusing on the labour-intensive sectors seems to be the need of the hour. The construction sector, which is widely viewed as the employer of last resort in the previous period, barely managed to absorb 4.6 million new workers in the current period. How does this compare with the previous period?

Table 3: Employment change in major sectors: 2017-18 over 2011-12 (million) Major sectors Rural male worker Rural female worker Urban male worker Urban female worker All workers Agriculture -7.8 -19.8 0.6 -0.1 -27.1 Manufacturing -0.6 -3.7 3.3 0.1 -0.9 Construction 4.2 -2.6 2.8 0.2 4.6 Non-agricultural 12.4 -4.9 14.2 4.3 25.9 Total 4.6 -24.7 14.7 4.1 -1.2

Source: PFLS 2017-18

Table 4 compares the capacity of labour absorption in key sectors of the economy over two periods. Between 2004-05 and 2011-12, the construction sector added 24 million jobs, becoming the largest sector of the economy in terms of job creation.

Thus, compared to the previous period, there is more than fivefold deceleration in job growth in the construction sector. The manufacturing sector absorbed 5.3 million workers in the earlier period, which posted negative growth in the present period mentioned above.

Table 4: Comparing sectoral employment change with the earlier period (million) Time period Agriculture Manufacturing Construction Non-agricultural Total 2017-18 over 2011-12 -27.1 -0.9 4.6 25.9 -1.2 2011-12 over 2004-05 -34.4 5.3 24 48.9 14.6

Slowdown in non-agricultural jobs

The alarming situation in the aggregate labour market can also be comprehended from the slowdown in non-agricultural job growth. Notice from Table 4, a larger number of people moved out of agriculture (34.4 million) between 2004-05 and 2011-12, compared to the recent period (27.1 million) ‚Äì2011-12 and 2017-18.

However, aggregate employment still expanded by 14.6 million in the previous period, while in the present period, we already noted that employment shrunk by 1.2 million. This is simply because labour absorption in non-agriculture almost halved in the current period; while employment in non-agriculture expanded by 48.9 million in the previous period, presently it could only absorb 25.9 million fresh workers.

Thus, there is an urgent necessity to revive non-agricultural employment alongside supporting agriculture.

Finally, on the issue of comparability of PLFS with earlier NSS rounds. First, P.C. Mohanan, who resigned as NSC chairman, categorically mentioned: ‚ÄúWhen we [National Statistical Commission] approve a report, I am not going to give a figure which is not comparable with the other ones. Second, the concept of employment and unemployment are universally accepted. International Labour Organization prescribes the standards, we all follow it.‚Äù

Second, professor R. Ramakumar pointed out that the sampling design only changed at a later stage (second stage stratification) and there are inbuilt mechanisms to correct over/under-representation of any group.

Finally, by saying underemployment rates are not comparable with earlier rounds due to educational factors, it is implicitly argued that those looking for jobs but unable to find it are voluntarily unemployed. It is a cruel joke on those unable to find work, given the employment situation described above, when traditional sectors of the economy are shedding/inadequately absorbing labour and modern sectors are incapable of accommodating them (including the educated). Instead of denying the jobs crisis, it should be tackled head-on, for any government neglecting these facts does so at its own peril.

49,Chugging along - India‚Äôs economy is back on track. Can it pick up speed?,"IT IS easy to be awed by the Indian railway network. The 23m passengers it carries daily travel, in total, over ten times the distance to the sun and back. It is just as easy to find it unimpressive. Delays are frequent and trains antiquated. It takes 14 hours to get from India‚Äôs capital, Delhi, to its commercial hub, Mumbai. The equivalent trip in China‚Äîfrom Beijing to Shanghai, a similar distance‚Äîtakes just over four hours.

Similarly, India‚Äôs economy can be seen in two lights. Its long-term growth rate of 7% a year has proved far more dependable than the rail timetable. GDP has doubled twice in the past two decades. Yet deep poverty still lingers and jobs are scarce. And Indian growth has been left in the dust by the Chinese express (see chart).

After slow running for much of 2017, India is now near to full throttle. Growth of 7.2% in the three months to December put it ahead of China (which grew at a relatively leisurely 6.8%) and made it once again the world‚Äôs fastest-expanding big economy. Expectations for the rest of 2018 are similar.

Fans of Narendra Modi, India‚Äôs prime minister, credit structural reforms he has made over the past four years. The more plausible explanation is that Indian growth has returned to trend after a bout of political meddling. ‚ÄúDemonetisation‚Äù in late 2016, when most banknotes ceased to be legal tender overnight, squeezed growth to 5.7% in the first half of last year. New notes were printed, but last July, even as life was returning to normal, a new goods and services tax replaced hundreds of local and nationwide taxes, once again throwing the economy into confusion.

At least the tax overhaul, which knits India into a single market for the first time, will eventually increase growth. Boosters speak of annual GDP gains of 8-10% in the years ahead. That would not be far short of China in its boom years.

Renewed economic vim would be welcomed by the government in the run-up to elections due by early 2019. Even at 7% growth, too few jobs are created to absorb roughly 1m new entrants into the workforce every month. More than 20m people recently applied for 100,000 railway jobs, as train drivers, technicians and porters. A third of 15- to 29-year-olds are not in school, training or jobs. Mr Modi‚Äôs opponents have found that the theme of scarce employment opportunities has played well with voters. Faster expansion would help.

But predictions of Chinese-style growth seem over-optimistic in the absence of deeper economic reforms. Doing business in India has become easier in some ways, such as getting permits or bringing in foreign capital. But the labour market is as gummed up as ever. Private businesses find securing land for new factories near-impossible. Whole swathes of the economy, from coal and steel to banking and condom-making, remain at least partly under state control.

The hangover from a bout of over-exuberance dating from before the global financial crisis has left companies financially stretched and with enough production capacity to be able to delay capital expenditure. A few sectors are now contemplating investment‚Äîonly to find that banks may be unable to provide finance. Loans written off or considered likely to turn sour are near a fifth of the loan book at state-owned lenders, which have about 70% of market share. The resulting losses have left banks short of capital for fresh loans, though a planned bail-out and new bankruptcy code should, belatedly, help clear up the mess. Worse, a recently discovered fraud at a state lender, where rogue employees allegedly facilitated $2bn of loans to a diamond merchant who is now nowhere to be found, has highlighted their weak governance.

Early in Mr Modi‚Äôs premiership growth was helped by the tumbling price of oil, which India imports in vast quantities. But the price of crude, which fell from $110 to $30 a barrel during his first two years, has since rebounded to $65. Any higher and some familiar problems, namely current-account deficits, budget shortfalls and high inflation, will make an unwelcome return. Yields on Indian government bonds have risen from 6.4% last summer to around 7.5%, indicating some increase in investor concern.

Although India‚Äôs growth has depended less than, say, China‚Äôs on exports, it has benefited from a buoyant global economy and an open trade environment. The latter may be changing. Indian IT firms are facing restrictions on their employees working in America, challenging their business model. And India itself has taken a protectionist turn, recently imposing tariffs on a wide range of products, from mobile phones to perfume, in an ill-conceived bid to encourage domestic production.

‚ÄúIndia is a country that disappoints both optimists and pessimists,‚Äù notes Ruchir Sharma of Morgan Stanley, a bank. Naysayers who expected political meddling to hit the economy hard underestimated its resilience. Like commuters whose train has finally pulled in, optimists feel their time has come. All aboard?"
50,Economy - A downturn in India reveals the desperate need for deeper reform,"W ITHIN A FEW years, Indian planners hope that bullet trains will reduce the time taken for the 500km (310 miles) journey between Mumbai, the commercial capital, and Ahmedabad, the biggest city in Mr Modi‚Äôs home state of Gujarat, from six hours to just two. For now, laws that protect tiny properties are holding up the railway‚Äôs construction. Two years after breaking ground, the Japanese-financed project has not yet managed to acquire even half the land it needs. By contrast, China added another 4,000km of track for its nationwide high-speed network in 2018 alone.

Historians reckon that the two Asian giants have had roughly equal economies for much of their history. Only since the 1990s, when China began its daring, deep-seated economic reforms, has it raced ahead. Its nominal GDP is now five times India‚Äôs. The dragon has slowed its pace, but even so, notes a report by Rakesh Mohan, a Yale professor and former deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ), the country‚Äôs central bank, it is still adding the equivalent of a quarter of India‚Äôs economy every year. If India were to sustain its GDP growth per person of 7%‚Äîabout its average for the past two decades‚Äîto 2030, it would barely have got to where China is today. And even that may prove ambitious.

Now, with alarming speed, India has gone from being the world‚Äôs fastest-growing large economy to something more like a rumbling Indian railway train. In the quarter to June, growth slipped to 5%, the slowest in six years. Other indicators are more worrying still. Sales of trucks and buses fell 45% in the year to September, and even sales of cheap biscuits and soap have contracted. The 88% drop in overall credit flows to businesses in the two quarters to September compared with the same period last year suggests a virtual freeze on lending.

Believing its own boosterism, the government failed to see the signs. Yet even as the slowdown became more pronounced, Mr Modi still managed to get himself re-elected in May with a huge majority. The first budget of his second term, announced in July by the incoming finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, signalled business as usual. The emphasis was on new taxes, more handouts, more regulations, a further bail-out of public-sector banks and the airy goal of doubling India‚Äôs GDP to $5trn within five years. As the summer wore on, however, it became clearer that the economy had turned against Mr Modi, even if the electorate had not. The big question now is whether the downturn will be bad enough to force the prime minister into some of the much-needed reforms that he avoided in his first term. Some changes have started to be made in the past few months.

Initial tweaks in August had little effect, but on September 20th the government abruptly decreed a sharp cut in corporate tax, from an effective rate of 35% to a far more competitive 25%. The move prompted Mumbai‚Äôs biggest stockmarket leap in a decade. The market‚Äôs instant, oversized joy suggests two things. One is that there is a great deal of pent-up energy in the Indian economy, waiting to be released by wiser government policies. The other is that if Mr Modi‚Äôs government puts in some effort, it is capable of coming up with those wiser policies. Businesses are watching to see what will follow. There are rumours of a sweeping privatisation drive. But it is unclear whether Mr Modi‚Äôs reforming side can override his conservatism, which reflexively favours an interventionist state, protectionist trade policies and the opinions of Hindutva trade unions, small business lobbies and ideologues.

Some progress

These tensions played out during Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, which saw the introduction of some welcome reforms. A long-overdue bankruptcy law theoretically reduced the time to settle a business failure from around four years to nine months. The GST did, for all its paperwork, abolish absurd interstate duties and so sped up internal commerce. Fiscal discipline kept inflation modest. Infrastructure‚Äîand in particular power supplies‚Äîimproved substantially. Over the past decade 30m more Indians every year have been connected to the electric grid, which now reaches 90% of all homes. India climbed a stunning 65 places up the World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business Index and pulled in record hauls of foreign investment, totalling more than $35bn in each of the past three years.

Yet the government shied away repeatedly from risking its political capital on deeper structural reforms. Labour laws that make hiring and firing too expensive remained a block to growth, as did laws making it hard for companies to acquire land. Such blockages continue to hamstring efforts to expand India‚Äôs manufacturing base, Chinese-style, to create plentiful low-paid factory jobs for rural migrants. Instead of supporting small business, the government experimented with shock demonetisation, fancy new taxes and heavier enforcement. Rather than promoting trade, it scrapped existing bilateral deals, raised tariffs and sparred with the WTO . Disappointing his own business constituency, Mr Modi dodged calls to privatise some banks, industries and utilities, instead forcing healthy state-owned firms to swallow sick ones.

At the same time, regulators moved too slowly to deal with an urgent problem. Driven by starry forecasts and cronyism under the previous government, state-owned banks had let non-performing loans inflate to a $200bn balloon. Then, caught in the glare of increased scrutiny, they reined in lending, further crimping investment and pushing credit-seekers towards non-banking financial corporations ( NBFC s). In October 2018 a default by one of those caused hiccups across the financial sector. Despite $30bn in government bail-outs for state banks, and a slow decline in non-performing assets, lenders and borrowers remain wary.

Though foreign direct investment stayed strong in Mr Modi‚Äôs first term, all but a trickle of the new money poured into services and a few big acquisitions, rather than job- or export-generating industry. The largest single deal saw Walmart, an American retail giant, splash out $16bn for control of Flipkart, an online retailer. The ink had scarcely dried on Walmart‚Äôs cheque before the government radically changed the e-commerce rules that had underpinned Walmart‚Äôs decision to invest. Small traders, who are an important part of the influential Hindutva business lobby, had pressed the government for changes, revealing the kind of obstacles that reforms have to overcome.

All the while, talk of Indian growth obscured such facts as declining farmgate prices, stagnant urban wages, flat exports, rising household debt, a long-term decline in savings and investment rates, and flat or falling consumer spending.

Some of India‚Äôs top economists did notice the gloomy numbers and realised that since the country‚Äôs statistics agency changed its methodology in 2011, there had been growing divergences between calculations of GDP and a range of other indicators. The doubters, who include Arvind Subramanian, the government‚Äôs chief economic adviser from 2014 to 2018, do not suggest foul play but rather poor methodology, compounded by the difficulty of measuring an ‚Äúinformal‚Äù sector that makes up 45% of the economy and accounts for 75% of employment. If the critics are right, growth since 2011 may have been overstated by 2-2.5% a year. As Mr Subramanian notes, the trouble with bungling the numbers is that it is like driving with a faulty speedometer. Indeed, the strongest proof that growth was overstated may be that India appears to have driven off course. The current slump can largely be ascribed to policies followed in the mistaken belief that India was hurtling along at 7-8% annual growth, when the reality was more like 5-6%.

Since the slowdown has taken hold, Ms Sitharaman has scrapped the most onerous of new taxes and compliance rules. She also announced the government would support NBFC s, and top up a range of schemes meant to ease access to export credits and housing loans. Amid a series of rate cuts by the RBI , the government also imposed a slew of mergers between state-owned banks that will, in theory, improve their books and make them keener to lend. The sudden move to slash company taxes came with a further sweetener, a two-year window for new industrial investments to attract a rate of just 17%.

Businesses have broadly welcomed all these moves, as well as having their tax cut by a third, but concerns persist. Though the supply-side tinkering helps, it does not indicate personal attention from Mr Modi, let alone the kind of policy shift many feel is needed to kick-start growth. ‚ÄúThe lack of economic vision baffles me,‚Äù says a conservative think-tank scholar who now regrets voting for Mr Modi. ‚ÄúThey get this monster electoral verdict, and then do nothing?‚Äù

Turning ten stodgy state banks into four bigger ones, for instance, may indeed strengthen the financial sector in the long term. More immediately, though, it ties up the institutions just when the economy needs them. The government promises to buy itself more cars, and to lower interest rates on housing for public servants, but neglects stronger demand-side prods such as rural public works. Ms Sitharaman talks of tweaking export credits and speeding tax reimbursements for exporters, when letting the overvalued rupee drop would boost exports even more. She has chastised tax officers for being overly aggressive, but aside from the cut in corporate rates that simply brings India closer to world averages, has proposed no other bold tax relief.

This is badly needed. India has some of the world‚Äôs most convoluted taxes, and enforces them with gusto. GST paperwork is tricky. Rates for some goods are ruinously high. Cement and cars are taxed at 28% (plus hefty further taxes for cars), which is odd if you wish to save manufacturing jobs or spur housing investment. Some personal stories are hair-raising. One luxury-goods executive complains that inspectors invaded his home at gunpoint in the middle of the night and held him and his wife hostage for two days, threatening jail for not co-operating as they poked through his cupboards. They found nothing, but left the businessman shaken. He has decided to leave the country.

Can‚Äôt rely on unicorns

Despite the gouging, the government is faced with a chronic deficit. It pretends this is a mere 3.4%, but after allowing for hidden off-budget liabilities and state debts, overall government borrowing is closer to 9%. August brought a reprieve, with a hefty and controversial dividend payment from the central bank to shore up revenue. But those off-budget fudges, demands from states and shrinking tax receipts will soon start to squeeze the exchequer.

The gloom is not universal. The $180bn IT sector, centred on boomtowns like Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore) and Hyderabad, continues to prosper. NASSCOM , an industry body, counted 7,200 start-ups in 2018, of which eight became ‚Äúunicorns‚Äù, valued at over $1bn. Tata Consulting Services passed another milestone for Indian IT firms, reaching a market capital of $100bn. The sector cannot pull the rest of India along, however, and has its own limits. NASSCOM predicts that automation is likely to shrink the number of IT jobs‚Äîcurrently more than 4m‚Äîby some 14% in the next five years.

Population growth, rising productivity and growing aspirations can probably propel a big, diversified economy at a steady 5%. Barring a global crisis, even without ambitious new policies, India may be able to climb out of the current doldrums. Returning to the trajectory of 7-8% growth would take a little longer.

With luck, in a few years‚Äô time, the present slump may be regarded as a useful catalysing moment, like the economic crisis of 1991 that sparked India‚Äôs initial market reforms. But bringing back the brash, risk-taking ebullience of the mid-2000s will not be easy. Many believed Mr Modi when he promised achhe din‚Äîgood times‚Äîin 2014. Starting his second term with a deep slump, he has no one to blame but himself. Worse, say critics, he has no one to turn to. Ms Sitharaman is tough and straight, but her team does not inspire confidence. ‚ÄúWe always had bad institutions, but a few really talented people‚Äîninjas who could go in and make things work,‚Äù says a former finance-ministry mandarin. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs a Trumpian wasteland.‚Äù‚ñ†"
51,A big stink on the brink - The risks from India‚Äôs rotten banks,"I MAGINE A CENTRAL bank tweeting that, yes, there are rumours of ‚Äúcertain‚Äù banks facing deposit runs but ‚Äúthere is no need to panic‚Äù. Would you feel reassured? That is the unenviable position Indians found themselves in last week as a financial storm rumbled on in the world‚Äôs fifth-biggest economy with no sign of the authorities getting a firm grip. In the latest fiasco a co-operative bank, PMC , is accused of fraud, prompting depositors to yank their cash out. Meanwhile shares in Yes Bank, a private lender, have collapsed by 40% in the past month as rumours swirl. These are not isolated incidents. Roughly a third of the financial system is on crutches or under suspicion. Dazed by the scale of the task, the government and the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) are dithering. Until they act, India‚Äôs economy will not perk up‚Äîand there is a danger of a full-blown crisis.

The origins of this mess go back to 2005. In the first phase conventional banks, which control about four-fifths of the system‚Äôs assets and are mostly state-run, lent too freely to infrastructure and industrial projects, sometimes ones backed by well-connected tycoons. The plight today is a continuation of the second phase: a boom-and-bust in lightly regulated shadow banks, which control the remaining fifth of the system. The danger grew in 2016 when the government temporarily abolished large banknotes, leading many people to deposit money in banks and mutual funds. These, in turn, used the windfall to make loans to shadow banks, which went on their own lending binge, often using the money to finance property projects.

Today the financial system is stuffed with bad debts. Perhaps a tenth of loans are dud, maybe more. The shadow banks are vulnerable because they use short-term debt (rather than ordinary deposits, which they are mostly restricted from raising) to fund long-term loans of their own. There is also an undercurrent of fraud and bogus accounting. In 2018 Punjab National Bank said that a diamond dealer had stolen $2bn from it. Later that year IL&FS , a big shadow bank with government links, collapsed. Credit-rating agencies have been giving high ratings to flaky firms. With suspicion rife, a handful of shadow banks face a severe funding squeeze, and the entire financial sector is wary of lending. As a result credit is growing at near its slowest pace in 20 years. The ripple effect has stalled building projects, starved wholesalers of loans to buy inventory and prevented farmers from borrowing to buy tractors and motorbikes.

The response of Narendra Modi‚Äôs government and the RBI has so far been halting. The government has repeatedly but belatedly pumped inadequate sums of capital into the state banks, and promised to merge some of them. On September 20th it slashed corporate taxes to try to revive animal spirits. The RBI , meanwhile, has cut interest rates five times this year. Presumably they hope that this will be enough to boost the economy, while the big state banks slowly regain their strength and the remaining well-run private banks, such as HDFC and Kotak, lend more freely.

The crisis, however, cannot be compartmentalised. Shadow banks have borrowed from bad banks which may have borrowed from good ones. Another collapse in one corner could easily cause panic elsewhere. Because the banks are in poor shape, the RBI ‚Äôs interest-rate cuts are not being passed on to consumers and firms. Another lurch down in the economy threatens a new series of bad debts at the recuperating state banks. And there is a palpable sense that governance is broken. Bank boards, auditors, rating agencies and the RBI have all failed to stop the rot.

India needs a two-pronged clean up. In the short term the RBI should do another ‚Äústress test‚Äù of the banks, and test the shadow banks, too. The results should be made public. If state banks need capital they should get it. Some shadow banks will fail and should be wound up. The approach taken with IL&FS offers a template. It was put into a form of administration and creditors face a big haircut (although the process could be quicker). In the longer run, India should privatise its state banks so that they can escape control by politicians. Shadow lenders, meanwhile, should face the same prudential rules as banks. The RBI needs to overhaul its system of ongoing supervision. It used to be widely admired, but is starting to look like part of the problem.

This ought to be India‚Äôs moment. It has a big domestic economy and lots of entrepreneurs, oil prices are fairly low‚Äîhelpful for a big importer‚Äîand multinationals are keen to shift their factories out of China. Cleaning up the financial system is a gigantic task. But until it is done India will not thrive.‚ñ†"
52,Reviving India‚Äôs economy - Modi‚Äôs mission,"INDIA, a giant economic mediocrity, is cursed by having too many economists. Its outgoing prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has a doctorate from Oxford, ran the central bank in the 1980s and led the liberalisation programme that India put in place in 1991 after a currency crisis. Yet as prime minister Mr Singh had little grip or public support, serving at the pleasure of Sonia Gandhi, the populist leader of the Congress party. By the end of his ten-year term he admitted he had failed. In August, as the rupee tumbled, he addressed a gathering of India‚Äôs policymaking elite at his house in Delhi. The economy faced ‚Äúvery difficult circumstances‚Äù, he whispered.

Mr Singh‚Äôs successor could not be more different. Narendra Modi‚Äôs economic views have been formed while running the business-friendly state of Gujarat for the past 12 years. Asked some time ago about his economic influences, he described his homespun framework, jotting diagrams on a pad as he spoke. He has studied Singapore and China, but thinks that ‚ÄúIndia is a democracy and has different requirements‚Äù. Striking a balance between farming, small firms and global companies is required, with limited but muscular administration and populist appeal: ‚ÄúMen, machines and money must work together.‚Äù

Having run Gujarat well, Mr Modi now faces the far harder task of running India. He has big advantages‚Äîadministrative competence, control over his party and a majority in Parliament‚Äîthat should ease decision-making. Unlike Mr Singh, he has also campaigned and won on a platform of aspiration and economic reform. India needs ‚Äúless government and more governance‚Äù, he declared on the campaign trail.

The immediate situation is precarious, notwithstanding a post-election surge in the stockmarket. India suffers from stagflation. Growth is 4-5%, half the level at the peak, inflation is 9% and rising (see chart), industrial production is declining and the public finances are a mess. Although the current-account deficit has narrowed to below 2% of GDP, it is flattered by a de facto ban on gold imports and could yet blow out to scary levels again.

As The Economist went to press Mr Modi had not picked his finance minister. The front-runners are Arun Shourie, a journalist and ex-minister, and Arun Jaitley, an urbane stalwart of Mr Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party. Both are able. As well as dealing with the immediate mess, Mr Modi and his finance minister must grapple with India‚Äôs long-term trajectory. It is distinctly wobbly.

A decade ago the country seemed destined to rival China. Annual growth was heading towards 10%. India had the ingredients that had made East Asian countries richer: a growing population and rates of saving and investment of over 30% of GDP that would finance factories and roads, lifting the economy‚Äôs potential. Unlike most East Asian counties, India has never had a strong state, but instead, optimists argued, it had brilliant entrepreneurs who could wheel and deal the country to prosperity.

What went wrong? The raw inputs of growth‚Äîpeople and capital‚Äîhave been deployed badly. The rates of savings and investment have dipped and their mix has deteriorated. High inflation has led households to buy gold, shifting money away from the banking system where it can be productively employed. And a mixture of bureaucracy, excessive leverage, incompetence and corruption has led private companies (whose spending tends to have the most bang per rupee) to halve their investments as a share of GDP. What has been invested has often been tangled in red tape and graft.

India‚Äôs improvised miracle has hit its limits. Energy and chaos only go so far. Although poverty has fallen and there are pockets of dazzling wealth, much of the economy is primitive. Infrastructure is decades behind China‚Äôs. Industries that are close to the state involve corruption on a grand scale, with bribes paid to politicians and officials over the past half decade of anywhere between $4 billion and $12 billion. Only 3% of Indians pay income tax, leaving a hole in government finances.

About 90% of jobs are informal, leading to widespread poverty. Agriculture is feudal and food shortages cause inflation. India is meant to be industrialising but manufacturing contributes only 15% of GDP and 11% of jobs, and its share has been falling. A majority of India‚Äôs 50m manufacturing workers toil in facilities without electricity. A droopy rupee means India has been running to stand still. At market exchange rates India‚Äôs GDP remains smaller than Italy‚Äôs and ranks tenth in the world, about the same as in the 1980s.

There may be no one better qualified than the forceful Mr Modi to kick-start the investment cycle and slay stagflation. In his first month Mr Modi will beef up the prime minister‚Äôs office and knock heads together to get stalled projects moving. Some are embroiled in legal disputes which he will not be able to override; others are a matter for state governments. But still others are easy pickings. Roads, rail, coal and gas are areas where a decisive central government will make a difference, says Sanjeev Prasad, of Kotak, a bank.

Cometh the hour, cometh the man

In his first quarter in office he must tackle the bloated fiscal deficit, which has fuelled high inflation. Book-cooking by the outgoing government means that the true deficit is higher than official forecasts‚Äîat perhaps 7-8% of GDP (including the states). Mr Modi will trim spending on wasteful subsidies of fuel and food and defer the rolling out of welfare schemes passed by the last government in its dying days. A budget will offer a chance to reverse the previous government‚Äôs retroactive tax claim on Vodafone, India‚Äôs largest foreign investor. Doing so would soothe the nerves of foreign firms.

In his first year, Mr Modi must stabilise India‚Äôs rotten banks and tame inflation. Recapitalising state-run lenders will cost up to 5% of GDP and will involve taking on the bureaucracies that run them and the powerful industrialists who are sitting on bankrupt projects that need to be written off. It will be a test of Mr Modi‚Äôs resolve. Another test will be his stance on interest rates. The boss of the central bank, Raghuram Rajan, wants a tough new inflation-targeting regime. Mr Modi should back Mr Rajan, who is keen to stay in his job. After all, high inflation is partly why Congress lost.

A good first year will revive animal spirits. Ajay Piramal, a tycoon with a billion dollars in gross cash, is now looking to invest again. The election result is ‚Äúa good sign of the maturing of the electorate,‚Äù he says. Within two years the economy could be growing at close to its potential rate. Chetan Ahya of Morgan Stanley, a bank, forecasts growth of 6.8% by the quarter ending in March 2016. If Mr Modi achieves all this, he will have done the easy part.

In the long term he must raise India‚Äôs growth rate towards 10% and ensure that expansion starts to generate decent jobs. You do not become a superpower by creating an ever bigger army of underemployed drivers, idle security guards and ragged peons. India‚Äôs median age is 26, and every year for the next decade 10m people will enter the workforce. That requires a new vision for India and deeper reforms.

Critics argue that this is a step Mr Modi will be unable to make, and that he offers only a limited form of crony capitalism, with chummy deals struck with tycoons. This is unfair: many firms in Gujarat say that the bureaucracy works well, that the courts are fast and that graft is non-existent. The state has some impressive bureaucrats, ministers and institutions.

In any case India‚Äôs new economic plan will have to be home-grown, because simple prescriptions do not work. Outsiders often argue that all India needs to do is open up its economy and shrink its public sector. But the state is too puny in many ways: it is unable to enforce contracts and cannot afford to spend enough on infrastructure. The big impediment to foreign investment is not legal restrictions (most sectors are already open) but the same nightmarish business conditions that annoy local firms.

What might Mr Modi‚Äôs long-term plan look like? Some things are obvious. The solution to India‚Äôs fiscal problem (it has not run a budget surplus since independence in 1947) is to expand the tax net. A proposed direct-tax code, and a goods-and-services tax (GST), should achieve this. With more revenue, the state can build more infrastructure: the experiment over the past decade of getting the private sector to do the heavy lifting has had mixed results. The GST also helps make India a single market by replacing a myriad of local levies. The bureaucracy needs to be reformed; Bimal Jalan, a former central-bank governor, says the number of ministries should be cut.

But the big question is whether Mr Modi can make India a global hub for labour-intensive manufacturing. Japan, South Korea and China got richer by employing unskilled farmers in factories. The timing is perfect for India. Labour costs are rising in China; Japanese firms are shifting production from China because of military tensions; and the rupee has fallen, making Indian workers more competitive.

Sadly, it is hard to find an Asian boss who is interested. William Fung of Li & Fung, the world‚Äôs biggest sourcer of clothes for Western retailers, says activity is shifting to Bangladesh, South-East Asia and Africa. Zhang Ruimin, of Haier, a big manufacturer of household appliances, says he wants to automate his factories in China. Fujio Mitarai, the boss of Canon, plans to tilt production back to Japan and also automate it. When India is mentioned he raises his eyebrows.

About half of China‚Äôs exports are made by foreign firms. India could try relying on indigenous manufacturers instead. But they usually prefer to use machines, not employ people. They are also subscale. Mahindra & Mahindra, India‚Äôs local car champion, has a research-and-development budget that is 1% of Volkswagen‚Äôs.

Some argue that India could rely on a ‚Äútrickle-down‚Äù effect from its sophisticated IT, pharmaceutical and high-tech manufacturing industries. They employ only a few million people but generate exports worth 7% of GDP. As the owners and staff of these firms spend the value added they have earned, they might create jobs.

It may be possible on paper, but some are sceptical that trickle-down can deliver a widespread improvement in living standards quickly. Arvind Panagariya, an economist Mr Modi listens to, argues that such an approach will not transform India. ‚ÄúManufacturing is of the highest priority‚Ä¶In ten or 15 years‚Äô time India ought to be where China is today.‚Äù

Narendra the great mender

Can Mr Modi achieve this? In a technical sense he will have to transform the supply of the inputs of production. Most factories find it far too hard to get land, labour and energy. All three inputs are bound by a mesh of restrictive rules and bureaucracy, vested interests and corruption. One option would be to devolve power over these matters to the states, and hope that they compete among each other to raise standards, much as Gujarat has done. Another would be for Mr Modi to build momentum over several years for a wholesale recasting of the rules, driven by the centre. Either way, it will require nothing less than a complete change of outlook for a country that has forgotten how to do business simply.

Sitting at his desk in Gujarat, Mr Modi said that when he first took charge of the state‚Äôs economy, ‚ÄúI thought: the sky is the limit.‚Äù A similar ambition today would serve India well."
53,Bullock cart or locomotive? - A deceptive tweet casts doubt on the Indian government‚Äôs credibility,"N OTHING HURRIES governments more than an approaching election. But sometimes, as Piyush Goyal, India‚Äôs minister of railways, recently found, haste can cause accidents. Keen to tout the Vande Bharat Express, a fast new service, he posted a clip that showed the made-in-India train roaring through a station at a blinding pace. As eagle-eyed viewers swiftly noted, however, the film had been altered to run at double speed. Jokesters quickly counter-posted a cascade of mockingly accelerated footage, including a lightning-fast bullock cart zooming along a dirt track.

With a general election looming in April it is not just pictures, but dreary statistics that the government has been accused of doctoring. Indian opposition parties have often charged their rivals in power with massaging official data. But since the landslide victory of Narendra Modi‚Äôs Bharatiya Janata Party in 2014, critics claim, the practice has become commonplace.

In January two of the five members of the body that vets official statistics resigned in protest, after the government blocked release of what many consider the most accurate indicator of unemployment. The numbers were soon leaked, and to no one‚Äôs surprise they showed an embarrassing rise, to a 45-year high of 6.1%.

Other numbers have also sown suspicion. Soon after taking office Mr Modi‚Äôs government announced it would revise the official method of calculating GDP and rebase the data to a new year. Frequently since then, economists have puzzled over numbers that consistently show stronger growth than seems justified by other indicators. They also seem strangely impervious to obvious shocks, such as Mr Modi‚Äôs banning in 2016 of all currency bills worth more than 100 rupees ($1.41), or the imposition of a stiff sales tax with no fewer than seven separate rates and laborious forms for businesses to fill in.

In November, after an inexplicable three-year delay, the government‚Äôs number-wallahs released a new back series for GDP growth according to the new methodology. To some surprise, considering that the noughties are recalled as an era of unprecedented boom, the new statistics showed Mr Modi‚Äôs government smartly outperforming its predecessor.

Sceptics abound, as do theories of how and how far the government‚Äôs numbers stray from the truth. Some blame flawed adjustments for inflation. Arun Kumar, an economist, argues that the government‚Äôs estimates of the growth of the informal economy, which accounts for nine in ten jobs and perhaps 45% of GDP , presume too strong a correlation with the formal economy. Mr Kumar argues that it is quite possible for the easily measured, tax-paying part of the economy to be growing by 7%, even as the less perceptible poor are quietly suffering. Taking into account such drags as Mr Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúdemonetisation‚Äù, the shrinking of credit and a prolonged and continuing slump in farm prices, Mr Kumar suspects that the informal economy may in fact be contracting‚Äîsomething that would substantially reduce overall growth."
54,"Not in denial of state of economy, jobs: FM Nirmala Sitharaman","New Delhi: The government is not in denial over unemployment and the state of the economy, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Wednesday, adding there were clear indications that employment was rising and economy was looking up. She said there is a lack of comprehensive data for formal and informal sector employment, which was an impediment to a complete picture of the situation. ‚ÄúDid I say that everything is hunky dory? Did I say employment is not a critical criteria for, let's say, the common citizen?‚Äù she said at the TIMES NOW Summit on the theme - India Action Plan 2020.‚ÄúNot at all. And we are coming out with triggers to show where it is happening and where you need to do more. There's no denying at all,‚Äù Sitharaman said in response to a question on whether the heightened unemployment was not an issue for the government.The finance minister said six indicators, including higher employee provident fund registrations and new Mudra loan seekers, showed that employment was on the rise. ‚ÄúThere's no denying that comprehensive data for both formal sector employment and informal sector employment is absent. You do not have a comprehensive picture‚Ä¶ As a result, all of us definitely can seek comfort of our own data,‚Äù she said. She said the government had owned up to issues in collection of data and had decided against releasing such data, which it thought was faulty. ‚ÄúBut that does not mean that every data of the government is questionable that the government is hesitating to release every data related to, let‚Äôs say, employment or growth,‚Äù the finance minister said.Sitharaman also said the government was also not in denial about the state of the economy, and had been consistently working on troubling issues since August last year, introducing reforms for various sectors that could in turn spur consumption and consumer demand.‚ÄúIf the government is in denial mode, from July to February, there are people who tell me you present a budget every weekend, which means I have been acting on it,‚Äù she said. The minister pointed to the consistent recovery in GST collections, besides uptake in retail lending from banks and also rise in home bookings and increased purchases of ready to move in homes, as ‚Äúdefinite signs of positivity‚Äù in the economic sentiment.In response to a question on whether the government coffers were going empty, Sitharaman cited the 22% rise in capital expenditure, and GST collections crossing Rs 1 lakh crore each month since November 2019, as clear indicators that the economic and commercial activity was back on its feet.On the issue of banking sector officials wary of taking genuine decisions for the fear of prosecution and vigilance inquiries later on, the minister said it was the call of the banks to not seek a CBI or vigilance inquiry into a particular case. She added that in cases that were hanging fire for a long time, the banks have the option of reviewing the involvement of CBI. ‚ÄúThe exercise had already started and I hope because of these, that doubt which is there in their minds should really be removed,‚Äù she said.She added that an order from the Department of Financial Services in 2016 on holding the executive directors and chairmen of banks liable in case of something major going wrong, was also withdrawn."
55,Unemployment has increased because of rise in population: Yogi Adityanath,"LUCKNOW: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanth has blamed the increase in unemployment in the state on increase in population while crediting his government‚Äôs ‚ÄòOne District, One Product (ODOP)‚Äô scheme with creating more than 500,000 jobs for youths in the micro, small and medium enterprises sector.‚ÄúPopulation has increased, which is why unemployment has also increased,‚Äù Adityanath told a select group of media persons in Lucknow. UP registered a 60% increase in the number of unemployed people since June 2018 to 3.4 million. According to the 2011 census, the population of the state was around 200 million.The comments came in the backdrop of presentation of his government‚Äôs Rs 5.13 lakh crore budget, the state‚Äôs largest ever, which the CM ‚Äúdedicated to the youth‚Äù.‚ÄúUnder the ODOP scheme we have linked five lakh youths to banks... guarantee of employment on such a large scale is unprecedented,‚Äù said Adityanath.Under the scheme, which was launched in January 2018, one product from each of the 75 districts in UP is identified and the makers of the product ‚Äì artisans and other production units ‚Äì are promoted through loans and marketing assistance, among other means, so that employment can be generated on a district level.Adityanath has set a target of expanding UP‚Äôs economy to $1 trillion by 2024-25, from the estimated $250 billion in 2020-21, and infrastructural work is on in full swing to achieve it. The Purvanchal Expressway, India's longest expressway, is expected to be thrown open to the public from Diwali this year. While the foundation stone of the expressway was laid by Samajwadi Party during the term of the previous Akhilesh Yadav-led government, Adityanath said the BJP government has managed to make it wider and longer with lesser cost. ‚ÄúIn December 2016, the cost of the expressway that was 110 metres wide and 340 km long was Rs 15,200 crore. We are making it 120 metres wide and 341 km long and are able to make it for Rs 11,800 crore,‚Äù said Adityanath, attributing the saving to ‚Äúplugging leakages‚ÄùThe CM also said that it was through this step to do away with inconsistencies in various ongoing projects, and even scrapping some projects, that the government was able to provide money for the Rs 36,000 crore farm loan waiver after taking charge in 2017.‚ÄúOther states tried to ape our step of waiving farm loans but are now struggling to stay afloat. If you use it as a political tool without any planning and vision, it won‚Äôt be successful,‚Äù he said."
56,"Unemployment rate at 6.1 pc in 2017-18, govt cites new survey in Rajya Sabha","NEW DELHI: Unemployment rate in the country as per a new survey was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the government informed Rajya Sabha on Wednesday.Minister of State for Labour Santosh Gangwar said the government is conducting a new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with new parameters and bigger sample size, and its results cannot be compared with previous surveys in this regard.""As per the new Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by the government, the labour force participation is 36.9 per cent and the rate of unemployment for 2017-18 is 6.1 per cent,"" he said.Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the minister said the report of this survey is very different than the surveys conducted in previous years.This survey is not comparable to previous surveys, he said, adding it was an attempt to provide authentic data with the new survey conducted through the Ministry of Statistics ""We are focusing on infrastructure development and ease of doing business and India's position in the world has improved. India has improved its position to 63rd rank now in 2019 against 196 in previous years,"" he said.""Our government is very conscious of creating employment opportunities and is running such programme which generate employment.""The way our government is functioning, employment opportunities are being created and the youths are getting jobs also,"" the minister said.Gangwar said the government has stopped the previous survey as the sample size was low and an attempt is being made to improve the data by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also."
57,Reality of govt's promises is that 3.64 crore people became unemployed: Priyanka,"New Delhi: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday slammed the government over 3.64 crore people reportedly becoming unemployed in the last five years, saying this is the reason why the Modi dispensation shies away from talking about jobs Her attack on the government came over a media report which claimed that in the last five years, 3.64 crore people became unemployed in the top seven sectors.""This is the reality of all the big promises about giving jobs. Around three and a half crore people have become unemployed in seven major sectors of the country,"" Priyanka Gandhi said in a tweet in Hindi.""3 crore 64 lakh unemployed people are the result of big names and advertisements. That is why the government shies away from talking about jobs,"" the Congress general secretary said.On the occasion of Republic Day , Congress leader Rahul Gandhi also hit out at the government on Sunday saying that in the absence of employment, opportunities cannot be made available for the youth to fulfil their dreams.How can the Republic be strong in such a scenario, he had asked."
58,View: What this Budget can offer to fix India's unemployment problem,"India‚Äôs employment situation is bad. The current unemployment rate is the highest in the last 45 years. The unemployment among urban youth (age 15-29 years) is alarmingly high at 22.5 per cent. The high unemployment rates is but just one of the problems with India‚Äôs employment scenario. The labour force participation rate has come down to 46.5 per cent for those who are 15 years and above. A large proportion of the employed workers get low wage and are stuck in ‚Äòemployed poverty‚Äô trap.While structural factors are responsible for the high unemployment rate, the current slowdown has made things worse. There is enough evidence to show that the economic slowdown is a result of the decline in demand (investment and consumption). Aggregate investment has fallen below 30 per cent of the GDP, a rate much lower than the 15-year average of 35 %. More recently, private consumption has also declined. Unsurprisingly, capacity utilisation in the private sector is down to 70%.Therefore, as a first thing, the budget should focus on reviving demand. Rural India ‚Äî especially the small and marginal farmers, the landless labour ‚Äî spends most of its income on a wide range of goods and services. So, an increase in disbursements through PM-KISAN and MNREGA can provide much needed boost to demand. In the medium term, rural unemployment can be reduced through enhanced government spending on irrigation, rural roads, cold storage, and logistical chains crucial for integrating farms with mandis. These facilities along with an extensive crop insurance can drastically raise agricultural productivity and income.Another major reason behind the unemployment situation is GST-caused distress among small and medium enterprises (SMEs) who employ more than 11 crore people. GST has generated inverted duty structure (IDS) for many products whereby the tax on raw materials is higher than on the finished product. Such an imbalance reduces competitiveness of SMEs and increases cost of capital for them. Annually, around Rs 20,000 crore gets stuck with the government in the form of input tax credit. The tax has raised the cost of doing business for SMEs that act as agents of other businesses. In addition, GST on exports of intermediary services reduces their competitiveness. These anomalies in GST need to be addressed without delay.Decline in construction and related activities in urban areas is a serious concern. These activities employ more than 5 crore people. The budget should aim to revive construction activities in real estate and infrastructure sectors. These sectors directly or indirectly support economic activities in another 200 odd sectors.In this regard, the National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) programme is a welcome step. It aims to boost aggregate investment to the tune of 2-2.5 % of GDP by investing Rs 102 lakh crore in infrastructure over next five years. As much as 39 per cent of the funding is expected from the states and another 22% from the private sector. However, when state finances have taken a hit due to low GST collection and the private sector has very little appetite for risk, the Centre will have to do the heavy lifting, at least for now. Therefore, budgetary support to infrastructure should be much more than the NIP projections (at 1.11% of GDP).Moreover, the investment should be front loaded. Bidding and contracting for roads, highway, railway tracks and urban development projects is a lengthy process. Therefore, rather than rolling out new projects, for now the focus should be on raising funding for the awarded projects so as to complete them as soon as possible. The multiplier effects of infrastructure investment on growth and employment are large and extensive.Unfortunately, many projects are stuck due to various regulatory hurdles, and many others are mired in legal disputes. Regulatory uncertainty makes private investment unnecessarily risky and is the major reason behind non-availability of capital for infrastructure and other projects. The government should realise that for private investment, the regulatory certainty is as important as the cost of capital.Another important source of employment is housing projects. Here, too many projects are caught up in disputes ‚Äî contractual ones between homebuyers and developers, and legal ones between lenders and developers. To make things worse, such disputes are simultaneously taken to multiple authorities ‚Äî the RERA, NCLT and Consumer courts. Consequently, restructuring and liquidation processes have got delayed. Unsurprisingly, there is a large stock of unsold houses. Indeed, the abandoned or disputed real estate projects are a major source of problem for the NBFCs.A single legal authority should adjudicate all disputes arising from the real estate. The Rs 25,000-crore bailout fund for the sector should be put to use immediately to salvage all projects that are 80 per cent completed and are not under the NCLT process. To boost demand, the budget can raise limit for affordable housing for the purpose of tax exemption on housing loans.Finally, to reap the demographic dividend, there is a need to invest in skilling of the youth. In future most jobs will come from the private sector that prefers candidates with practical skills and work experience. However, a common perception is that it takes a college or university degree to get a good job. This misperception is the result of lack of an adequate and affordable vocational and education training program in the country.The budget can incentivise companies and industrial units to provide internship and on site vocational training to unemployed youth. This experience can be combined with distance education to teach the trainees relevant theories and concepts.In the interim, the government should fill the large number of vacant posts. Estimates suggest that there are more than 22 lakh vacancies in government departments. The country can ill-afford this neglect at a time when the unemployment rates remain very high.(The writer is Professor, Delhi School of Economics. Views expressed are personal)"

However, the Congress had also promised a monthly unemployment allowance of Rs 4,000 for youth during the assembly polls last year ‚Äì a promise that may have prompted the unemployed youth to register in larger numbers, political observers in MP said.The state government is yet to fulfill that promise and said in the assembly earlier this year that it wasn‚Äôt considering the proposal.‚ÄúThe number of registered educated unemployed in MP in October 2018 was 20,77,222 and in October 2019, it is 27,79,725,‚Äù Kamal Nath said. 17,506 youth were picked for jobs in a Job Fairs organised in the last one year while 2,520 youth were picked for jobs during placement drives, Nath said. 13,740 jobs were ‚Äúcreated‚Äù with setting up of 25 new industries in MP since the CM added.‚ÄúMP topped the list in unemployment for 15 years before our government came.

As per the latest quarterly bulletin, labour force participation rate for 15 years and above dripped to 46.5% in January-March from 46.8% in the previous quarter. Female labour force participation rate for 15 years and above also declined to 19.1% from 19.5% in the previous quarter, while those for males eased to 73.4% in January-March from 73.6% in October-December.



Labour force participation rate (LFPR) among youth (15-29 years) in the first quarter of calendar 2018 was 37.7%, lower than 38.2% in the last three months of 2018.



State-wise breakup for 15 years and above showed Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to be the worst performers with female LFPR at only 5.6% and 6%, respectively.



Still, the labour force participation rate - the percentage of population making up the labour force - which had slowly edged up between April and December last year, recorded a dip to 36% during the March quarter, the report showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.



Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.



Drinking water and sanitation

Only around 48.6% households in rural areas had exclusive access to a principal source of drinking water while 57.5% of households in urban areas had exclusive access to such a source between July and December 2018 according to an NSO report on drinking water, sanitation, hygiene and housing condition. Almost 12.3% of rural households and 9.1% of urban households did not have sufficient access to drinking water throughout the year from the principal source of water according to the survey. About 42.9% of rural households used hand pumps as the principal source of drinking water and 40.9% urban households using water piped into their dwelling as a principal source of water during the period. 56.6% of rural households had access to a bathroom while 91.2% of urban households had access to a bathroom during the period with 50.3% of rural households and 75% of urban households having exclusive access to a bathroom during the period.



Education

The literacy rate in India among people above the age of seven was 77.7% between July 2017 and June 2018, the NSO said in a separate report. Literacy in rural areas was lower at 73.5% compared to 87.7% in urban areas. Around 13.6% of Indians between the ages of 3 and 35 never enrolled in school with 15.7% of people living in rural Indian never enrolling and 8.3% of people living in urban areas never enrolling for education. The average expenditure during the academic year for students between ages 3-35 pursuing a general course was Rs 5,240 in urban areas and Rs 16,308 in urban areas while average expenditure for a technical or professional course was Rs 32,137 in rural areas and Rs 64,763 in urban areas.



Health

Average medical expenditure per hospitalisation case (excluding childbirth) in rural India about was Rs 16,676 in rural areas and Rs 26,475 in urban India. As per the survey report on Household social consumption related to health, the expenditure in government hospitals was about about Rs 4,290 in rural and Rs 4,837 in urban areas per hospitalisation between July 2017 and June 2018.



However, in private hospitals the expenditure was about about Rs 27,347 in rural and Rs 38,822 in urban area per instance of hospitalization. Private hospiatals accounted for 55% of all hospitalisations excluding those for childbirth and public hospitals accounted for 42% of such hospitalisations. Only about 14% of the rural population and 19% of the urban population reported that they had adequate health expenditure coverage with 13% of the rural population and 9% of the urban population reporting that they were covered by government sponsored insurance. Only around 59% of boys and 60% of girls under the age of five received all eight prescribed vaccinations, even though 97% of both boys and girls in rural India had received some vaccinations and 98% of boys and 97% of girls had received vaccinations in urban India.



Persons with disabilities

In India, the prevalence of disability (percentage of persons with disability in the population) was 2.2% with 2.3% in rural and 2% in urban areas in July-December 2018.



Prevalence of disability was higher among males than females. Among males, prevalence of disability was 2.4% while it was 1.9% among females. These were the findings of an NSO Survey of Persons with Disabilities during July-December 2018. Prior to this, survey on the same subject was carried out by NSO from July-December 2002.



Among persons with disabilities of age 7 years and above, 52.2% were literate. Among persons with disabilities of age 15 years and above, Labour Force Participation Rate in usual status was 23.8% while the unemployment rate was 4.2%, the survey report showed.

64,"More reforms needed to boost jobs, incomes: OECD","NEW DELHI: India is set for a modest recovery after a loss of momentum as reforms to simplify taxation, lighten business regulations and upgrade infrastructure start to bear fruit, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) said on Thursday, even as it pushed for reforms to create jobs and improve public welfare.Growth in Asia's third largest economy will slowdown to 5.8% in 2019 but would recover to 6.2% in 2020 and 6.4% in 2021, the OECD said in its ‚ÄòEconomic Survey of India‚Äô report. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday kept its key lending rate unchanged and sharply lowered its gross domestic product GDP ) growth forecast to 5% from 6.1%, while maintaining an ""accommodative"" policy stance.India's economy grew 6.8% in FY19. But economic expansion slowed to 4.5% in July-September, the weakest pace in more than six years, from 5% in the June quarter.‚ÄúHowever, this slower pace of growth underlines the need to fully implement existing reforms and continue lowering barriers to trade to generate the investment and jobs India needs to raise living standards across the country,"" said OECD chief economist Laurence Boone.The OECD report noted that India has greatly expanded its participation in global trade in recent years but private investment remains relatively weak, employment rate has declined amid a shortage of quality jobs, rural incomes are stagnating, and per capita income varies considerably across states.‚ÄúFurther reforms to modernise the economy are now needed to drive the creation of high-quality jobs, as well as measures to improve public services and welfare,‚Äù it said.Speaking at the launch of the report, chief economic adviser to the government Krishnamurthy Subramanian said global economic growth is significantly low, which is having an impact on India as well.‚ÄúThe global economy today is at one of its significantly low points... the current lull is particularly exasperated by a consistent attempt to downgrade the power of multilateralism,‚Äù he said.As per the report, restoring growth to the higher levels needed to provide ample jobs and ease inequality will require accelerating the pace of structural reforms to revive investment and exports.Monetary policy should remain accommodative as long as inflation is set to remain comfortably close to the target, the survey said. It called for India to ‚Äúimprove transparency‚Äù in off-budget transactions and its contingent liabilities as the government deficit-to-GDP ratio has declined but public spending programmes are being financed off the budget.‚ÄúEstablishing a fiscal council would help monitor progress toward fiscal targets and bring transparency,‚Äù the Paris-based organisation said. This comes after the government included extra budgetary resources, comprising fully-serviced government bonds, in the budget estimates for 2019-20.India‚Äôs public debt-to-GDP ratio remains relatively high, the survey said. Although the central government deficit and state deficits have declined, off-budget financing has increased, it said.Reducing restrictions to services trade imposed by trading partners and by India on imports would further boost trade in services, also giving a lift to manufacturing and the general economy.The OECD estimates suggest India would be the biggest beneficiary of a multilateral cut in services trade restrictions. Even without a multilateral agreement, moving alone to overhaul regulations would have a positive impact.Doing more to simplify complex labour laws ‚Äì many of which discourage hiring by becoming binding as firms grow above stated thresholds ‚Äì would help raise the share of quality jobs demanded by a fastgrowing and well-educated youth population in a country where the vast majority of employment is informal."
65,Worst unemployment in decades strains Indian consumer loans,"Credit analysts are keeping a watchful eye on signs of stress in Indian household debt after unemployment rose to a 45-year high and as lenders grapple with the worst soured debt levels of any major economy.India‚Äôs bad debt malaise has centered on corporate debt, and loans to individuals have been seen as safer and a growth opportunity for banks. Given the slowdown in the economy and a drying-up of credit from shadow banks, analysts are signaling potential risks, though publicly available data on personal loan arrears is sparse.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs stress building up for sure in retail loans,‚Äù said Saswata Guha, director for financial institutions at Fitch Ratings. ‚ÄúWhether it manifests into higher defaults will depend on how the economy shapes from here.‚ÄùThe government last week unveiled steps ranging from concessions on vehicle purchases to hastening of capital infusion in state-run banks to help re-ignite an economy that‚Äôs slowed sharply on the back of weak consumption. Defaults have increased funding pressure at India‚Äôs non-bank financiers -- historically an important provider of consumer loans . That‚Äôs curtailing their ability to provide loans, and having knock-on effects for consumption, according to Fitch.Non-performing retail loans rose to 5.3% of the total retail lending book at State Bank of India -- the nation‚Äôs biggest lender -- at the end of June from 4.8% in the previous quarter. The bank has expressed confidence it can control any slippages this quarter.‚ÄúWe could see trouble among individuals to repay their loans if the stress in the Indian economy rises,‚Äù said Dwijendra Srivastava, chief investment officer of debt at Sundaram Asset Management Co. in Mumbai. ‚ÄúBusinesses in India aren‚Äôt doing well, so it may directly hit employment and in turn the ability to repay loans.‚Äù"
66,"'Modinomics' stinks so bad, govt has to hide its own reports: Rahul gandhi","Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday over an official survey which reportedly points to a fall in consumer spending and said "" Modinomics stinks so bad"", the government has to hide its own reports.A media report cited the latest consumption expenditure survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO) to claim that consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening rural demand.The report also claimed the NSO report was approved to be released on June 19, 2019, but was withheld by the government agency owing to its ""adverse"" findings.""Modinomics stinks so bad, the Govt has to hide its own reports,"" Gandhi said in a tweet, tagging the news report."
67,"Jobs growth slows in past 2 years, core companies hit hard","New Delhi: The pace of employment growth in India slowed in the last two years with job creation growing at 3.9% in 2017-18 and 2.8% in 2018-19, a study by ratings agency CARE Ratings showed.Based on a set of 1,938 companies spread across sectors, the study said the value of sales in FY19 was Rs 69 lakh crore, thus covering the entire corporate sector. It includes all listed public sector entities but the SME segment may find less representation in this sample.As per the study, the aggregate headcount or employment increased at a CAGR of 3.3% over a four-year period from 2014-15 to 2018-19 compared with a CAGR of 7.5% in gross domestic product (GDP) during this period.Growth in employment on an annual basis was 2.5% in 2015-16 and 4.1% in 2016-17. The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released in May showed the unemployment rate at 6.1% in FY18, a 45-year high, but the government said this was not comparable with earlier years because of the change in methodology.‚ÄúTherefore, there is a case that supports the argument that employment growth has not been commensurate with GDP growth with a difference of 4.2% in CAGR during this period,‚Äù the study showed.It showed that around half the companies had witnessed a decline in growth in employment over this period while 35% of them had witnessed growth of 11.5% on the aggregate, each with an above average CAGR of 3.3%.CORE WORRIESThe ratings agency highlighted that core industries have witnessed ‚Äúvirtually negative growth in headcount‚Äù, with crude oil just about maintaining the employment level. These industries have been impacted by the slowdown in GDP growth as well as the challenges on the NPA side for banks.A similar picture is seen for the heavy investment industries where growth has tended to be negative for power and capital goods, and just 0.4% for infrastructure.However, consumer-oriented industries showed a varied patter."
68,Unemployment rate among Indian women more than double of men: Study,"NEW DELHI: The unemployment rate among women in India is more than double of that of men with similar qualifications, a new study has revealed.Titled "" Gender Inclusion in Hiring in India"", the study by two Harvard students, Rachel Levenson and Layla O'Kane, noted that 8.7 per cent of working-age urban, educated women in the country are unemployed but only 4 per cent of comparable men find themselves without a job.""While there are many factors that influence a woman's decision and ability to find work, the gender gap in the unemployment rate along with ILO (International Labour Organisation) research suggest that women, particularly highly-educated ones, face additional barriers as compared to men in accessing jobs,"" it said.Levenson and O'Kane's analysis is based on close to 200 India-based jobs for which Shortlist, a hiring firm in India, had provided the recruiting platform between 2016 and 2017. It included 286,991 applications from 211,004 applicants (some people applied to multiple jobs).According to the study, while discrimination based on gender is illegal under the Indian constitution, conversations with hiring managers and other labour market experts have revealed that there is gender discrimination in the hiring process across the country, as is the case around the world.The study looks at three stages at which women may face barriers during hiring -- qualifications and experience, recruitment and choice to apply, and application process, while suggesting tools to increase gender diversity in the Indian workforce.It highlighted the need for gender inclusive work places by correlating it with ""higher levels of performance and innovation"".""Inclusive hiring improves firm-level growth by allowing companies to attract and retain top talent and better serving consumers in markets or sectors where women are a key customer segment,"" it said.The study also noted that increasing female participation in the labour force could increase the Indian GDP by 27 per cent.Not dismissing the progress, albeit little, that several multinational corporations in the country have made towards minimising gender discrimination at work place over the past couple of decades, it highlighted the role technology could play in improving hiring outcomes including increasing the number of women who apply and get shortlisted for jobs.""We know that diverse teams perform better, and we're encouraged by these results because they show that even small and medium sized businesses, and not just large enterprises, can leverage technology to increase the diversity of their candidate pools,"" said Simon Desjardins, Co-founder of Shortlist.The study suggested competency-based assessments, behavioral nudges in recruitment, and well-designed job descriptions, for creating a more effective bias-reducing, gender-sensitive hiring process in India."
69,Data leak of unemployment figures serious: Govt,"The government Thursday admitted in the Rajya Sabha that there has been a data leak of unemployment figures and said efforts were being made to ascertain who was behind it.Replying to queries during Question Hour, Minister of State for Planning and Statistics Rao Inderjit Singh termed the issue as ""serious"" and said data pertaining to unemployment figures was leaked ahead of its announcement in May this year.He also informed members that the government has changed the methodology for ascertaining unemployment rates as a periodic survey is now being held every year based on quarterly data, against the five-year surveys earlier.""It is right that there was a data leak. Our survey result was to come out on May 30, 2019, but before that the data was leaked. We have taken this very seriously. Maybe someone has an agenda behind it and the data was leaked. We are making efforts to ascertain who was behind the leak,"" the minister told members.He said employment and unemployment rate surveys used to be held once in five years. ""This government deemed it fit to carry out a periodic survey every year,"" he said.Singh said some changes were also made in the methodology and technology was used and that is why there is a difference in previous surveys done by NSSO He said the 2.2 unemployment rate would have been same as brought out by the NSSO earlier if it was made out for five years, but this has increased both in rural and urban areas as the methodology has changed.""The new model for labour employment and unemployment is different from early methods and you cannot compare apples with oranges.""The new method now is a yearly method taking into account quarterly surveys. The only comparability that can happen is when the next year data comes. At present, it was compared to 6.1 per cent and the yearly data cannot be compared with the 5-year figure,"" he said.The minister said the government takes unemployment very ""very seriously"" and to alleviate the unemployment scenario, the government has taken a number of steps.Listing out some examples, he said the prime minister's employment generation programme itself has catered to employment of 14.3 lakh till November 30, 2018, the Deen Dayal Gramin Kaushal Yojna has helped 4.73 lakh people get jobs, MNREGA over past 3.5 to 4 has helped 972.99 person employment days.""Taking into account the seriousness of the matter, the government has set up a cabinet committee on employment and skill development to ensure that more people get jobs,"" he said.In his written reply, the minister said, this Ministry has launched a new regular Employment-Unemployment survey, namely, Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) during 2017-18 with certain changes in survey methodology, data collection mechanism and sampling design vis--vis the earlier quinquennial (once in every five years) Employment and Unemployment surveys of NSSO.These differences in methodology put certain limitations in respect of comparability of results of PLFS with results of the earlier quinquennial surveys on EmploymentUnemployment conducted by NSS, he said.""Based on the first estimates, available from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS), released on 31st May 2019, unemployment rate in usual status is 6.1 percent,"" he said."
70,Unemployment among educated at 11.4%: Govt,"The government, on Monday, said unemployment rate of educated persons in the country was at 11.4%. This is much higher than the average unemployment rate in the country at 6.1% based on the Periodic Labour Force Survey the findings of which were made public very recently.‚ÄúAs per the results of Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Sample Survey Office, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation during 2017-18, the estimated unemployment rate of educated persons (secondary & above) on usual basis in the country was 11.4%,‚Äù labour minister Santosh Kumar Gangwar said in a reply in Lok Sabha on Monday.‚ÄúEmployment generation coupled with improving employability is the priority of the government,‚Äù Gangwar said.According to Gangwar, government has taken various steps for generating employment in the country like encouraging private sector of economy, fast-tracking various projects involving substantial investment and increasing public expenditure on schemes such as Prime Minister‚Äôs Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP), Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), Pt. Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana (DDU-GKY) and Deendyal Antodaya Yojana-National Urban Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NULM)."

22-year-old Jaspal was a struggling salesman from Rudiyan, a small village in Uttar Pradesh, when tragedy befell his family. His farmer father passed away and subsequently, his elder brother decided to separate himself from the family making Jaspal the sole earning member. Jaspal, who had finished his graduation despite many financial woes, always believed that there wasn‚Äôt much scope for jobs in his village. However, when the sole responsibility of the family, which included his younger sister and his mother, fell on his shoulders, he was forced to find a decent means of livelihood there.This is when Jaspal was introduced to Minimum Investment Maximum Outcome (MIMO) Technologies through his former colleague Usman. MIMO, a Delhi-based four-year-old firm, is dedicated to empower citizens living in rural and semi-urban areas by providing digital literacy and employing them in various sectors such as logistics, distribution and onboarding customers. Through this initiative, MIMO plays a dual role for both- unemployed rural citizens and enterprises who are looking to fulfil the last-mile deliveries to villages and remote areas of the country.The idea of MIMO took shape when Lathika Raghunathan, 41, returned to India after years of working abroad in software development firm and witnessed the huge disparity between rural and urban markets and the need for the rural youth to be gainfully employed. She had previously worked in the areas of financial inclusion in the Latin American markets and was seeking a similar solution for Indian rural markets. MIMO was hence formed and incorporated in October 2015 with the dual aim of facilitating enterprises with last-mile delivery and helping the rural population become a part of India‚Äôs financial inclusion agenda.Notably, the unemployment rate in India during 2017-2018 has been found to be a 45-year high at 6.1%, as per the data released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation this month. In rural India, 3.8% of women and 5.8% of men are unemployed. Among these, the unemployment rate ranged between 9.7% to 15.2% for educated rural females between 2004-05 to 2011-12, which increased to 17.3% in 2017-18. For rural, educated males, the joblessness rate jumped to 10.5% in 2017-18 from 3.5-4.4% between 2004-05 to 2011-12.On the other hand, many enterprises, often find it difficult to enter semi-urban and rural markets due to cultural differences, lack of local language expertise, risk of cash handling, poor infrastructure and operational issues.To address this gap, MIMO came up with a smart solution. As the country is adopting the digital technology at a very high pace, the startup believes that the unemployed and the uneducated can achieve financial independence by learning to become a part of the digital world.‚ÄúOnce they are skilled to use technology effectively, they become contributors to providing solutions to established enterprises,‚Äù Raghunathan said, adding that through MIMO‚Äôs help the rural citizens do not have to migrate to cities to find jobs and can work from the village itself.The rural employees, also known as the field agents/officers, range from school/college dropouts to someone who simply have time in his/her hands. They are trained to learn about quality and delivery parameters.MIMO works on a similar model as that of Uber and through its mobile app, the rural field agents carry out tasks given by enterprises. The app is easy to use and overcomes the language barrier as it comes in all vernacular languages. The agents have the liberty to select the tasks and depending on the tasks, the agents can earn to Rs 30,000-Rs 40,000 per month. Notably, the average monthly income in rural households ranges between Rs 7,000 to Rs 8,500, as per NABARD ‚Äôs All India Rural Financial Inclusion Survey [2016-2017].Some of these tasks include data verification for banks and other companies in rural areas, delivering products to unchartered territories for e-commerce companies, bill payments, form submissions, surveys, and e-KYC collection, among others.According to All India Trade Online Vendors Association, the biggest hurdle for an e-commerce platform is cash collection. In rural areas, there is always the risk of a field agent running away with the money or taking his own time to pay the retailer, thereby causing a delay in cash collection. This is why many e-commerce platforms refuse to offer ‚Äòcash on delivery‚Äô option in rural or semi-urban areas. However, MIMO makes the agent pay the money to the former through his own pocket in advance. The agent pre-load the amount in the MIMO mobile wallet and once the firm has received the money in advance, it then allows the agent to collect the money from the customer which he keeps as his own. All the transactions are recorded digitally in order to bring transparency in the system.Further, to ensure a smooth and error-free service, MIMO‚Äôs in-house technology tracks and monitors the rural agents‚Äô task and the status is shared with every party at every step.For document submission and form filings, the field agents are trained to use tools like QR and OCR to digitalise relevant documents. Here, the technology also allows for geo-tagging and taking audio/video/still pictures of the documents with watermark and tags to prevent the chances of fraud and data theft.MIMO claims to have completed over 530,000 transactions since its launch and averages over $1,000,000 per month in gross transactional value.The startup has currently more than 3300 active field officers covering rural and semi-urban areas in over 4700 unique rural locations. The rural agents have served in places like Raichur (Karnataka), Bhilwara (Rajasthan), Kalandhar Garhi (UP), and Jaisighpura Khor (Rajasthan) and covered 12 states including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, etc. It is currently working with 21 established clients- Myntra, Aditya Birla Finance, Hero Fincorp, Ratnakar Bank Ltd, ShoeKonnect, Satin Creditcore, to name a few.‚ÄúFor long, enterprises have looked at their interventions in the rural sector mainly as CSR activities. They have shied away from looking at rural areas as successful marketing avenues. Through MIMO, we are showcasing that working in the rural and semi urban markets can be profitable and should not be seen only as a CSR campaign,‚Äù said Raghunathan.What does MIMO get out of this? A 20% commission from every task performed by the field agents and the firm generated nearly Rs 3 crore in FY2018-2019.In 2017, MIMO received angel funding of Rs 3.5 crore by Yukti Group . Ashish Chand, partner at Yukti Securities told ET, ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs rural segment is continually becoming the focus of every company's market strategy. However, companies struggle to bridge the huge gap that exists between urban and rural markets. Challenges such as accessibility to interior locations and variance in local languages top the chart. MIMO fills this gap via their on-ground native workforce, which takes companies right into the interiors of untapped rural India.‚ÄùMIMO now plans to expand to all rural and semi-urban locations, covering all unique pin codes in India by 2022, and is in the process of providing earning opportunities to more than 1 million people, said Raghunathan.Meanwhile, Jaspal is currently earning Rs 15,000 per month and is about to reach Rs. 20,000 within a few months. He is on the verge of becoming one of the highest earners in his village."
72,"Unemployment major challenge, MSMEs must create 5 crore jobs to achieve USD 5 trillion economy: Nitin Gadkari","NEW DELHI: Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said on Friday that unemployment is a major challenge and MSMEs must create five crore jobs in five years to address the issue as India aims to become a USD 5-trillion economy.Currently, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) contribute 29 per cent to the country's gross domestic product (GDP) and have created 11 crore jobs in recent years.Stating that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target of India becoming a USD 5-trillion economy, the Union transport and MSME minister said MSMEs will have to raise their contribution to GDP to 50 per cent and also create five crore more jobs in the next five years to achieve this objective.""Unemployment is the biggest challenge facing us. Eleven crore jobs have been created and you (MSMEs) have to generate 5 crore more jobs in the country in five years,"" he said at the 6th India International MSME Expo here.Moreover, he said the government has taken several steps towards addressing key challenges faced by MSMEs, including in marketing of their products and ensuring timely payments to them.Highlighting that e-commerce firm Alibaba had a major role in China's economic growth, Gadkari said the MSME ministry has signed an agreement with the Government e-Market (GeM) portal under the commerce ministry to establish India's new e-commerce marketing portal.The new portal may be named 'Bharat Craft', he said, adding that the online platform will be of the scale of Amazon and Alibaba.The government, he added, has set a target for the proposed portal to achieve a turnover of at least Rs 10 lakh crore in the next two years.To ensure timely payments to MSMEs and prevent erosion of their working capital, Gadkari said the government is ""seriously exploring"" if it can bring a legislation to ensure payments within 45 days of supplying a product.The minister said he has spoken to global multilateral lending agencies like the World Bank Asian Development Bank and KfW to see if the cost of capital can be brought down for the MSME sector, one of the largest job creator in the country.The three-day MSME expo at Pragati Maidan opened on Friday."
73,RBI study: Over 50% of Indians feel job scene is getting worse,"The Reserve Bank of India ‚Äôs monthly Consumer Confidence Survey for September shows deep pessimism about the employment situation among Indian households. For the first time ever since September 2012, when this index came into being, a majority of respondents (52.5%) felt the employment situation had worsened. As for the coming year, 33.4% said the situation would only get worse, again the highest proportion ever voicing this feeling.About their own income, 26.7% said it had decreased. Only once before, in November 2017, had a higher proportion of respondents (28%) perceived their income as having dropped.Despite this, a majority (53%) anticipate an increase in income in the coming year; only 9.6% feel it will go down. On the whole, therefore, people are more sanguine about their own prospects than about the larger economy.On the overall economic situation, almost half (47.9%) of the households surveyed felt it had worsened. The last time a higher proportion than this had expressed such a view was in December 2013, when 54% had said the economy had worsened.More worryingly, 31.8% felt the situation will only worsen further in the coming year. Not since Sep 2013, when 38.6% expressed this view, has the proportion with a gloomy outlook on the near future been so high.The view on prices is middling, with almost three-quarters perceiving inflation as having risen and just over three-quarters feeling it will go up further a year down the line. These, however, are not unusual proportions when it comes to perceptions about inflation as the data from the past shows.The perceptions about the overall economic situation also seem to be influencing people‚Äôs spending choices, with the proportions of those reporting that their spending on non-essential items had gone down or had remained the same being the highest since Sep 2015, from which month this data is available. For the first time, over a quarter of those surveyed (26%) said their spending on non-essentials would go down in the coming year. That‚Äôs bad news for an economy already struggling to cope with a demand crunch.Interestingly, the perception is that spending on essentials is already higher than it used to be and will only increase further in the year ahead. Taken in conjunction with the perception on inflation, this could explain why people believe they are spending less on discretionary items and are likely to continue to do so.The survey was conducted in 13 major cities. These included the eight largest metros ‚Äì Delhi , Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad ‚Äì and seven other state capitals in Bhopal, Guwahati, Jaipur, Lucknow , Patna and Thiruvananthapuram.

There is no dearth of jobs in the country, but people want stable and government jobs, he added.To a query on decline in jobs in the informal sector, the Minister said: ""We have no information on decline in the informal sector.""After the government came to power, it is working more proactively in this area.The government is very active in creating employment, he said, adding that in the formal sector, there has been increase in jobs by 1 crore each year.He was also asked if job seekers are getting the benefit after the government removed interview process for some category of government jobs.The Minister said: Interview is scrapped for D category posts, it is benefitting. About 10-12 per cent jobs are getting vacant each year, we are in the process of filling them up. It takes one year to offer a job in this process.""On the demand to set up an institutional mechanism to maintain a consolidated data of vacancies and potential recruitment in the country, Gangwar said there is a set system in place for government jobs.""In the last five years under UPSC and SSE, 2,45,470 government jobs were offered. That apart, the government recruiting agencies are also filling up posts. We make efforts to give information about the recruitment from time to time,"" he added."
75,12.19 lakh new jobs created in June: ESIC payroll data,"NEW DELHI: Around 12.19 lakh jobs were created in June, lower than 12.88 lakh added in the previous month, according to the latest payroll data from the Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).Gross enrolments of new subscribers with the ESIC were 1.49 crore during 2018-19, a report released by National Statistical Office (NSO) stated.The NSO report is based on the payroll data of new subscribers of various social security schemes run by ESIC, retirement fund body EPFO and the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).The NSO has been releasing the payroll data or new subscribers data of these three bodies since April 2018 covering a period starting from September 2017.The report showed that gross new enrolments with the ESIC during September 2017 to March 2018 were 86.73 lakh.It showed that a net of 12.36 lakh new enrolments with the Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) were recorded in June, higher as compared with 8.56 lakh in May this year.During 2018-19, 61.12 lakh new subscribers on a net basis joined the social security schemes run by the EPFO. Similarly, the net new enrolments were 15.52 lakh during September 2017 to March 2018.It said that since the number of subscribers are from various sources, there are elements of overlap and the estimates are not additive.The NSO said in the report that the present report gives different perspectives on the levels of employment in the formal sector and does not measure employment at a holistic level."
76,"Is the job scene in India bad? Depends on how you see it, says govt","India‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 6.1% in FY18, official data showed, highlighting the challenge that confronts the Narendra Modi-led government. The data isn‚Äôt comparable with that of past years, the government contended, in effect seeking to refute previous leaked reports that said they showed the unemployment rate was at a 45-year high.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) released on Friday showed the unemployment rate in the country in FY18 was at 5.3% in rural India and 7.8% in urban India, resulting in overall unemployment rate of 6.1%.‚ÄúIt is a new design, new metric. It would be unfair to compare it with the past,‚Äù said chief statistician Pravin Srivastava.‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt do a retrospective analysis based on the previous methodology ‚Äî there was no (political) pressure,‚Äù said chief statistician Pravin Srivastava.He said this meant the data weren‚Äôt comparable. ‚ÄúWhen we change the matrix, it is very difficult to measure (compare) because there is no means to do a retrospective analysis in that year based on earlier matrix.‚Äù‚ÄúForty-five-year high or low is your interpretation,‚Äù Srivastava said. ‚ÄúThe earlier data was captured using monthly per capita income to measure unemployment ‚Äî now education is the criteria.‚ÄùHe also said the release of the report had not been postponed. ‚ÄúWe have not delayed the report, we have only brought in new information.‚ÄùThe data for PLFS for January to March will be released next month, Srivastava said.‚ÄúWe have brought two quarterly data on labour survey. We are coming out with consumption expenditure survey for 2017-18. We are expecting it in June. You can then compare unemployment captured by that survey with PLFS,‚Äù Srivastava said.A leaked media report on the PLFS finding in January had said the unemployment rate in India was highest in FY18 at 6.1%, leading to a furore as the country headed for elections with the Opposition accusing the government of suppressing the data.The Niti Aayog subsequently said it was a draft report that had been leaked without verification of the data. The controversy raised questions over the autonomy and credibility of the National Statistical Commission (NSC). Two members of the NSC resigned following the leaked report.‚ÄúThere is no problem with the credibility and autonomy of NSC,‚Äù Srivastava said on Friday.‚ÄúThe NSC makes its recommendation, but the ministry has to consider it. The NSC has the role to see the statistical system in entirety in addition to statistics ministry and states,‚Äù he said, adding that there is no change in the functioning of the ministry.‚ÄúThe restructuring of the ministry was approved by the Cabinet. NSC is at an arm‚Äôs length to the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). The internal restructuring has no impact on NSC,‚Äù he said.Former chief statistician Pronab Sen said the government will have to look at ways to revive the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector to create more jobs. ‚ÄúThe quarterly GDP data is based on corporates who do not provide jobs. It is the MSME sector which has the potential to absorb jobs being shed by agriculture, and hence the focus should be on MSMEs,‚Äù he said.Highlighting the difference between the PLFS and the earlier quinquennial surveys conducted every five years, the MoSPI said the older assessments used paper forms to collect information on different aspects of the labour force. In the PLFS, information has been collected from all members of sample households using the computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) method with inbuilt validation rules through tablets.According to Srivastava, another way to look at unemployment is through the consumption expenditure survey for the FY18, the results of which will be out by June end.The highest unemployment rate was witnessed among urban females at 10.8% followed by males in urban India at 7.1%, rural males at 5.8% and 3.8% in rural females.The survey was conducted in 12,773 first-stage units (7,014 villages and 5,759 urban blocks) covering 102,113 households (56,108 in rural areas and 46,005 in urban areas) and enumerating 433,339 persons (246,809 in rural areas and 186,530 in urban areas).Explaining the rationale behind the high unemployment rate, MoSPI said that with the rise in education and household income, aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen.‚ÄúThus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or workforce requiring low skills and low remuneration,‚Äù it said in a statement.According to MoSPI, there are various facets to the labour scenario and no single data source is complete by itself.‚ÄúThese data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market,‚Äù it said, adding that the ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), Employees‚Äô State Insurance Corp (ESIC) and National Pension System (NPS) to give an assessment of changes in the formal employment market."
77,Piyush Goyal shuns private sources showing high unemployment,"NEW DELHI: Railways and coal minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday said there has been a significant increase in employment opportunities, but the current methods of data collection have failed to adequately capture this trend. He dismissed numbers given by private sources that showed a high level of unemployment.Goyal told an event organised by CII that a host of new-age industries have come up which have improved the livelihood of the people without necessarily translating into a concomitant pick-up in employment as they are not getting captured in the formal payroll data.Data generated from government employment exchanges reflects an unemployment level of 4%, he said, questioning the numbers by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), which pegged unemployment at 7.4% ‚Äî a 27-month high ‚Äî in December. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know where the CMIE gets its data from. While people have been talking (about it), we still do not know where or what is the extrapolation of data,‚Äù he said.Goyal said the CMIE data was ‚Äútotally at variance with‚Äù that of the government‚Äôs, which is based on data collected by the labour ministry and the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO).He said the government may look to combine data collected by industry bodies with its own to create a more robust picture of employment."
78,Only 13% employers in India have hiring plans July-September quarter: Survey,"With India's job market undergoing a transition, only 13 per cent of employers across the country indicate upbeat hiring plans for the next three months, while 61 per cent anticipate no change in their payrolls, a survey said Monday.According to the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey, while 13 per cent of employers expect to increase payrolls, none forecast a decrease, 61 per cent anticipate no change and 26 per cent were unsure about any change in payrolls, resulting in a net employment outlook of 13 per cent.Hiring intentions marginally declined by four percentage points when compared with the year ago period (July-September quarter of 2018).""According to ManpowerGroup's survey, India's job market, overall, looks consistent, although it is still going through the transition with a slight slowdown in employment,"" ManpowerGroup India Associate Director Marketing Cynthia Gokhale said.Sector-wise, the services sector is expected to drive the third quarter job markets with a net employment outlook of 16 per cent, followed by the mining and construction, wholesale and retail trade and manufacturing sectors with outlooks of 11 per cent.Gokhale further said that some of the major trends that will drive recruitment in 2019 in India, are diversity, automated recruitment, virtual reality, and remote working options among others.""Over the last few months, the landscape of the recruitment industry in India has changed. The HR field is also going through an automation revamp,"" Gokhale said.In a regional comparison, employers in the southern and western regions lead hiring expectations.Gokhale further noted that ""with more than a million unemployable graduates that the Indian universities are churning out every year and thousands of jobs disappearing each year, India now must prioritise investing in education to bridge the skill gap between the requirements in the market and job seekers skill sets"".ManpowerGroup interviewed over 59,000 employers in 44 countries and territories to forecast labour market activity in the third quarter of 2019, including 4,951 employers in India.Globally, employers expect workforce gains in 43 of 44 countries and territories surveyed in the period up to the end of September.In a comparison with the same period last year, hiring intentions strengthen in 12 countries and territories, but weaken in 26 and are unchanged in six, the survey said.The strongest hiring sentiment is reported in Japan, Croatia, Taiwan, the US, Greece and Slovenia, while the weakest hiring prospects are reported for Hungary, Argentina, Italy and Spain, it added."
79,It‚Äôs now official: Joblessness rises with education level,"NEW DELHI: Only 2.1% of illiterate urban men were unemployed in 2017-18, but 9.2% of men with at least secondary education didn‚Äôt have a job. The gap was even wider among urban women ‚Äî 0.8% of those uneducated were jobless whereas 20% of women with secondary or higher education were not employed.The Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) released by the National Statistics Office (NSO) on Friday shows the unemployment rate (% of labour force without a job) rising by up to four times between urban women who have only middle-school education and those educated up to secondary school or more (see table). Unemployment in rural areas shows a similar pattern, though the degree of skewness is less.The unemployment rate didn‚Äôt rise only with education level , it has also risen over time. The NSO‚Äôs Friday release also provides unemployment data for 2004-5, 2009-10 and 2011-12, adding a caution that past data shouldn‚Äôt be compared with 2017-18 figures because of several methodological changes introduced in the latest round of the survey.Even if exact figures are not to be compared across the four years, the broad trend across time is of rise in joblessness with level of education. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a surprise, we have known of the rising phenomenon of educated unemployment for some time. It‚Äôs just an official confirmation,‚Äù said Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India Mahesh Vyas, CEO of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, says, ‚ÄúA generation ago it was inconceivable to get a job in the organised sectors without a graduation degree. Today the minimum education required to get a job in the organised sectors is much lower and is dropping.‚Äù CMIE has been conducting monthly job surveys since a few years. The PLFS report defined educated persons as those who have attained educational level of secondary and above.‚Äò15 may be too young an age to check for unemployment status‚ÄôThe study among the educated is restricted to persons of the age of 15 years and above. Some experts believe 15 may be too young an age to check for employment status, especially in urban areas.‚ÄúIt is possible that the unemployment rate should be higher in younger age brackets as a typical educated urban youth may not even start working before 23 to 24 years until he or she completes postgraduation,‚Äù says Soumya Kanti Ghosh, group chief economic adviser at Stae Bank of India .For the survey, a person aged between 15-29 years was considered as a youth."
80,India‚Äôs GDP growth hits 5-year low: D-Street wants govt to fix economy on a war footing,"NEW DELHI: Narendra Modi ‚Äôs second innings as Prime Minister kicked off on a rather sour note after a government data showed that India's economy grew at 5.8 per cent in January-March period, its slowest pace in five years.The slowdown will put pressure on the newly-appointed government and Nirmala Sitharaman , who assumed charge as the finance minister on Friday.Moreover, unemployment rate rose to 6.1 per cent in the 2017/18 fiscal year, the statistics ministry said, matching data earlier leaked to a newspaper that said it was the highest level in at least 45 years, Reuters reported.Economic Affairs Secretary Subhash Chandra Garg attributed the GDP slowdown to the NBFC crisis.""Slow down in the fourth quarter GDP was due to temporary factors like stress in NBFC sector affecting consumption finance. First quarter of current fiscal (2019-20) would also witness relatively slow growth and from second quarter onward it will pick up,"" Garg told reporters.Garg, who also holds the charge as Finance Secretary, said that capital investment, including private investment, is expected to pick up.Here‚Äôs how Dalal Street experts and economics reacted to the GDP numbers:The figure is lower-than-expected and does push the case for a 50-basis point cut and more measures from the RBI . We are looking at measures to boost liquidity from the central bank.In the immediate future, the new finance minister will have to worry about revenue collection, and so she might have to take the divestment route in the near term to ensure that she is on track on the fiscal deficit front.On the taxation front, she will have to ensure proper collection and curbs on leakages. On a long-term basis, she will have to look at an overhaul of the entire system to get the economy back on track.Key segments such as agriculture, industry and manufacturing indicate slowdown. Also, the weakening jobs scenario with urban unemployment rate at 7.8 per cent and rural at 5.3 per cent are significant causes of concern. However, the fiscal deficit at 3.4 per cent of GDP, was largely in line with expectations and can be a seen as a silver lining.Considering indicative data points and scenario, we expect gradual recovery from H2FY20, led by decent monsoon , pickup in consumptions coupled with impetus from monetary policy and measures in upcoming full union budget.In light of this number, we expect some downside bias to our FY20 growth estimate of 7.2%, and the next print for Q1FY20 is also likely to be fairly weak. Against the backdrop of a benign inflation trajectory and sharp slowdown in growth, we expect the MPC to cut rates at the June meeting. The continued focus on reforms by the government and easing financial conditions are likely to support growth in the second half of the current fiscalGrowth rate of GDP indicates that slowdown in economy is much more serious than what the market feared. We expect the new government to take serious measures regarding farmers and booster for manufacturing sector.We expect the RBI may cut interest rates by 50 bps in light of this data. Market may react negatively and trade negatively testing the support at 11,600.Slowdown in growth was anticipated, but the actual outcome undershot our sub-consensus estimate. Breakdown affirms that consumption slowdown spilled over into manufacturing activity. This increases the likelihood of another sub-6% in Q1FY20, aggravated by adverse base effects. Downside risks have risen to our FY20 GDP estimate of 7%, even as some of the transient weakness corrects itself in 2HFY20.For the RBI, domestic growth concerns are likely to override global risk sentiments. Policymakers will tap the available window of sub-target inflation to ease rates by 25 bps on June 6.Statistically, we are likely to have a weak first half and relatively stronger second half. Growth is expected to pick up from the third quarter.The government has a very limited fiscal space. However, current economic conditions call for some stimulus. It will be difficult for the government to adhere to fiscal consolidation path and give stimulus. Any consumption stimulus should not be given, it should be investment stimulus.The RBI is likely to change its stance to accommodative and probability of a 25bp cut in the forthcoming monetary policy is very high.This data is definitely a big negative surprise. Growth is likely to remain weak in the first two quarters of FY20. However, it could pick up in H2FY20. Fiscal pressures are likely to continue in FY20 and hence, the government does not have any headroom for offering stimulus. We expect the final budget to be broadly similar to the interim budget. We do not expect any large-scale stimulus in the budget.""The current level of inflation warrants a rate cut, hence I believe the MPC will deliver a 25 bps cut next weekThis slowdown was quite visible in all leading indicators for the past three months. Going ahead, the new government will first have to address the demand slowdown, which, in turn, requires revitalising the credit channels.On a war footing, they will have to address the issues in basic infrastructure sectors such as power, roads and railways. More than monetary and fiscal stimulus, what is important at this stage is to undertake confidence boosting measures for credit intermediaries and improve the availability of funds for the stuck projects in infrastructure, construction and manufacturing.The onus will be on the newly formed government to give stimulus, to both consumption- and investment-led demand segments. We expect that the government would undertake rationalisation of GST rates and reviving corporate capex through offering tax breaks could help overcome the current slowing economic activity.The GDP print came in worse than our expectations of 6 per cent, while the whole-year print was also lower at 6.8 per cent against CSO's advance estimates.Near-term growth dynamics are unlikely to change dramatically. Factors like lagged impact of tighter financial conditions, sluggish private capex ahead of various domestic election-related and other external uncertainties... will weigh on the growth outlook. We expect only marginal cyclical improvement in growth in FY20 amid easier monetary stance and some consumption-led fiscal push in early FY20.(With inputs from Reuters)"
81,"Study finds unemployment rate at 6.9%, a 2-year high","CHENNAI: Unemployment rate in the country rose to 6.9% in October, the highest in two years, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Worse still, the labour participation rate ‚Äì a measure of the proportion of adults willing to work ‚Äì fell to 42.4%, the lowest since January 2016, CMIE said.‚ÄúLabour participation rate fell sharply after demonetization‚Äù, from around 47-48%, ‚Äúand it has still not recovered,‚Äù the CMIE study said.‚ÄúThe small improvement in labour statistics seen in September turned out to be short-lived. October statistics point to a continuation of the deterioration in labour markets seen earlier,‚Äù the think-tank said.The estimated number of persons employed during October 2018 at 397 million was 2.4% lower than the 407 million persons employed in October 2017. ‚ÄúThis sharp fall in the employment rate in October is perhaps the most worrisome measure of the labour markets.‚Äù CMIE said in its bulletin.The count of the unemployed persons actively looking for jobs almost doubled to 29.5 million in October 2018 from a low of 14 million in July 2017 (and 21.6 millon in Ocotber 2017), CMIE said.Commenting on CMIE's latest unemployment data, Aditya Narayan Mishra, CEO, CIEL HR Services, said, ""October-to-December is traditionally the job creation period across sectors in the Indian economy, and the mismatch between demand and supply of labour is hence worrying."" Annually, almost 12 million people enter the country's labour markets and job creation hasn‚Äôt been robust enough to support this, he said.He added the subdued performance of the country's core sectors such as power and infrastructure , coupled with inadequate lending by NBFCs could be a reason for the mismatch. ""The IT industry has also not created much jobs in this period,"" he said."
82,"Report that says unemployment at 45-year high in 2017-18 not verified, says Niti Aayog","The Niti Aayog on Thursday stepped in to clarify on the survey that claimed India's unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high during 2017-2018, calling it a draft report and that some parts of the jobs data was still being processed.The data is being collected in a new manner. That is the reason why the centre did not release the report, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said at a presser, saying that it was not right to publish the report in an incomplete manner.The Niti panel justifying its action further said that 1-12% nominal economic growth can‚Äôt happen if employment didn‚Äôt grow. The entire data will be shared by March, said the panel.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant recounted the major problems facing our economy. Lack of good quality jobs and a large informal sector is adding to our economic woes stated Kant.The Business Standard report delivered a blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi just months before what is expected to be a closely fought general election.The assessment by the National Sample Survey Office conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate stood at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73, the newspaper reported.The report said that joblessness stood at 7.8 percent in urban areas compared with 5.3 parts in the countryside.The data is significant because this was the first comprehensive assessment of India's employment situation conducted after Modi's decision in November 2016 to withdraw most of the country's banknotes from circulation overnight, the report said.The government declined to confirm or deny the report.""We have not released the report. I do not want to comment on it,"" Pravin Srivastava, India‚Äôs chief statistician told Reuters.The gloomy jobs data could be awkward for Modi's Hindu nationalist government to explain with a general election looming and opinion polls already showing the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party would be unlikely to keep its parliamentary majority.Modi came to power in 2014 promising to galvanise the economy, and boost employment prospects for the millions of young Indians entering the jobs market each year.But, while India's economy has been expanding by 7 percent plus annually -- the fastest pace among major economies -- its uneven growth has meant that there are not enough new jobs to keep pace. And critics say the government's claims of economic success have sounded increasingly hollow.A political controversy over the survey erupted after the acting chairman and another member of the body that reviewed the jobs data resigned saying there was delay in its release.The head of the government-funded National Statistical Commission P.C. Mohanan said on Wednesday that he and colleague J. Meenakshi were unhappy at the non-publication of jobs data that had been due for release in December. He alleged interference by other state agencies over backdated GDP data.A statistics ministry official said the NSSO had submitted the report, but it was up to the government to decide when it should be released.But another senior official, dealing with data, said the government was delaying the release of the survey as the findings were so dismal, and there were plans to incorporate data on persons added in the social security network that could help improve the overall picture.Pronab Sen, former chief statistician of India said unemployment in the India has been rising since 2012 but the attempts to suppress the publication of data was not a solution.""It will only create more suspicion about the intentions of the government,‚Äù he said.The last report published by the statistics ministry had shown that the unemployment rate rose to 5.0 percent in 2015/16 from 4.9 percent in the previous year and 4.0 percent in 2012/13.The unemployment among males stood at 4.3 percent and 8.7 percent among women in 2015/16, the government data showed.Earlier this month, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a leading independent think-tank, said the country lost as many as 11 million jobs last year."
83,"Unemployment to stay at 3.5% in India, but 77% of jobs vulnerable: ILO","NEW DELHI: The International Labour Organisation ( ILO ) has predicted that India‚Äôs unemployment rate in 2018 will stay at 3.5 per cent, while China‚Äôs would edge up from 4.7 per cent to 4.8 per cent. However, a worrying 77 per cent of employment in India would remain ‚Äúvulnerable‚Äù against just 33 per cent in China ‚ÄòThe World Employment and Social Outlook ‚Äì Trends 2018‚Äô released by the ILO states that economic growth in the Asia and the Pacific region is expected to remain buoyant, at around 5.5 per cent over the forecast horizon of two years. India‚Äôs economy, which is anticipated to grow by 7.4 per cent in 2018 (up from 6.7 per cent in 2017) is contributing to the pick up in economic activity in Southern Asia , states the report.Yet, the report notes that ‚Äúwhile there has been strong job creation in some ICT-intensive services, notably in India, a significant portion of the jobs created in the services sector over the past couple of decades have been in traditional low value-added services, where informality and vulnerable forms of employment are often dominant‚Äù.Noting that informality affects around 90 per cent of workers in India, Bangladesh, Cambodia and Nepal, the report says this is only partially driven by the high shares of employment in agriculture. Informality in these countries also remains pervasive in the non-agriculture sectors, such as construction, wholesale and retail trade, and accommodation and food services. In India, the share of informal employment has risen within almost all manufacturing industries, the report observed, attributing it partly to labour market rigidities preventing modern manufacturing from creating employment opportunities.As a result, the vulnerable employment rate in India remains high, but constant at 77 per cent from 2017 to 2019. Vulnerable employment includes the self-employed or those working in family-run establishments. Such people are less likely to have formal work arrangements, and therefore more likely to lack decent working conditions and adequate social security.ILO data shows that of the 1.4 billion people estimated to be in vulnerable employment globally this year, 394 million or more than a quarter will be in India alone.The report states that incidence of working poverty in Asia and the Pacific is expected to continue to decline over the next couple of years. However, the high incidence of informality continues to undermine the prospects of further reducing working poverty, especially in South and South-Eastern Asia."

The 'Young India Ke Bol' campaign was launched to highlight the issue of ""rising unemployment"" in India through a speech competition, said Indian Youth Congress (IYC) media incharge Amrish Ranjan Pandey.

""This initiative is envisioned to give a platform to the young, powerful orators and leaders who can communicate their thoughts to inspire the youth and peers and encourage participatory democracy,"" he said.

The competition is being conducted at district and state level across the country. The national level competition will take place in Delhi on March 23, he said.

""Unemployed students, out of work labourers and distressed farmers have erupted in protests, all over the country, against the government's inability to provide them employment. But, instead of acknowledging their concerns, the government has treated them with complete indifference,"" Pandey charged.

India has become the country with maximum youth population, and the government needs to understand that it cannot run the country by ""suppressing"" their voice, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said. PTI VIT CK"
86,Uttar Pradesh's Unemployment Rate Rises To A Close 10% Mark,"According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, the unemployment rate in the state of Uttar Pradesh doubled in 2019 as compared to the numbers in 2018.

The CMIE numbers showed that the unemployment rate in the most populated state of the country was hovering around 5.91% in 2018 but it grew at 9.95 % in 2019. As per the 2011 census, UP is home to nearly 20 crore people, which is over 16% of India's population.

Relation between the unemployment rate and GDP

As per official data, India's GDP growth stood at 4.5% in the second quarter of 2019. Reportedly, the decline in economic activity has resulted in higher unemployment numbers.

UP's unemployment rate was seen to be higher than that of the national average which grew at 7.7%. The unemployment rate of close to 10% means that nearly 10 in every 100 people are unemployed.

GDP Growth Rate In Q2

India's second-quarter GDP (July-September) growth rate stood at 4.5% -- the slowest growth in almost seven years, as released by Central Statistics Office on Friday.

The previous quarter (April-June) GDP numbers were at 5% and the Q2 (2018-2019) stood at 7%. This development comes in spite of the government's various economic moves like the merger of nine PSU banks into four, major corporate tax cuts, policy changes in the automobile sector, reduction in tax regulations to boost foreign income, attract investors and increase the consumer demand. The government currently follows the base year of 2011-12.

87,"Sharad Yadav Slams Modi Govt Over Unemployment, Economic Slowdown","Former JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav on Thursday criticised the Modi government saying that although the country was facing major issues like unemployment and economic slowdown, the Centre was only talking about Article 370, CAA and uniform civil code. He was talking to reporters on the sidelines of an anti-CAA rally organised by the CPI(M).

""Since the last few months, the government has been only talking about CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), NPR (National Population Register) and NRC (National Register of Citizens), ghar wapsi (home coming), cow and Common Civil Code which in some way resulted in religious conflict between Hindu and Muslims,"" he said.

This is despite the fact that unemployment and economic slowdown are major issues before the country, Yadav added.

""Demonetisation and GST have already broken the back of the people, and now the government is indulging in unconstitutional work by framing laws like CAA,"" he said.

""Although the government is claiming that the country's GDP is 4.5 per cent, it is actually around two per cent only and farmers and youths are facing a lot of hardships,"" he said.

The veteran leader claimed that after the implementation of CAA, NRC and NPR, apart from the rights of Muslims, those of Dalits, tribals and backward class will not remain secure. ""The Constitution is in danger as the government simply indulged in communal politics, spreading falsehood and engineering differences between religions,"" Yadav said. Referring to the Bihar Assembly polls due later this year, he said, ""We will draw our strategy after talks with all our coalition partners."" On who will lead the Bihar polls- Tejashwi Yadav or Prashant Kishore- Yadav said all these are strategic matters and the senior leaders will sit and talk on all these issues."

At a poll rally on Monday, Prime Minister Modi said the protests against the new citizenship law in Shaheen Bagh and other areas here are not a coincidence but an ""experiment"" (""sanyog nahi prayog"") and a political conspiracy to destroy the country's harmony.

Taking on the prime minister, Priyanka Gandhi said a report recently said 3.5 crore jobs have been lost in the last five years in seven important sectors.

""When PM comes to give a speech in front of you, he does not even make a mention of it. Can he tell us whether the job losses was 'sanyog or prayog'. Can he tell us that in 35 years, the unemployment rate is the highest, 'ye kya sanyog tha, ya prayog tha unka'? (Was it coincidence, or his experiment),"" she said at a joint rally with Rahul Gandhi in Sangam Vihar.

The BJP and AAP leaders keep praising themselves but do not talk about the things that matter to the people, she said.

Attacking Modi, Priyanka Gandhi said the prime minister says that the opposition does not allow him to work, but he is still working at a fast pace.

""This is true that state firms are being sold at a fast pace. They sold LIC, BPCL, Air India, BSNL and our even planning to sell railways. Really his pace is really fast. The Congress government alleviated 14 crore people out of poverty and in five years they have rapidly pushed people back in poverty,"" the Congress leader alleged.

She also attacked Union Home Minister Amit Shah over his remarks that ""we (the BJP) will make Delhi like UP"".

""I am the Congress general secretary of UP, let me tell you what he has made of UP. It was a state that had the most potential. What is the state of affairs now, the BJP government, has harassed people,"" she alleged.

""Unemployment rate in UP is the highest, every two minutes a woman is raped, every 90 minutes there is a crime against a child, everyday there is an atrocity against 30 Dalits, maximum number of murders are in UP, unemployment is on top while eduction is languishing at the bottom of priorities,"" Priynaka Gandhi said.

""This is the state of affairs in UP where they have a government and they say that they want to make Delhi like UP. There is crime, anarchy and no sign of development in UP,"" she said.

Priyanka Gandhi also slammed Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, saying it is claiming credit for work done by former Delhi chief minister Sheila Dikshit.

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi invests Rs 5,200 crore in publicity, Arvind Kejriwal is not far behind and has spent Rs 611 crore for the Delhi polls,"" she said.

""What is the need for publicity if work is doing the talking for them,"" Priyanka Gandhi said, adding that they are doing so because they have done less work.

The BJP and the AAP should say how many roads and flyovers they have constructed, she said.

""Real issues are not being raised, someone talks of other countries, someone talks of divisive issues. One says those speaking against him is anti-national. When somebody raises people's issues, efforts are made to shut him up,"" she added.

Hitting out at the previous UPA government over spreading lies against against the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government at Centre alleging that 'there is no employment', PM Modi set the record straight saying that while there were only 1.5 crore jobs in UPA government, there were massive 6 crore on-record jobs during Atalji's government.

""This is their (UPA) government tradition. I am trying to make new institutions so that there is a perfect system. But, do you remember during Atal Bihari Vajpayee's government? They went around beating the drum on the same issue. During Atalji's tenure, they continuously said 'there is no employment.' After Atalji's tenure, there were statistics that proved that there were 6 crore jobs in Atalji's tenure. And during UPA there were only 1.5 crore jobs and yet they maligned Atalji's government. The Lutyens ecosystem kept beating the drums. Imagine, 4 crore people, it's a total of 15 to 17 crore - exact number will be here or there - who have taken money from banks via the mudra scheme. 4 crore people have taken money for the first time. They must have started some employment, they must have employed somebody,"" PM Modi said.

In an array of questions, PM Modi further shuts down the Opposition on their allegations on employment generation during NDA government."

They say, even bring the Muslims. How do we get them? I had said, we have a population of 156 crore people, we still can't disciple that. What is wrong with CAA? Now the issue is NRC.

The unemployment, according to the report, was higher in urban areas with 7.8 percent as compared to 5.3 percent in rural areas of the country.

Mohanan told NDTV that he had quit over ‚Äòdisagreements‚Äô with the government on the release of a jobs survey and concerns about it being buried in election season. With their departure the body is left with just Chief Statistician Pravin Srivastava and plan body NITI Aayog‚Äôs Amitabh Kant.

The revelation on unemployment rate will be extremely bad news for the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. In 2014, Modi had promised to create 2 crore jobs every year."
115,Chinese media has some advice for India to avert its unemployment,"India should shift focus to low-end manufacturing like China to take full advantage of its demographic dividend to avert an unemployment crisis, a state run Chinese daily said.

‚ÄúChina lifted millions of people out of poverty in the last three decades by focusing on developing its own manufacturing industry‚Äù, an article in the state-run Global Times said.

India should shift focus to low-end manufacturing like China to take full advantage of its demographic dividend to avert an unemployment crisis, a state run Chinese daily said.

‚ÄúChina lifted millions of people out of poverty in the last three decades by focusing on developing its own manufacturing industry‚Äù, an article in the state-run Global Times said.

‚ÄúWhether India‚Äôs fast pace of growth can persist depends on how quickly it realises that the feasible route to inclusive growth is not by skipping past industrialisation but by relying on the manufacturing industry to create more jobs, reduce poverty and create a middle class that can drive consumption,‚Äù it said.

India should be realistic in addressing its employment issue and focus more on developing its low-end industries to create more jobs.

‚ÄúSuch urgency has been raised because there is scepticism about whether India can efficiently utilise its demographic dividend ‚Äì the country is set to have the world‚Äôs largest working-age population by 2020,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúGiven the fact that India will soon or later have the world‚Äôs largest working population ‚Äì people aged 15 to 64 years ‚Äì this observation doesn‚Äôt seem like an exaggeration,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúThere has long been a myth in India that the world‚Äôs fastest growing economy could skip being a manufacturing base and move directly into a sustainable growth model relying on services‚Äù.

There have even been calls for renewed focus on the services sector in India after a report released earlier this year suggested that the services sector contributed more than 60% to GDP in the 2015-16 financial year.

But this conception should be considered wrong and dangerous, it said.

‚ÄúNot only does this argument push back against the ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù initiative launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2014 ‚Äì which aims to transform India into a manufacturing powerhouse ‚Äì but it also, in practice, may lead India into a trap where its huge population dividend cannot materialise,‚Äù it said.

Citing research reports it said the services sector absorbs only about a quarter of the labour force in India despite the fact that it accounts for more than half of GDP.

‚ÄúOn the other hand, manufacturing accounts for about 15% of the country‚Äôs GDP and employs 11% of the labour force, a job absorptive capacity that is greater than the services sector,‚Äù it said.

‚ÄúFor the sake of creating more jobs to accommodate the growing working population, India should not neglect the manufacturing sector, especially low-end labor-intensive industries. This could also help absorb a large number of workers who are employed in unorganised sectors,‚Äù it said.

This was after a US think-tank said that Donald Trump‚Äôs restrictive policies on immigration have led to the denials of applications for H1-B Visas by Indians.

Taking to Twitter, Priyanka wrote in Hindi, ‚ÄúEveryone should ask the BJP government as to who‚Äôs being helped under its regime. Prime Minister travelled to America for his own ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô but America increased the number of rejections the H1-B Visas for Indians, willing to work there.‚Äù

PM Modi had travelled to the US to attend his much-publicised ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô event in September this year. The event was billed as Modi‚Äôs success to build a new friendly relationship with the US administration headed by President Donald Trump. Modi‚Äôs ‚ÄòAbki Baar Trump Sarkar‚Äô at the ‚ÄòHowdy, Modi‚Äô event in the presence of the US President had triggered a huge controversy.

A report by news agency PTI said that the denial rate of H-1B petitions for initial employment for Amazon, Microsoft, Intel and Google in 2015 was just 1%. In 2019, the same increased respectively to 6, 8, 7 and 3%. The denial rate for Apple remained the same at 2%.

During the same period, the denial rate jumped from 4% to 41% for Tech Mahindra, from 6% to 34% for Tata Consultancy Services, from 7% to 53% for Wipro and from just 2% to 45% for Infosys."
118,"Union Minister Santosh Gangwar blames lack of skills among north Indians for growing joblessness, later issues clarification after condemnation","Union Minister Santosh Gangwar has blamed the lack of skills among north Indians for the growing joblessness. Faced with considerable condemnation, Gangwar, who holds the portfolio of Ministry of State for Labour and Employment in the central government, said that he was referring to his ministry‚Äôs plans to provide skills among the country‚Äôs youth.



Speaking to reporters, Gangwar had said, ‚ÄúI want to say that there is no dearth of job opportunities in the country. Those who come for recruitment in north India often complain that they are not able to find quality candidates required for the post they are hiring for.‚Äù

#WATCH MoS Labour & Employment, Santosh K Gangwar says, ‚ÄúDesh mein rozgaar ki kami nahi hai. Humare Uttar Bharat mein jo recruitment karne aate hain is baat ka sawaal karte hain ki jis padd (position) ke liye hum rakh rahe hain uski quality ka vyakti humein kum milta hai.‚Äù (14/9) pic.twitter.com/qQtEQA89zg ‚Äî ANI (@ANI) September 15, 2019

Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra took to Twitter to launch a tirade against the minister accusing him of insulting north Indians. She wrote, ‚ÄúMr Minister, you‚Äôve been in the government for more than five years. You failed to create jobs. The existing jobs disappeared due to economic slowdown. Youths are looking up to the government with a hope that it will do something better for them. But you are trying to escape by insulting north Indians. This won‚Äôt happen.‚Äù

Gangwar later issued a clarification that his intention was not to insult north Indians. The minister, according to ANI, said, ‚ÄúWhat I said had a different context that there was lack of skills&govt has opened skill ministry so children can be trained as per job requirement.‚Äù

This is not the first time that a union minister has made bizarre comments to justify their poor governance on managing the country‚Äôs economy. Earlier Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman blamed the Uber and Ola taxi services to justify the slowdown in the automobile sector. Days later, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal had faced social media roasting for crediting Albert Einstein with the discovery of gravity while justifying the economic slowdown."
119,Secularism in danger! Solutions for Indian minorities,"‚ÄúFascism is not itself a new order. It is the future refusing to be born.‚Äù

That was a famous quote by Aneurin Bevan and it characterises the rise of Islamo-fascism in the form of ISIS, the far right in Europe and USA and Hindutva brand of nationalism in India.

Soon after winning the 2019 Indian parliamentary elections, the prime minister of India made a victory speech to his cadres where he mocked opposition parties for espousing secularism. He seemed convinced that his communally infused campaign had got a thumbs up from the Indian electorate after a convincing victory. His speech was a culmination of a string of dog whistles and actions by his supporters and party leaders during his tenure as prime minister.

Modi‚Äôs first term as India‚Äôs prime minister saw; Anti minority antagonistic speeches gaining normalcy, the othering of Muslims and Christians, cultural genocide against Muslims by using state machinery by changing the names of Mughalsarai to Pandit Deendayal Upaddhyay station, Allahabad to Prayagraj and Faizabad to Ayodhya. Add to that killings of dozens of innocent Muslims in the guise of respecting cows, frequent attacks on Christian churches and churchgoers, appointment of extremist Hindu political leaders and known hate-mongers to positions of power, coercive ‚ÄòGhar Wapasi programmes‚Äô designed to reconvert Christians and Muslims and attempts to create an atmosphere of fear and insecurity amongst minorities.

Modi‚Äôs landslide victory in the last month‚Äôs parliamentary polls has forced Indian minorities to seriously examine their future course of action for their survival in India. Chatters from minorities over ‚ÄòWhat do we do now?‚Äô are gaining momentum with some affluent minorities even contemplating leaving India.

Two-pronged solution

I would propose two courses of action for the Minorities. The first and morally right thing to do is join forces with secular-minded groups like the Samajwadi Party, the Trinamool, the DMK, the Communist parties, the RJD, and a reformed Congress party and fight to keep India a secular State. However with a sweeping mandate for the BJP despite unemployment touching a 45-year high and economic growth slowing down considerably, it‚Äôs quite clear that the BJP has successfully managed to communally hack the minds of the Hindu majority in India.

The saffron party under Modi and BJP President Amit Shah have also succeeded in communalising some government and constitutional institutions. There is a certain mass hysteria that seems to have been generated around Narendra Modi as a cult figure with his agenda of ultra-nationalism and his brand of Hindutva. Even a tweet by the BJP leader and ex-cricketer Gautam Gambhir upholding secularism was criticised by his right-wing friends including actor Anupam Kher. I am surprised he was not mocked as ‚Äòsickular‚Äô( a slur used against secular individuals).

The second and complimentary course of action for Indian minorities in times to come would be to politically mobilise themselves on religious grounds under one umbrella and seek economic rights, political representation and quotas in government and other institutions along with advocating for other fundamental rights for minorities. Currently, Muslims form nearly 15% (according to the government data) of the Indian population but they have only 27 MPs representing them which is only 5% of the total number of MPs in the parliament.

As the BJP openly declares itself as a party that wants to promote Hindutva and Hindu interests and we have SAD ( Shiromani Akali Dal) promoting the interests for Sikhs, it is only logical and fair to state that we need parties to represent other religious minority groups such as Muslims and Christians since they have relied on the currently dysfunctional and poorly-led Congress party that itself has embarked on the agenda of soft Hindutva.

Sincere and capable individuals and groups must come forward to form and lead new political movements based on religious or pseudo-religious grounds to represent the interests of Muslims, Christians and other minority groups respectively. Each new political party should avoid spreading their theology or religion rather it should be a force for advancing the economic, social and cultural rights and progress of its respective community.

I must also state that the leadership and members of these political parties must not aspire for personal glory, shun corrupt despotic behaviour, not allow the development of personality cults and avoid verbal belligerence and the use of physical violence. The leaders don‚Äôt have to be highly educated doctors, engineers or scholars rather they have to be decent human beings who have their communities interests at heart and are able to effectively represent those interests.

But we have Owaisi, Muslim League

One might argue that the Muslims already have a party based on religious grounds such as the Muslim league and the AIMIM. Personally, I‚Äôve been unimpressed with the leadership of the AIMIM as they had supported regressive ideas like Triple Talaq and are too antagonistic in their approach. The Muslim League does not seem to have the pan-India reach and influence like the BJP.

The political parties I am suggesting should preferably be borne out of a moderate progressive Islamic and Christian ideology and should have a non-political ideological mentor. Ennahda in Tunisia is a good case study of a political party that is inspired by progressive Islam while being committed to the separation of State from Religion. The political models I am proposing for religious minorities are used in countries like Iran and Lebanon and for ethnic minorities in Germany and Romania.

I must emphatically say that I aspire for a society where political parties are not based on religion.In an ideal world I am strongly opposed to mobilising political movements on religious grounds, however we can all see the BJP and its leaders openly or covertly canvassing for elections by invoking Hindu culture and declaring Islam and Christianity non-Indian faiths and so ground realities have forced me to take a practical approach to protecting minorities. The equations are simple. Hindus and compliant minorities who accept hegemonic Hinduism have the BJP to represent their interests while Muslims and Christians lack that kind of effective representation leading to their disenfranchisement. Muslims and Christians are as much a part of the Indian social fabric as any other community and against the current onslaught have to vigorously protect their communities interests and advocate for the preservation of their culture by campaigning against actions like changing the names of cities and places. In a future Hindu State or an India that is secular just on paper as is the case now by what the country‚Äôs majority has chosen by giving Narendra Modi a bigger majority, Muslims, Christians and other minorities have to mobilise themselves to chart a new course for their respective religious groups.

120,"Government releases scary data on economic growth, unemployment days after Lok Sabha elections","The official data released by the Central Statistics Office on Friday revealed how India‚Äôs economic growth had slowed to a five-year low between January and March this year. The contributing factor for this slow growth was said to be the poor performance in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors.

The CSO data also revealed that the GDP growth during 2018-19 fiscal year had consistently experienced a downward trend clocking an average of 6.8 percent, lower than 7.2 per cent in the previous financial year.

‚ÄúGDP (gross domestic product) at constant (2011-12) prices in Q4 of 2018-19 is estimated at Rs 37.20 lakh crore, as against Rs 35.15 lakh crore in Q4 of 2017-18, showing a growth rate of 5.8 per cent,‚Äù news agency IANS quoted the CSO data.

Meanwhile, the statistics ministry also confirmed an earlier report that India‚Äôs unemployment rate was at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. This came as a sharp contradiction with its own stand before the Lok Sabha polls when a newspaper in January reported the unemployment was the highest for 45 years.

The news evoked criticism from the critics of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who took a swipe at the central government for its questionable five-year rule at the Centre. AIMIM President Asaduddin Owaisi wrote on Twitter, ‚ÄúModi can‚Äôt even better his own mediocre record. Record unemployment? Lowest GDP? Modi hai to mumkin hai Of course his core voter won‚Äôt complain. He‚Äôs awake only when Gau lynching falls below 5% or when young Dalits ride a horse in their wedding baaraat.‚Äù

Modi can‚Äôt even better his own mediocre record. Record unemployment? Lowest GDP? Modi hai to mumkin hai Of course his core voter won‚Äôt complain.

The previous low was at 6.4 percent in 2013-2014. India‚Äôs economy grew only by 5.8 percent during the fourth quarter of 2018-19, which is significantly below China‚Äôs 6.4 percent.

With this gloomy revelation, India also lost the tag of the fastest growing economy in the world."
121,"Frustrated by unemployment, Goa‚Äôs youth whose parents were born before 1961 are obtaining Portuguese citizenship","Goa unit of Congress party on Monday launched a tirade against the government led by the BJP on the increasing unemployment in the western coastal Indian state.

Speaking in the state assembly, Congress MLA Francis Silveira said that the growing unemployment and the government‚Äôs inability to provide jobs, youth in the state were now migrating abroad with the ‚Äòhelp of Portuguese passport.‚Äô

His attack came amidst growing concern that ‚Äòoutsiders‚Äô were slowly taking over the employment while leaving the local population high and dry. Locals are disenchanted with political parties such as Goa Forward Party, which won the 2017 elections promising to put the Goans‚Äô interests first.

According to an IANS report, MLA Silveira told the state assembly that due to lack of jobs in Goa, young talents from his constituency in St. Andre were turning to Portugal.

Taking part in a debate on labour and employment, Silveira said, ‚ÄúThey say there are no jobs in Goa and are migrating by taking the Portuguese passport.‚Äù

Under the Portuguese immigration laws, residents of Goa are entitled to obtain Portuguese passports if their parents and grandparents were born in Goa, when it was under the control of Portugal. Once armed with Portuguese passport, an individual can work anywhere in Europe including the UK until Brexit deal does not come in force.

They do not need to obtain any work permit as would be the case for non-EU nationals such as those from rest of India. A report quoted by IANS said that over the last ten years, more than 1,200 natives of St. Andre constituency had opted for the Portuguese passport and nationality.

Goa was freed from Portuguese rule on 19 December 1961, after the state remained under Portuguese control for m ore four centuries. In 1961, the Indian army was forced to intervene in the wake of firing from the Portuguese that killed one fisherman.

But even after the independence and its accession to India, Goa continues to follows its own civil laws.

122,What exactly are Modi government celebrating and at who's expense?,"The day Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced demonetisation, he had promised that the radical move would ensure the eradication of black money, end terrorism and counterfeit currency. The country was thrown into utter chaos following demonetisation announcement that caused nearly 200 deaths, never ending queues outside ATMs and banks, confusion within the RBI and the banks with both behaving like headless chickens on how to handle the shortage of cash.

However, the country cooperated with the government and the PM in the hope that demonetisation may be a good step for India‚Äôs overall economy and the pain will be well worth it. The ensuing months showed just how hollow the promises turned out to be.

The country today still doesn‚Äôt know how much black money was unearthed, how Jammu and Kashmir and states affected by Maoist insurgency continue to see horrors of terrorism and how much the issue of the counterfeit currency has been addressed.

What is known is that the demon of demonetisation crippled the informal economy and the manufacturing hubs across the country. The fall in manufacturing is also shown in the GDP data.

Dr Manmohan Singh in his speech in Rajya Sabha had said that the way this scheme was implemented made it not just a monumental management failure but also a case of organised loot and legalised plunder.

Besides Dr Singh, many other economists too questioned the need for taking a step as drastic as demonetisation with almost all predicting considerable decline in growth. They weren‚Äôt far from the truth as the fourth quarter GDP figures now show.

The government kept mocking all those who questioned demonetisation move and predicted economic disaster. The electoral victory achieved through social engineering in Uttar Pradesh was touted as the endorsement for note ban from the people.

The numbers however don‚Äôt lie.

Though most economists have questioned the new methodology to calculate the GDP that transformed India‚Äôs economy into the best in the world in terms of growth. The new methodology gave the government the bragging rights as the fastest growing economy. India has, unfortunately, lost that bragging right too as China has now taken the lead with their GDP growing at 6.9 percent in the same quarter.

This disappointing fourth quarter GDP at 6.1% comes despite changing the the IIP and WPI to 2011-12 base, which was largely believed would give a boost to GDP data for fourth quarter. What is equally disappointing is that the GVA growth that in the Jan-Mar 2016 period was at 8.7% fell to 5.6% in Jan-Mar 2017 period.

The GDP data, should work as a reminder to the people of the country that Narendra Modi government has failed to deliver its 2014 campaign promises. The government‚Äôs vision-less policies have resulted in the country‚Äôs inability to revive investment, boost bank credit growth or create jobs.

The GDP data aside, the celebrations and false chest-thumping around Modi completing three years in office also remind me of the claims on new jobs creation the prime minister made while campaigning during the Lok Sabha elections in 2013. While addressing a rally in Agra, Modi had famously claimed that his party will create 1 crore new jobs after it comes to power.

Three years into the government, there‚Äôs no trace of new jobs with unemployment rate going in upward direction.

The government‚Äôs own data, as reported by IANS, says that the unemployment rate in 2015-16 was 5% of the labour force, up from 4.9% in 2013-14, when the Congress-led UPA governed the country.

India‚Äôs private sector too paints an incredibly gloomy picture with the IBM joining the list of big IT firms now forced to lay off thousands of staff. IBM is expected to let go at least 5,000 staff after Infosys, Wipro and Cognizant made similar moves owing to downbeat economic scenario.

The district-wise celebration planned at completion of their three years at the Centre is yet another publicity drive at the expense of PSUs of the country. The numbers that show unemployment growing and GDP slowing is a damning indictment of the government‚Äôs failed economics. I wonder what exactly they are celebrating and at who‚Äôs expense!

123,"Despite demonetisation, consumer sentiment Up, unemployment rate down: Survey","Contrary to popular perception, the overall consumer sentiment rose over 210 bps to 98.75 from 96.65, while the unemployment rate fell by nearly 150 bps to 6.10 per cent during the week demonetisation was announced, according to the data by the BSE and Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).

‚ÄúConsumer sentiment shot up during the week of the demonetisation announcement. In a quantitative way, independent of alignment to any political party, the sentiment was good. The next week it fell a shade, though. But we don‚Äôt know what the sentiment will be later,‚Äù CMIE managing director and chief executive, Mahesh Vyas said at a BSE seminar here today.

The survey was based on a sample size of around 10,000 households, he said.

This is despite the fact the agency claiming that demonetisation has disrupted consumption which will in turn lead to postponement in investment revival.

‚ÄúDemonetisation was a big shock and I thought data will tell that the public don‚Äôt like it but when the data came in, they said they like it‚Ä¶There is a need for us to look at this jump compared to other jumps,‚Äù he said, adding they will keenly monitor the consumer responses on big ticket consumer durable goods.

However, the week after the announcement, the sentiment slipped slightly to around 98.60 while the unemployment rate inched by nearly 40 bps to 6.5 per cent, he said.

Mr Vyas, however, was quick to add that ‚Äúthe problem is we have disrupted consumption and while disrupting consumption, we have done something more, which we have postponed quite substantially a revival in investments. We were waiting for demand to pick up so that investment picks up. Now we will have to wait.‚Äù

Overall unemployment rate in the country was at 9.19 per cent during May-August period, with the urban unemployment at 10.77 per cent, and the rural at 8.38 per cent. The consumer sentiment as end August was 101.54, from 100.1 on May 1, this year.

CMIE observed that the consumer sentiment is inversely proportionate to household income, with the sentiment among the rich households measuring 122.36 during May to August, while among the poor households it was 91.55.

Rural India recorded better consumer sentiment with 100.91 compared to urban which reported 96.35.

The CMIE data for the January-August period revealed that consumer expectations were higher than current economic conditions, indicating that they believed in better prospects for future.

124,"Indian IT industry trembles as Trump pledges to protect borders from oustiders ‚Äòstealing‚Äô, ‚Äòdestroying‚Äô jobs","New US President Donald Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòBuy American-hire American‚Äô rallying cry has put the $150- billion Indian IT industry on edge, which is in wait-and-watch mode to see how the new administration evolves policies around outsourcing and movement of skilled workers. India hopes to have a meaningful engagement with the US, Electronics and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said.

Given that US market accounts for 60% of India‚Äôs IT exports, the industry and the government in New Delhi will spare no efforts in their outreach programme over the next few weeks to showcase the role of Indian technology sector in making the US economy more competitive and highlight its contribution in terms of billions of dollars paid in taxes and creation of local jobs. ‚ÄúIndian IT companies are in 200 cities across 80 countries. They have added big value to the US, and given jobs to lakhs of people including American people there. I am given to understand that they have paid billions of dollars in tax‚Ä¶ So they have added value to America in terms of money, by way of tax and also employment,‚Äù Prasad told PTI in an interview just hours before Trump was sworn in as the 45th US President.

Stating that India wishes to have a meaningful engagement with the Trump government, Prasad said ‚ÄúWe will await unfolding of his views about Indian IT companies‚Äô outreach. We have already conveyed our views to them and we will continue (to do so).‚Äù Nasscom President R Chandrashekhar said Trump has been pro-India and understands business realities being a businessman himself. The adverse impact on job creation within the US on account of any restriction put has to be weighed very carefully (by the new administration), he cautioned. Communication and outreach will, therefore, be more critical, he said, adding that Nasscom is planning a visit to Washington in February to meet senior representatives of the US administration and the Congress. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄòAmerica First‚Äô pledge, which formed the essence of his inaugural speech last Friday, has reinforced worries of protectionist posturing and unnerved the Indian IT industry which, as it is, has been battling headwinds of a slowing growth. Trump has vowed to rebuild the country using ‚ÄúAmerican hands‚Äù and his inaugural was punctuated with lines like Buy American and Hire American.

‚ÄúWe must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength,‚Äù Trump said. Trump‚Äôs hardline stance on protectionism and anti-immigration is no surprise to the Indian industry. While companies have tried putting on a brave face, concerns run deep about tightening of visa norms that will push up the cost of doing business. Earlier this month, a Bill targeting H-1B visas was reintroduced in the US Congress by two lawmakers who said it will help crack down on the work visa abuse. Any restriction placed by the US on outsourcing or movement of skilled workers will have far-reaching consequences for Indian firms like TCS, Infosys and Wipro. Already, companies have been preparing to mitigate the impact and have ramped up local hiring even if it means eating into their margins.

Hoping for a ‚Äúbusiness-friendly administration‚Äù, Infosys chief Vishal Sikka said Trump himself is an entrepreneur and a business leader and therefore, he expects that this will be the case of business and innovation-friendly regime. ‚ÄúIn the near term, we do expect there will be changes to the visa and H1-B visa policies. As policies take effect, we will consider, analyse and understand their impact,‚Äù he said. The larger rival, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), has also said it is proactively addressing these concerns by making changes to its business model. Greyhound Research Chief Analyst and CEO Sanchit Gogia said better skilled jobs, including coding and maintenance, are likely to remain unaffected, given their scarce availability and exclusivity.

125,Nearly 69 percent of jobs in India threatened by automation: World Bank,"Automation threatens 69 per cent of the jobs in India, while 77 per cent in China, according to a World Bank research which has said that technology could fundamentally disrupt the pattern of traditional economic path in developing countries. ‚ÄúAs we continue to encourage more investment in infrastructure to promote growth, we also have to think about the kinds of infrastructure that countries will need in the economy of the future. We all know that technology has and will continue to fundamentally reshape the world,‚Äù World Bank President Jim Kim said.

‚ÄúBut the traditional economic path from increasing productivity of agriculture to light manufacturing and then to full-scale industrialisation may not be possible for all developing countries,‚Äù Kim said in response to a question at the Brookings Institute during a discussion on extreme poverty Tuesday.

‚ÄúIn large parts of Africa, it is likely that technology could fundamentally disrupt this pattern. Research based on World Bank data has predicted that the proportion of jobs threatened in India by automation is 69 per cent, in China it is 77 per cent and in Ethiopia, the percentage of jobs threatened by automation is 85 per cent,‚Äù he said.

‚ÄúNow, if this is true, and if these countries are going to lose these many jobs, we then have to understand what paths to economic growth will be available for these countries and then adapt our approach to infrastructure accordingly,‚Äù Kim said.

He said one child policy could have been reason of sharp decline in child stunting and malnutrition, which is now at 10 per cent.

‚ÄúThe one child policy could have been part of it, but anyway the point is, that if you look at educational outcomes and things like child stunting, India is at 38.7 per cent child stunting, they are literally walking into the future with 40 per cent of their workforce probably being unable to compete in the global digital economy, whereas China over the years has brought it down very, very low,‚Äù Kim said.

‚ÄúIn India, it is probably partly because of sanitation that children are often in a just constant diarrheal stage, because of open defecation. There is a lot of different pieces of it. But I have been saying to the leaders of these countries that have these high stunting rates, there is like an emergency for you, you have got to tackle it,‚Äù Kim said.

127,"Over 50% Saudi jobs meant for Indians shifted to Bangladesh, Pakistan in Modi govt","New Delhi: When Narendra Modi made his maiden visit to Saudi Arabia last year, it was widely hailed as another masterstroke by the Indian prime minister with commentators dubbing his act as ‚ÄòModi scoring big with befriending Saudi.‚Äù

Modi‚Äôs supporters in media and outside argued that by befriending Saudi, Modi had effectively neutralised the influence of India‚Äôs arch-rival, Pakistan. However, the latest data shows that 50% Saudi jobs meant for Indians shifted to Pakistan and Bangladesh under Modi as India‚Äôs prime minister.

The Narendra Modi government had come to power on the promise of creating two crore jobs early but half of its tenure has passed and the unemployment rate is continuously increasing. This has been admitted in the Rajya Sabha by Minister of State for Planning Rao Inderjit Singh.

Backwards are the largest sufferers. In reply to a question during Question Hour, Singh had said that overall unemployment was rising, but the rate was highest among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs).

Ironically, the government not only failed in creating jobs back at home but it indirectly shifted more than 50% gulf jobs meant for Indian workers to Pakistan and Bangladesh.

The complication of newly introduced eMigration system caused havoc and Saudi employers in turn started shifting the job opportunities towards neighbouring Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The unnecessary formalities in visa possessing created utmost delay in e-migration clearance for non-skilled and semi-skilled workers who go to gulf countries in search of jobs.

The government data shows that there are more than 50% decrease in number of migrant workers who go to Saudi Arabia for jobs since the Modi government came to power.

In 2013, there were 3,53,565 Indians who went on job visa to Saudi Arabia while in 2016 only 65,356 could go there for jobs.

In 2013, there were only 12,654 Bangladeshis who got employment in the Gulg country but in 2016 their number rose to 1,43,913. While in 2013 the number of Pakistanis who got employment in Saudi Arabia were 6,36,721, this number increased to 7,71,867 in 2016.

It is to be noted that the Ministry of Overseas Indian Affairs (MOIA), the Government of India, rolled out its eMigration Project to all the POE offices perhaps without taking its adverse fallouts and implications into consideration.

As a result, over half a million job opportunities from India have already been lost to other neighboring nations like Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka where there is no such complicated formalities like eMigrate System or Minimum Referral Wages.

Furthermore, if this policy does not change, there are fears that India will lose to the tune of $30 billion annually in the form of foreign remittance which is one of the major sources of strengthening our vibrating economy.

India gets the highest amount of remittances in the world at roughly $70 billion, almost three times the amount of FDI that comes into the country.

By far, the largest amount comes from the Gulf countries ‚Äì Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait ‚Äì which sent a combined $32.7 billion, almost half of all remittances received. Below is the foreign remittances data as compiled by the World Bank.

It resulted into steep decline in remittances from Saudi Arabia which is the largest employer of Indian workers.

During his UAE visit in August 2015, PM Modi had promised to the Gulf employers that the complicacy of eMigration system will be resolved in 30 days, but that is yet to happen.

This was less than 5.8% quarterly growth registered in the last quarter of the previous financial year and 8% that the Indian economy registered in the first quarter of the last financial year.

The latest revelation has officially confirmed that the country‚Äôs economy was facing its worst and most prolonged slowdown in six years. The economic growth for the quarter ending March 2013 had stood at 4.3%.

The latest revelation on the GDP is lower than even the forecast made by a group of economists, who had predicted the country‚Äôs GDP to grow by 5.7%.

One of the reasons behind the huge slump in the economy is the weak consumer demand and dip in private investments. Meanwhile, India Ratings and Research (Fitch Group) has revised India‚Äôs FY20 gross domestic product (GDP) growth downwards to 6.7% from its earlier forecast of 7.3%.

Only a week ago, according to PTI, Moody‚Äôs Investors Service had cut India‚Äôs GDP growth forecast for 2019 calendar year to 6.2% from the previous estimation of 6.8%. For 2020 calendar year, it reduced the estimate by a similar measure to 6.7%.

KV Subramanian, whose Twitter bio describes him as Chief Economic Advisor, wrote, ‚ÄúGDP estimates show that India‚Äôs GDP growth, while high, has shown some slowdown. This is due to both endogenous and exogenous factors. Impact comes, especially, from global headwinds due to deceleration in developed economies, Sino-American trade conflict etc.‚Äù

The government has, so far, been in a denial mode rejecting any suggestions of a slowdown in the economy. The latest revelation on the GDP must worry the government."
130,"‚ÄòAt current pace, BJP govt will take 1,560 yrs to create jobs‚Äô","The Congress today hit out at the BJP-led NDA government at the Centre, on its third anniversary, accusing it of having failed on all fronts including jobs creation.

‚ÄúThe BJP government has failed on all fronts. Their tall promise of creating two crore jobs annually too has fallen flat. Every month 10 lakh youth get added to the queue of the unemployed.

‚ÄúIndia needs to create 34.35 crore jobs by 2028, that is 3-4 crore jobs every year. At current speed, the government will take 1,560 years to create as many jobs,‚Äù Congress general secretary and former Union minister, C P Joshi said at a press conference where Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar was also present.

Joshi, who is also a party spokesperson, alleged that the BJP only believed in propaganda, politics of polarisation, false promises and misleading the public.

‚ÄúYesterday, former PM Manmohan Singh had said that the country‚Äôs growth has slowed down mainly due to demonetisation.

Maximum impact has been seen on the informal sector, the government should tell how many jobs have been lost in this sector,‚Äù he said.

Asked about the BJP‚Äôs argument that they have not been hit by any scam, unlike the previous Congress led UPA government, Joshi said, ‚Äúyou wait for some time, many things will come out of the closet.‚Äù

He said the Congress will collect proof on how corruption was going on and then bring it before the people.

‚ÄúCongress is a responsible party, we do not want to mislead people‚Ä¶.We also want to ask why no action is being taken against some big companies, who owe banks a whopping Rs 1.25 lakh crore,‚Äù he said.

Joshi said the BJP led government had collected Rs 1,32,649 crore as ‚Äúeducation cess‚Äù in the last three years and said that ‚Äúno one knows where the money has gone?‚Äù

He said that according to a report, as many as 4.7 crore school children drop out every year and government schools have vacancies of over 5 lakh teachers.

Joshi said that Aadhaar has been made compulsory for the ‚Äòmid day meal‚Äô scheme which may deprive many children from getting these meals.

‚ÄúThe UGC budget has been cut by 55 per cent from Rs 9,315 crore in 2015-16 to Rs 4,286 crore in 2016-17. Autonomy of universities has been compromised. Gag orders, slew of bans and harassment of girls have stifled opinions and discussions in several institutes of higher learning,‚Äù he alleged.

On MGNREGA, he said, the government had increased the wages by a paltry average of just 2.7 per cent in 2017-18.

‚ÄúA cruel joke is that in BJP ruled states like Assam, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh and Utarakhand, the increase in daily wages under MGNREGA is an abysmal Re 1 in 2017-18,‚Äù he alleged.

‚ÄúOn one hand, BJP makes Aadhaar card compulsory for MGNREGA but only 15 per cent registered workers are linked to Aadhaar based payments uptill December 2016. This will deny work and kill the MGNREGA,‚Äù he said.

He also claimed the ‚Äòstartup‚Äô campaign India was a ‚Äúnon- starter‚Äù.

Joshi also quoted National Crime Record Bureau figures, saying they showed that kidnapping of women, human trafficking and crimes against children have witnessed a surge.

‚ÄúDelhi and BJP ruled states like Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have the highest crime rate,‚Äù he said.

On the Centre‚Äôs flagship ‚ÄòBeti Bachao-Beti Padhao‚Äô campaign, he said, it was a ‚Äústill-born‚Äù idea centred around fanfare, sloganeering and an ad blitz.

He said that Rs 1,000 crore of ‚ÄúNirbhaya Fund‚Äù for women‚Äôs safety and dignity had not been utilised.

Referring to the Haryana government‚Äôs move to have a criteria of minimum qualification for those contesting Panchayat elections, Joshi said the BJP governments in Rajasthan and Haryana had disenfranchised 75 per cent women by mandating educational qualification.

‚ÄúWomen in Assam are now being punished for having more than two children by denying them the right to get elected,‚Äù he said.

He also alleged that fear psychosis was being created amongst the minorities of the country.

‚ÄúBJP is attacking minorities as a tool of their polarising agenda,‚Äù he alleged. He also claimed that atrocities on the Dalits had increased ever since the BJP came to power.

‚ÄúAlso, recruitment in central government jobs for scheduled castes has declined by 91 per cent during the BJP rule,‚Äù he claimed."
131,"Union minister concedes, says current growth not translating into more jobs","Conceding that growth of the economy was not translating into more employment, Union Minister Bandaru Dattatreya today said a task force has been set up to compile figures of jobs generated in the last three years.

‚ÄúThe current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it‚Ä¶ growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,‚Äù he told reporters here.

A jobless growth describes a situation in which an economy recovers from a recession but the job market does not.

‚ÄúBut we should also know that our country has only two per cent technical workforce, against the requirement which is huge,‚Äù Dattatreya said.

However, the Union Minister for Labour and Employment said the Narendra Modi-led government‚Äôs initiatives such as ‚ÄòSkill India‚Äô aim to address this shortfall.

He said it was true that the statistics department showed that employment generation figures appeared to be on lower side.

‚ÄúBut I have not received confirmed data from 23 ministries about job creation in their respective fields. I have therefore set up a task force to compile the figures and come up with (figures of) actual employment generation,‚Äù he said.

The minister also said the current education system has too much emphasis on theory.

For instance, he said, in the engineering field 80 per cent curriculum is theory and 20 per cent is practical knowledge, while it should have been 75 per cent practical and 25 per cent theory.

‚ÄúWe need to have more practical approach towards educating the youth,‚Äù he added."

Cruz said a power surge, had ‚Äúonly lasted a few minutes‚Äù, but the back-up system of the airline had not worked properly.

He said the IT failure was not due to technical staff being outsourced from the UK to India.

Cruz told the BBC that he will not resign and that flight disruption had nothing to do with cutting costs.

‚ÄúI can confirm that all the parties involved around this particular event have not been involved in any type of outsourcing in any foreign country,‚Äù he told Sky News.

‚ÄúThey have all been local issues around a local data centre.‚Äù

BA‚Äôs GMB union has said outsourcing IT jobs to India could have made the problems worse.

The union spokesperson said it could have been avoided had ‚Äúhundreds of dedicated and loyal‚Äù not been replaced by cheaper Indian staff in 2016.

Cruz also said that no BA passengers‚Äô data had been compromised in the IT meltdown and said there was no evidence it was the result of a cyber attack, promising not to allow such an outage to happen again.

The IT failure was caused by a short but catastrophic power surge at 9.30 am on Saturday that affected the company‚Äôs messaging system, he said, and the backup system failed to work properly.

‚ÄúWe will have completed an exhaustive investigation on exactly the reasons of why this happened,‚Äù Cruz said. ‚ÄúWe will, of course, share those conclusions once we have actually finished them.

‚ÄúWe have no evidence whatsoever that there was any cyber attack of any sort.‚Äù

Cruz said he was ‚Äúprofusely sorry‚Äù to the thousands of passengers still stranded at airports worldwide.

He claimed two thirds of passengers will have reached their destination by the end of the day.

The BBC also reported of a leaked staff email revealed Cruz had told staff not to comment on the system failure.

When asked about the email he told the public broadcaster that the tone was clear: ‚ÄúStop moaning and come and help us‚Äù.

Until now, Cruz had only posted videos on Twitter apologising for what he called a ‚Äúhorrible time for passengers‚Äù, the report noted.

The airline is now close to full operational capacity after the problems resulted in mass flight cancellations at Heathrow and Gatwick over the weekend.

The airline cancelled 13 short-haul flights at Heathrow today.

Heathrow, Europe‚Äôs busiest airport, advised affected BA passengers not to travel to the airport unless their flights had been rebooked, or were scheduled to take off on Monday.

Passengers on cancelled flights have been told to use the BA website to rebook.

BA is liable to reimburse thousands of passengers for refreshments and hotel expenses, and travel industry experts have suggested the cost to the company ‚Äì part of Europe‚Äôs largest airline group IAG ‚Äì could run into tens of millions of pounds.

Davy analyst Stephen Furlong said the cost to the carrier of cancelling one day of operations was around 30 million pounds."

Releasing the ‚ÄúReal State of Economy 2017‚Äù, a document prepared by the Congress research cell at the party headquarters here, Singh said it speaks about the state of India‚Äôs economy, its many issues and where it is heading.

‚ÄúThat the Indian economy is not in a good state is obvious. Even IMF has downgraded our GDP growth and it will not be 7.6 per cent but less than 6.6 per cent,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram said the state of the economy ‚Äúis not something that we can be happy about‚Äù and expressed concern over the low credit growth which he claimed is at 5 per cent, the ‚Äúlowest in several decades‚Äù.

‚ÄúBJP is hiding behind a GDP number which is being challenged. People are not dazzled by it, but are asking where are the jobs?

‚ÄúNDA government tends to believe exaggerated version of economy, this research document is closer to truth than what government will say tomorrow,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram said every government must be optimistic, but optimism must stem from a realistic assessment of situation.

‚ÄúYet, if government presents tomorrow a rosy picture of the economy, people of India are entitled to question that.

There are no jobs, capital formation is declining, credit growth is the lowest in several decades,‚Äù he said.

Chidambaram wanted government to focus on fiscal consolidation and said, ‚Äúthere are serious question marks on this government‚Äôs ability to follow fiscal prudence‚Äù.

He dismissed suggestions that the 2008 farm loan waiver was a populist measure, saying, ‚ÄúIt was based on the response to a demand from the farming community and was a very wise decision.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis was especially so as the international financial crisis hit in September 2008, which crippled even major economies but did not affect India much,‚Äù he said.

He claimed that while there are no jobs, new capital investment and no credit growth, the document released ‚Äúcandidly, truthfully‚Äù assesses the state of India‚Äôs economy, supported by hard research and data.

Hoping that government will not cut social sector spending, the former Finance Minister claimed that the MNREGS was the lone scheme that provided some succour to poor by way of jobs.

‚ÄúThere is a 60 per cent spurt in demand for MNREGS jobs.

If they are cut, then it would be a very cruel cut. This demand is because of loss of jobs and. I sincerely hope that this government will not make this cardinal mistake of cutting expenditure,‚Äù he said.

Congress spokesperson Rajiv Gowda said, ‚ÄúThe slowdown in the Indian economy in the wake of demonetisation will last four to five years.‚Äù

He told the government that it should not use the issue of universal basic income tax an excuse to attack social safety net.

Rejecting Congress‚Äô charge, the BJP said India has become the fastest growing major economy under the leadership of Narendra Modi and the current account deficit will be eliminated in the next few months.

India has evolved as an oasis of economic growth stability and opportunity in the world under Modi government from one of the most fragile economies during the Congress regime, senior BJP leader and Power Minister Piyush Goyal said here.

Addressing media at the BJP headquarter soon after Congress briefing on the state of economy, Goyal said it is in strong hands and the Modi government has done historic work in strengthening all the macroeconomic parameters."

The Minister said the department will be creating a national repository that can be used by foreign employer or officials for verification of educational qualification of those seeking employment or employed abroad.

‚ÄúWe are coming down hard on illegal recruitment because we still find lot of agents who are not registered; they are able to fool people by showing them‚Ä¶what they will get abroad,‚Äù Singh said. He said, ‚ÄúThey take them on all kinds of routes. You will be surprised that lot of these domestic sector workers go on tourist visas‚Ä¶..we are taking action against them.‚Äù

Singh was responding to a question by a delegate from a Gulf country during a session on ‚ÄúConsular services to overseas Indians: Ensuring effective and efficient delivery‚Äù at the Pravasi Bharatiya Divas conclave in Bengaluru. Responding to a question on educational qualification related issues faced by those seeking employment abroad, the minister said they were creating a national repository which can be used by foreign officials or employers to verify the credentials of the employee.

‚ÄúOn the verification of educational qualification‚Ä¶.we are finding a permanent solution to this problem by creating a national repository which will have all the qualifications and data base from where anybody in the world can pickup and verify,‚Äù he said, adding, ‚ÄúYou will have that done very soon.‚Äù

Speaking about the steps being taken by the government to address the grievances, complaints and petitions of the migrant workers, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the PBD-2017 earlier today said that strict action is being taken against illegal recruitment agents in India. Prosecution sanctions by CBI or State Police against illegal agents and increase in the amount of Bank Guarantee deposited by the recruiting agents from Rs 20 lakh to Rs 50 lakh were some of the steps in this direction, he said.

On women housemaid issue, Singh said government has taken a very clear decision that no lady or a women worker less than 30 years of age will go outside the country.

‚ÄúWoman workers whether they have been recruited for any job will only go through the agencies established by the state government, so that no illegal recruitment takes place,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWith this condition that we have laid down of women workers of less than 30 years will not go out and second as a policy we have said that wherever we find fault we will charge those people for trafficking, that will ensure very strict legal action again such offenders,‚Äù he added.

Delivering a speech on ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs Empowerment: An Economic Game Changer‚Äù in Los Angeles, 60-year-old Lagarde said equal pay and better economic opportunities for women boost economic growth and create a bigger pie for everyone to share.

‚ÄúEmpowering women can be an economic game changer for any country. For instance, if women were to participate in the labour force to the same extent as men, national income could increase by five per cent in the US, nine per cent in Japan, and 27 per cent in India,‚Äù she said yesterday.

Better opportunities for women also promote diversity and reduce economic inequality around the world, she added.

‚ÄúTo put it differently: if you discourage half the population from fully participating in the labour market, you are essentially behaving like an airline pilot who shuts down half his engines in mid-flight. Sure, your plane will likely continue to fly, but it would be such a crazy thing to do,‚Äù Lagarde said.

Noting that across the globe women were still facing a triple-disadvantage and are less likely than men to have a paid job, Lagarde said only half of the world‚Äôs working-age women were employed.

‚ÄúIf they do find paid employment, it is more likely to be in the informal sector. And if they eventually get a job in the formal sector, they earn, on average, three-quarters as much as men even with the same level of education, and in the same occupation,‚Äù she said.

Lagarde said governments have a key role to play when it comes to economic incentives that provide women a fair shot in the labour market.

‚ÄúWe need to promote affordable childcare, parental leave, and workplace flexibility. We need to increase women‚Äôs access to finance and remove legal barriers that still exist in most countries,‚Äù she said.

‚ÄúWe also need to push for smarter tax policies, including here in the US. Think of tax reforms to help low-income families, which are disproportionately headed by women. And think of the benefits of reducing taxation on secondary earners in households, who are again mostly women,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúSo if you add up all things that can be done in each country, you get a powerful global impact. A global economic game changer,‚Äù Lagarde said, adding that most important countries have understood the need for gender equality, including the G20 grouping that account for 85 per cent of the world GDP and two-thirds of its population.

‚ÄúThese countries, including the US, have pledged to reduce the gap in women‚Äôs labour force participation by 25 per cent by the year 2025 which would create an estimated 100 million more jobs by 2025.

136,Skill India campaign: Manish Sisodia takes potshots at Centre,"Taking a dig at the Centre for using Sachin Tendulkar as brand ambassador for Skill India campaign and highlighting only carpentry, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Friday said a complete change in mindset is required to make millions of youth entering the job market fully equipped.

‚ÄúWhen we talk about skill, the biggest problem is the educated class has confined its definition to thinking that skill means carpenter, skill means welding. Interesting thing is that by using a brand ambassador like Sachin Tendulkar for Skill India, what kind of advertisements did we make, what kind of skills were promoted? We promoted skill like carpentry,‚Äù Sisodia said while speaking at the India Economic Summit here.

Calling for a holistic approach to the issue, Sisodia said: ‚ÄúI am not demeaning anything, but if we have to think about the future of Skill India, if we have to skill each and every student who are passing out from 10th or 12th class, we can‚Äôt ask each and every parent in this country to send their son or daughter to become a carpenter or a welder.‚Äù

In April this year, the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship had roped in Tendulkar to endorse its ambitious initiative of skilling 40.2 crore youth of the country by 2022 under its Skill India campaign.

Elaborating, the deputy chief minister said a broader outlook is need where skilling covers a wide variety of areas such as hospitality, retail or even providing delivery services for the burgeoning e-commerce sector.

‚ÄúWe have to have a clear vision. Right now, as a nation, as a society, I don‚Äôt think we have a clear vision over skill.

Because of this, sometimes we call it ITI, sometimes polytechnic, sometimes certificate course. We don‚Äôt call it skill in totality. We have never thought about it in totality and that‚Äôs where we are stuck,‚Äù Sisodia added.

Equal emphasis must be given to smaller aspects like driving, security guard, salesperson at a retail shop, or a waiter.

Airing similar views, LinkedIn Corporation India Managing Director Akshay Kothari said: ‚ÄúAlthough initiatives like Skill India are steps in the right direction, if you ask those who got skilled, most of them are having a problem in getting a gate, from getting an opportunity.‚Äù

He further spoke of how a lot of college students have spent the family‚Äôs fortune to get a college degree and now are struggling to get a job.

‚ÄúIndia is producing eight million college graduates every year and studies have shown that more than half of them are unemployable,‚Äù Kothari said.

The news was also picked up by foreign media and appeared across many publications in USA, Europe and Middle East.

However, the NSSO report requires a more nuanced analysis than just a sensational headline. Before comparing the outcome of this survey with any data points in the past, the following additional parameters should be taken into consideration.

New methodology / New sampling criteria

Till 2012, jobs data was based on Employment Unemployment Survey (EUS) which was conducted once every 5 years. After 2016, jobs data are now based on Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) which measures quarterly changes in labor market.

In EUS 2011-12, households for survey were selected based on levels of livelihood (rural) and expenditure (urban). However, in PLFS 2017-18, households for survey were selected based on the levels of education.

Issues with the new sampling technique

There are two issues with this basis of sampling.

First, the sample selection impacts the outcome. In statistics, samples need to be random. It is discouraged to select a sample based on a criterion that itself affects the behavior that one is trying to explain.

To illustrate through a crude analogy, let‚Äôs consider a survey for election results. For this the surveyors select ‚Äúhouseholds with number of family members that support AAP‚Äù with 0, 1, 2+ members as 25%, 50% and 25% weightage respectively.

This would ensure that sample of households where no one supports AAP (0 option) gets only 25% representation, whereas supporters (1 or 2+) get 75% weightage. This survey would predict good support for AAP, but it may not be the ground reality because of the inherent problem with sample selection criteria that directly impact the outcome.

Similarly, Education level directly affects labor market participation hence the outcome of survey is expected to be skewed.

Secondly, sample weightage is not aligned with ground realities.

In India, the number of households where NO ONE in the family has attained secondary level education is 75% (for rural) and 46% (for urban). However, in NSSO survey sample, only 25% of selected households represent low education.

Effectively, people with lower levels of education who comprise a much larger section of actual workforce (66%) have been grossly under-represented (25%) in the survey sample.

Impact of the new sampling technique

In India, joblessness rises with education level.

The data from 2011 census shows that unemployment numbers are higher for people with higher education (15%) compared to those with lower education (8%).

A report by World Economic Forum (WEF) also showed similar trend. Unemployment was more than 8% for graduates and post graduates. It was only 1% for people with less than primary education.

The reason for this phenomenon is explained by the fact that in India, 90% of the jobs are in unorganized sector like construction, daily wage workers, taxi drivers, small time retailers, casual contract workers and self-employed professionals. Less educated section of the workforce is more likely to take up such jobs. Consequently, the higher the education level attained, the more people are unemployed.

Either NSSO should not have used education level as the criterion for sample (because education level directly impacts the outcome of unemployment data) or the sample sizes should have been inline with the population data.

Since NSSO survey includes more households with higher education, unemployment data is showing a sudden jump.

Other prominent inaccuracies in the data

The report indicates that in the last six years, unemployment suddenly increased from 2.1% to 6.1% (a ‚Äú45 years high‚Äù).

At the same time, the report also indicates that in the last six years, India‚Äôs population has decreased by 1.3% and is now at just a little over 1 billion. Urbanization has also decreased by 5.8%.

Both these are incorrect because in reality, both the population and urbanization have been constantly increasing. Per census, India‚Äôs population is estimated at 1.3 billion (not 1.074 billion). These counter intuitive outcomes indicate to some structural fault with method / data which is yielding unreliable outcomes.

Is unemployment really at 45 year high?

In India, jobs data is published by multiple agencies / sources including ‚Äì

NSSO survey data (once every 5 years)

Labor Bureau Reports

CMIE (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy), a non-govt agency that publishes monthly data

United Nations ILO (International Labor Organization) Reports

EPFO publishes monthly data on subscriber additions

CII (Confederation of Indian Industry) data from Industry

Of these, CII estimates that MSME industries created 14 million jobs every year in last four years. As per United Nations ILO‚Äôs ‚ÄòWorld Employment and Social Outlook: Trends 2018‚Äô report, from 2016 to 2019 unemployment in India remained largely at the same 3.4% to 3.5% level.

Different agencies use different methods and arrive at different data points for unemployment in India. PLFS has been used for the first time and it is unfair to compare its outcome (6.1%) with any other data point in the past.

Still if one were to persist in apples to oranges comparison, it must be noted that as per the last census in 2011, unemployment at every segment of workforce varied from 7% to 15%. Overall unemployment was as high as 9.6%.

If unemployment in 2011 was 9.6%, then it is definitely inaccurate to claim that at 6.1% unemployment in 2018 is at 45 years high.

Summary:

Yes, India needs a relentless focus on job creation. Almost 5 million Indians are entering work force every year and India needs to constantly create new jobs. Specifically, India needs to create high quality and higher paying jobs in the formal organized sector which is where the higher educated workforce can make bigger contribution to the economy.

India also needs to increase education attainment levels. Forbes indicates that India is creating millions of high skilled jobs, but many are not finding enough skilled workers.

Yet, 6.1% unemployment in India is not an earth-shattering number by itself. A look at currently world‚Äôs Top 15 economies indicates that unemployment in France, Italy, Brazil and Spain is at 8%, 10%, 12% and 14% respectively. These are high but not enough to start ringing alarm bells.

All in all, even at 6.1% as measured by the new methodology, unemployment in India is NOT at ‚Äú45 years high‚Äù. That‚Äôs a meaningless exaggeration without any basis in facts or data."
139,‚ÄòUnemployment at 45 year high‚Äô is fake liberal fantasy based on an obviously wrong data,"There is an old saying that if you have a favourite food, never find out how it‚Äôs made. You may no longer be able to eat it.

Today we will apply the same principle to liberals‚Äô favourite ‚Äòfact‚Äô about the Indian economy: the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô that shows that unemployment has reached a 45 year high.

Today we will find out how this number was calculated (cooked?). What are the components that went into this number?

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

So let me tell you some ‚Äòfacts‚Äô about India.

Did you know who was the greatest beneficiary of demonetization? It was the casual workers, the ones who work in the informal sector and have to live on daily wages that are mostly paid in cash.

And do you know who suffered the most? It was salaried workers, usually the ones who get their pay credited directly to their bank accounts every month by their employer.

When demonetization hit, the formal economy apparently ran out of internet connections. Instead, the informal economy did very well, apparently because demonetization increased the availability of ready cash they do business in.

Don‚Äôt believe me? I‚Äôm not kidding. The ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô actually found this. Real wages (i.e, inflation-adjusted wages) of casual workers are up by 22% between 2011 and 2017. On the other hand, the real wages of salaried workers are down by nearly 20% since 2011 and 2017.

Thank you demonetization for ushering in economic justice on a scale unprecedented in world history. And thank you, Surjit Bhalla, for uncovering all the good news in the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô.

You‚Äôve all heard about the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô. The one that Modi sarkar is apparently trying to suppress. You know, the one that supposedly shows unemployment in India has reached a 45 year high. The liberal media just can‚Äôt stop talking about it.

But what the liberal media won‚Äôt tell you is how much good news is there in the same ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô.

For instance, did you know just how well the rural economy is doing? It‚Äôs going so good that people are leaving the cities and going back to villages to enjoy the boom in the rural economy. According to ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô, India‚Äôs urbanization has dipped from 31% in 2011 to 29% now!

Rural distress? What rural distress?

And to think that all our media have left behind their comfortable homes in Lutyens Delhi to understand the ‚Äòrural distress‚Äô in the countryside. Come back! Stop wasting your time. Come back to the big city, which is now less crowded according to ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô! Leave the crowded villages behind and come back to our empty cities!

As if that was not good news enough, did you know that India‚Äôs population has declined too? The ‚ÄòNSSO data‚Äô also finds that India‚Äôs population is just 107 crore people and not 130 crore people.

There is only one explanation for this is that 23 crore Indians must be currently on vacation abroad, enjoying the sights of New York and Paris. And liberals say the economy isn‚Äôt doing well! Come on!

Defines belief? Yes! But these are the numbers that went into calculating (cooking?) the number of ‚Äòunemployment at 45 year high‚Äô. You can‚Äôt choose to believe the headline number and refuse the components that went into it.

What is shocking is that until now, nobody in media or intelligentsia seems to have put in the bare minimum effort to carry out a sanity check on the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô. The media simply ran with it and the secular establishment was only too happy to weaponize the headline into a stick to beat the government with.

You might remember that recently an ‚Äòauspicious‚Äô number of economists wrote an open letter attacking the government over these supposed figures. These were supposed to be scholars, people with research credentials, people who have been trained to read beyond the headlines and cross-check facts. Could they not have caught these obvious mistakes in the ‚Äòleaked NSSO data‚Äô with five to ten minutes of effort? But they didn‚Äôt. They jumped on the propaganda bandwagon. No surprise that most of these ‚Äôeminent economists‚Äô were members of the left-liberal complex, some had signed up with their entire families and academic descendants and some were even associated with the Congress campaign.

This is a betrayal of the trust of the Indian people in media and intelligentsia on a scale never seen before.

Propaganda newspapers, propaganda news channels and propagandist intellectuals created a storm of outrage around a piece of ‚Äòunemployment data‚Äô that was obviously wrong.

There is only one question left to ask. How did NSSO make such massive and glaring mistakes? Surjit Bhalla attributes this to a bizarre change in sampling and survey methods. Very well, that‚Äôs one possibility. But considering the scale on which the ‚Äòleaked data‚Äô was publicized and used as a propaganda weapon, we common people have to consider other possibilities. Was their deliberate malpractice involved? Did deep assets in the bureaucracy try to help a certain political party by rigging the data or the methods of data collection? We don‚Äôt know. But we do have a right to ask."
140,Unemployment soars in Madhya Pradesh,"Days after Congress-friendly organisation, CMIE, which allegedly has close links to Congress and P Chidambaram, gave a thumbs up to Congress‚Äô Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government by claiming there is 40% drop in unemployment, the actual figures say otherwise. The number of registered unemployed youth in Madhya Pradesh has grown by seven lakh in just a year taking it to 28 lakh while about 34,000 youth got jobs in that one year.

As reported by Economic Times, the rise in number of registered unemployed youth could be the poll promise Congress made ahead of 2018 state assembly elections wherein they promised Rs 4,000 unemployment allowance to unemployed youth. While campaigning in the state for the assembly elections, then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had announced last year that the unemployed youth in the state will be provided with an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month. In February this year, the Kamal Nath government had announced that the young men and women in urban areas will receive an amount of Rs 4000 per month and under another plan, they will be provided work for a minimum of 100 days. However, in July this year, Kamal Nath had done a u-turn on his poll promise and said that the government has no plan to give unemployment bonus to the youth in Madhya Pradesh.

In Madhya Pradesh, the total registered unemployed youth were 20,77,222 in October 2018 which rose to 27,79,725 in October, 2019 just days after CMIE report showed 40% drop in joblessness in Madhya Pradesh. In fact, Kamal Nath‚Äôs office had even patted their back for bringing down unemployment in the state. Madhya Pradesh Labour Minister Mahendra Singh Sisodia had termed it a ‚Äògreat achievement‚Äô and had urged the Centre to learn from the state as per the Times of India report.

Read: CMIE, that has ties to P Chidambaram and fear-mongered about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô was a part of Congress Manifesto Committee

It is pertinent to note that CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey, is wholly owned by Mr Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam.

Shah has been accused of accessing data from NSE on a preferential basis in connivance with the authorities and sharing this data with certain stockbrokers for use in High-Frequency Trading. The scam is being investigated by SEBI, CBI as well as by Income Tax authorities. The current MD of CMIE is Mahesh Vyas, who happens to be the brother-in-law of Ajay Shah. Ajay Shah is a very close confidante of former Union Minister and Congress leader P. Chidambaram who recently came out after spending 106 days in Tihar Jail in INX Media case where he is accused of corruption."
141,"Leaked NSSO report on unemployment not finalised and verified, not correct to use it as final: NITI Aayog","The NITI Ayog has said that the ‚Äúleaked‚Äù National Sample Survey of Office (NSSO) report which showed the unemployment rate during July 2017-June 2018 at 6.1 percent, a 45-year high, is not verified. Hours after the NSSO report came out in media, the NITI Aayog clarified that it was a draft report which is still being processed and that the data in the report is not finalised.

NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar said that the Government did not release the data which is still being processed and will release the report when it is ready. The government think-tank said that the Employment Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data shows that 4.8 million additional jobs have been created. ‚ÄúData collection method is different now we are using a computer-assisted personal interviewee in the new survey. It is not right to compare the two data sets, this data is not verified. It is not correct to use this report as final.‚Äù Kumar added.

NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said that enough jobs are being created but there is a lack of good quality jobs. ‚ÄúThe NITI Aayog analysis shows that we are creating 7-8 million jobs. Conventional estimates had suggested that there are 12 million new entrants per year. New estimates suggest that because of higher education and declining women‚Äôs labour population, the country needs 7 million jobs‚Äù, Kant said.

After the report was leaked earlier in the day, the opposition started attacking the government. Congress President Rahul Gandhi had termed it a ‚Äúnational disaster‚Äù."
142,CMIE report says 4 million jobs added in last one year,"The Congress party and its ecosystem had aggressively latched on to ‚Äòunemployment‚Äô bogey with questionable sets of data on jobs to try and push Narendra Modi government into a corner ahead of the 2019 elections. One of the sources that the opposition used to claim job loss was a report by CMIE, an organisation allegedly close to the Congress party and P Chidambaram. Their survey had claimed that nearly 10 million jobs were lost during the year 2018.

CMIE has published its latest report on employment, and it suggests that job loss has stopped and employment has started increasing in the country. According to their latest report, 4 million jobs have been added in the last year, hinting at a recovery of employment opportunities in the country.

First, Indian economy growing but no jobs.

Now, Indian economy in slowdown but jobs are increasing.

Highly potent stuff. ? pic.twitter.com/qGNEj3YJaT ‚Äî Sumit (@_RKSumit) October 1, 2019

In the run-up to 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Mahesh Vyas ‚Äì the MD and CEO of the CMIE and also the brother-in-law of P Chidambaram‚Äôs close confidante Ajay Shah, had released data on jobs stating that nearly 10 million jobs were lost in a span of a year from December 2017 to December 2018.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

In his new report, released post elections, CMIE says that there has been an increase in employment in the country with more than 405 million people have been employed during May-August 2019 compared to 401 million people who were employed during the September-December in 2018. This report claims that there has been a turnaround in employment from a steep falling trend to a gradually rising trend.

The report further states that out of the 405 million employed in the country, 129 million people belonged to Urban areas while 276 million people were employed in rural areas.

‚ÄúThe 405 million people estimated to be employed during the May-August 2019 were 0.6 million higher than the employed during the January-April 2019 and 3.9 million higher than the preceding survey conducted during September-December 2018,‚Äù states CMIE survey. ‚ÄúCumulatively, the count of the employed has risen over 4 million over the past three surveys,‚Äù writes Mahesh Vyas in his report.

The employment report states there is an increase in employment by at least 2.5 million in one year, comparing May-August number for 2019 with the same period in 2018, taking off the effects of seasonality.

However, the report also states that although the number of employed has increased, it is far from sufficient. It says that an increase in 2.5 million jobs only absorbed 22 per cent of the people who sought jobs during the time period. According to the report, the labour force increased by 11.3 million while only 2.5 million jobs were provided in last one year from May-August 2018 to May-August 2019.

Mahesh Vyas further reports that in 2019, there is a rise in the number of unemployed with the continued growth of employment opportunities in the country in the last year. But he says that there is a reason to celebrate the increase in the unemployed, as their increase is an indication of an increase in the hopes for finding jobs.

He also says that the economy seems to be recovering from the disruptions of demonetisation and GST implementation. But the recovery in jobs is extremely fragile and tentative.

The report states that although the number of employed has risen to 405 million, it was 408 million in May-August in 2016, which means the economy is yet to provide employment at the same scale."
143,Here is why comparing the recent job data with past data is faulty and foolish,"In January this year, some data on jobs from the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted by National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) was leaked, which had created a big furore in the country. Based on the leaked incomplete data, several media houses and intellectuals had claimed that India‚Äôs unemployment rate for the year 2017-18 was at the highest level in 45 years. Opposition parties had used such analysis based on incomplete leaked data to attack the government before and during the Lok Sabha elections.

Today the Periodic Labour Force Survey report was officially released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation. Going through the same, it can be said that there can be nothing farther away from the truth than saying that unemployment in India is at a 45 year low! The report confirms the leaked figure of 6.1% unemployment rate, but there are crucial details which make the difference. The report shows that the method to calculate jobs data has been changed, hence it can‚Äôt be compared with past data.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Past jobs data was measured using the expenditure of households as a criterion. The current jobs data uses education as a criterion instead of expenditure. This means this has become a perfect ‚Äòapples to oranges‚Äô comparison.

In India, the labour force surveys (Employment and Unemployment Surveys or EUS) have usually been bundled along with the household Consumer Expenditure Survey, conducted typically once in 5 years. The employment and unemployment surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey till 2011-12 used the monthly per capita expenditure of the household in the selected villages/blocks as a basis for stratification of households.

In the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) conducted for the year 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

This change in criteria from monthly per capita expenditure to education levels has direct implications on the comparability of the results of PLFS with the EUS of earlier years. In view of this, the PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis.

It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen. Thus, they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or workforce requiring low skills and low remuneration. The PLFS results give the distribution of educated and unemployed persons across the country which can be used as a basis for skilling of youth to make them more employable by industry.

There are various facets to the employment and unemployment scenario and no single data source is complete by itself. These data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market. In this direction, the Ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to EPFO, ESIC and NPS to give an assessment of changes in the formal market employment. The PLFS survey data complemented by administrative data and data from other sources need to be triangulated to get a complete picture."
144,How realistic is Prime Minister Modi‚Äôs target of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024,"India‚Äôs Prime Minister Mr Narendra Modi has declared his vision of making India a $5 trillion economy by 2024. The hallmark of visionary leaders is that they set audacious targets and then achieve them. However, the roadmap to achieve this goal is not devoid of its share of challenges. A deeper look into the current economic situation and required growth rates to achieve this milestone would reveal that this would be a ‚Äústretch goal‚Äù which is achievable but not without significant action on economic reforms.

As per the published data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), India‚Äôs GDP in 2018 was $2.7 trillion. IMF forecast for India‚Äôs GDP in 2024 is $4.7 trillion. These estimates are in-line with Morgan Stanley which forecasts India‚Äôs GDP to touch $5 trillion by 2025.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

The INR/USD exchange rate assumed by the IMF for future years in the above analysis is shown in the table below. The green cells contain data taken from IMF and white cells show the calculated values.

From the IMF estimates above, it can be inferred that if ‚Äì

India‚Äôs nominal GDP grows at about 11.8% per year

and inflation hovers at around 4% to 4.2% per year (hence real GDP growth = 7.6% to 7.8% per year)

and INR depreciates at no more than 2% per year (INR/USD exchange rate in 2024 is less than 79)

Then India‚Äôs nominal GDP would be approximately $4.7 trillion in 2024.

The size of the economy in 2024 could exceed $4.7 trillion, if the GDP growth rate picks up or if Rupee stays stronger than the above estimates. For example, if real GDP grows at 7.6% per year, but the currency exchange rate in 2024 stays at the levels of INR 75 per USD then nominal GDP would hit $4.9 trillion in US dollar terms.

Challenges

Unfortunately, the global economy is currently going through a slowdown as all major economies of the world are facing headwinds. As of 2019, USA is facing an economic slowdown. China‚Äôs GDP growth is at 27 years low and Industrial Output is at 17 years low. Germany is facing a recession (not a slowdown of growth, but actual CONTRACTION of the economy). France‚Äôs growth is declining across industries. In Britain, investments are down to 17 years low. Japan‚Äôs factory output has slumped. Australia‚Äôs GDP growth is at 20 years low. Singapore is facing a recession. South Korea exports are down for 8 consecutive months and the world economy is expected to grow at its slowest pace since the financial crisis of 2008.



With all major economies of the world going through turbulence, India‚Äôs economic growth is expected to face a temporary slowdown too. During such scenarios, exports may find it tough to rise and investments may dry down which would make the target even stiffer.

Opportunities

At the same time, the ongoing US-China trade war can be potentially leveraged as a huge one-time opportunity. Towards the year 1999, the global issue of Y2K migration had presented an opportunity that was seized with both hands by the Indian IT companies. That one-time window of opportunity helped nascent Indian IT companies to grow by leaps and bounds and become global behemoths. The current US-China trade war presents a similar opportunity that could potentially help India‚Äôs Manufacturing sector grow rapidly.



As per USISPF, hundreds of companies are currently looking to relocate their manufacturing base from China. Elon Musk had expressed his desire to start Tesla Manufacturing in India. If Government of India could swiftly come up with policy reforms for companies looking to start manufacturing in India, it could lead to the rapid expansion of India‚Äôs Manufacturing sector with large scale job creation, increased exports and rapid economic growth.

Structural reforms like IBC, GST and others have helped India jump World Bank‚Äôs Ease of Doing Business rankings from 142 (in 2014) to 63 (in 2019). That‚Äôs a quantum jump signifying a marked improvement in starting new businesses in the country. In another favourable policy change, the government has slashed corporate tax rates from 30% to 22% for existing companies and from 25% to 15% for new manufacturing companies. Including a surcharge and cess, the effective tax rate for existing companies would now come down from 35% to 25.17%. This makes India a highly attractive investment destination for companies looking to set up manufacturing.

In a continued slew of reforms, the government may also announce a dedicated relationship manager for any entity investing more than $500 million in India. Such an officer would help the investor with all government clearances at the centre and state levels.

The Road Ahead

The above steps show the government‚Äôs intent to fuel economic growth. However, while the above are necessary, they may not be sufficient by themselves. As the above analysis illustrates, an aggressive increase in exports is not only the key to boost economic growth but would also strengthen INR to propel the nominal GDP even higher.



For the last few years, India‚Äôs exports have stayed stagnant. Recently, a government panel has reported that an Exports growth rate of 10% is achievable. It requires India to reduce the cost of capital and introduce labour reforms that facilitate easier business expansion. Making labour laws more flexible would enable firms, particularly in labour-intensive sectors, to scale up rapidly. This would create more jobs in the MSME sector which is traditionally the backbone of the Indian economy for sustainable growth, employment generation, development of entrepreneurial skills and contribution to export earnings.

Another recommendation to increase exports is through a renewed focus on Free Trade Agreements (FTAs). In that direction, it might be worthwhile to consider that by early November 2019, India may sign up RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) deal. RCEP is a Free Trade Agreement between ten ASEAN countries along with six additional members that include India, China, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea. In the currently proposed form, RCEP would be the world‚Äôs largest economic bloc, covering nearly half of the global economy.

Read: All you wanted to know about the RCEP, the trade deal forming the world‚Äôs largest economic block

RCEP requires member countries to provide duty-free access to their markets to each other. This makes RCEP a double-edged sword. While some trade organizations in India fear that this might help Chinese goods to flood Indian markets, the treaty also has its benefits for Indian exports. For agricultural products like rice, India has a competitive advantage and RCEP would open up ASEAN countries as a new 10 million tonne market for India. The treaty would also enable Indian industry to join global supply chains for high-end goods such as electronics and engineering.

Additionally, the government is also pursuing a limited trade deal with the USA to reinstate GSP (Generalized System of Preference) for India. GSP is the largest US trade preference programme and is designed to promote economic development by allowing duty-free entry for thousands of products from designated beneficiary countries.

If India signs up RCEP and the limited trade deal with the USA, then it might provide a significant opportunity to increase exports in the coming years. It would also compel Indian manufacturers to create globally competitive products for local consumption and exports, lest they lose out to cheaper imports from China, Vietnam and South Korea.

Summary

The key to hitting the $5 trillion mark is increasing exports, reducing the cost of capital and bringing flexible labour laws. While the government has taken some steps in the above direction, more action on economic reforms is still required.

Eventually, whether India‚Äôs nominal GDP reaches $5 trillion by 2024 or is stuck at below $4.7 trillion is dependent on how the various global factors play out and how the Government of India rolls out economic reforms to propel the economy."
145,Kamal Nath government has no plans for unemployment allowances,"The Kamal Nath government has made a u-turn on their pre-election promise of giving unemployment allowance to the youth in the state. As per reports, Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath stated in the assembly yesterday that his government has no plan to give unemployment bonus to the youth in the state.

Kamal Nath made the announcement as a reply to MLA Munnalal Goyal‚Äôs question. Earlier, the Congress government had promised that it will pay an unemployment allowance up to Rs 4000 to the registered unemployed youth in the state.

Congress MLA Munnalal Goyal had asked in the assembly yesterday whether the state government has any plans to keep its election promise and whether there are any plans to create new jobs for the registered unemployed youth in the state.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

CM Kamal Nath had submitted a written reply to the question, saying that the government has no plans to give an allowance. He added that through the implementation of various state and central schemes, the government is trying to provide skill training to the youth so they can be employed in the private sector.

Previously, leader of the opposition Gopal Bhargav had stated that the Congress government in Madhya Pradesh had cheated the youth of the state by not keeping its election promise. He added that the state budget has made no mention of any kind of unemployment allowance, only clever wordplay.

Bhargav also pointed out that instead of publicising the branding of Mava Bati, Jalebi, and Chiraunji Barfi, the state government should take concrete steps to fulfil the promises on which they sought votes from the people.

While campaigning in the state for the assembly elections, then Congress president Rahul Gandhi had announced last year that the unemployed youth in the state will be provided with an allowance of Rs 10,000 per month. The Kamal Nath government has made no progress to fulfil that claim either.

It is notable here that the Kamal Nath government had earlier announced a ‚ÄòYuva Swabhiman Yojna‚Äô for giving allowance to the unemployed youth in the state. The Madya Pradesh cabinet had also approved the proposal.

In February this year, the Kamal Nath government had announced that the young men and women in urban areas will receive an amount of Rs 4000 per month and under another plan, they will be provided work for a minimum of 100 days. The opposition is alleging that after much fanfare and publicity, the government has now reneged on its promises."
146,The IT-industry shows a 38% rise in job creation since last year: Report,"According to latest reports, the IT industry has shown continuous growth in the recruitment landscape over the past six months, recording a rise of 38 percent growth surpassing the 12 percent national average hike in hirings on a year-on-year basis from March 2018, says Naukri JobSpeak report.

The Naukri JobSpeak Index for March 2019, stood at 2,378, which is 12 percent higher in hiring activities from March 2018, which stood at 2,129. Also among all the major metro cities, Bangaluru topped the list, as it contributed 18 percent of the total recruitments.

The report reveals that industries such as IT Software, IT Hardware, BPO/ITES, FMCG have witnessed an increase in hirings in March 2019 compared to March 2018. While the IT-industry has been recording an increase from 32 percent to 38 percent, Construction and Engineering saw an increase of 13 percent, BPO/ITES by 9 percent, FMCG by 5 percent, Education by 7 percent and IT-Hardware by 3 percent.

InfoEdge India CMO Sumeet Singh said, ‚ÄúThe JobSpeak index continues with its positive growth in hiring with a 12 percent rise when compared to the same period last year. Our latest hiring outlook survey showed 89 percent recruiters from the IT industry stating that new jobs and replacement hiring will play a strong role in hiring. Hopefully, the momentum will be sustained in the coming months.‚Äù

The Naukri JobSpeak is a monthly Index which calculates and records hiring activity based on the job listings on Naukri.com website month on month.

Further, the report revealed that the demand for mid-level executives, in the experienced band of 4-7 years, grew by 14 percent whereas recruitment for entry-level jobs, with an experienced band of 0-3 years, witnessed a rise of 12 percent.

Naukri.com, one of India‚Äôs premier job portals, had also published the findings of its Hiring Outlook survey which depicted a very bright scenario for employment opportunities in the country between January to June 2019.

Earlier too, despite much brouhaha created by the Congress over job creation, multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year.

In fact, it was also disclosed lately that CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey and which was instrumental in fear-mongering about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô has a long and interesting history as it is wholly owned by Mr. Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram."
147,"Parle responds to reports of 10,000 potential job losses, says no job loss yet, definite slowdown but issue blown out of proportion","In an interview with the media outlet BTVi, senior category head at Parle Products, Mayank Shah clarified that there have been no job losses at Parle yet and that the issue has been blown out of proportion by naysayers. There were reports recently that slowdown could force ParleG to lay off 10,000 staff members.

Shah added that there has been a marked decline in the sales of their products, attributing the slumping sales to the GST tax slab for biscuits below Rs 100 per kg, which attracts 18% GST.

Parle Clarifies No Job Losses Yet, Issue Blown Out Of Proportion https://t.co/NAw2RHnkqm as usual these rumours were spread by @INCIndia and their Supporters @AMadumoole ‚Äî mamta Nigam ‡§Æ‡§Æ‡§§‡§æ ! (@mamtan14) August 23, 2019

‚ÄúBiscuit as an industry or category has been severely affected. This phenomenon is industry-wide and not Parle specific. The consumer is thinking twice before buying biscuits now. Biscuits which were earlier exempted from excise were now included after the advent of the GST. This has had a serious effect on the sales of the basic biscuits which are less than Rs 100 per Kg. Right now, basic biscuits fall under the same 18 per cent GST slab as the premium biscuits,‚Äù Shah said.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Shah further stated that their company has been requesting the government from last 1 year to look into the matter. ‚ÄúPremium segment biscuits which are sold at or above Rs 100 per kg and basic biscuits which are less than Rs 100 per Kg are two different categories. We have been requesting the government to provide concessions to us in basic biscuits category by changing its GST slab as it did with apparels, footwear and other commodities,‚Äù Shah said.

Dismissing the reports of downsizing at Parle Products, Shah said that the job losses will be an eventuality if the sales of the basic biscuits category continue to decline. Once the category which used to grow at 10-12 per cent per annum is currently declined by 7-8 per cent.

‚ÄúSales of premium biscuits at Parle are showing impressive growth. However, the sales of the basic biscuits category which is for the consumption of common man is getting the beating after the implementation of GST. We have to take a price hike because of the GST. We urge the government to exempt basic biscuits, which are priced less than Rs 100 per Kg be exempted from the tax like it was before the GST,‚Äù Shah said."

These protests were also for ‚Äòrising unemployment‚Äô, ‚Äòsinking economy‚Äô and ‚Äòfarmer distress‚Äô.

As 5th November flew by, Congress woke up and realised they missed yet another deadline. So on 6th November, they announced new dates of protests, this time, a combined protest with other parties.

149,"Around 15 million jobs created by the Modi govt per year, but the ‚Äòliberal‚Äô propaganda won‚Äôt stop","One of the best articles I read last week was by Dr Surjit S. Bhalla which provided an explanation behind the rise of the use of fake news and fake analysis. The article linked the rise of fake news and of questioning the data on the economy to the record performance of Congress in 2014 as it managed to get its lowest ever tally in its history. The article got me thinking and eventually, I realized that I agree with this conclusion as there has been a lot of unnecessary politicization of a lot of things post 2014 by the opposition.

Ironically, a lot of the new-age media platforms and self-claimed fact checkers have also frequently peddled fake-news that has been then cited by opposition leaders to corner the Modi Government. It takes time to debunk fake-news and the opposition has constructively used this fact to its advantage as it tried to set its own narrative. This article focuses on the issue of jobs as we try to understand the reality of employment creation. At the onset, I must state that I had indicated way back on 22nd May 2018 that missing data on jobs will play a critical role in the 2019 elections. I had also stated in the same article how the issue is not the lack of jobs but the lack of data on jobs.

The issue around PLFS and CMIE

At the onset, I must emphasize that the government should release the Periodic Labor Force Survey (PLFS) to ensure that there is at least some data that can be objectively analyzed by individual researchers. Chances are that PLFS may have findings that may not be consistent with other indicators of job creation in the economy- if that‚Äôs the case then they should make the report public to identify potential flaws in the survey so that it could be improved in future.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

On PLFS being used and compared with the previous employment and unemployment survey, Mr Kant has rightfully put how they both can‚Äôt be compared due to the differences in sampling techniques. So, all the exclusive headlines by ‚Äúeminent journalists‚Äù are just headlines that are devoid of any substance and are only serving the interest of those who benefit from such fraudulent analysis as they mislead their readers and construct a false narrative.

A bulk of the criticism on the lack of jobs from the opposition has come with the start of CMIE‚Äôs data on jobs [OpIndia has already expressed concerns regarding the reliability of CMIE‚Äôs data and you can read that article by clicking here]. While the sample size of most labour force surveys in India has been historically small, the important aspect is whether CMIE is drawing its sample without any skewness in its sampling technique. Mohandas Pai and Yash Baid make a compelling argument against the use of thin surveys as against verifiable and robust data sets such as EPFO, NPS and PPF.

The true picture of jobs

Now the key question in front of us is the true reality of the labour market over the last five years. I refrained from writing it extensively because there was relatively less data points that were available a couple of months ago [an old blog on this issue can be accessed by clicking here], but now, with multiple data points available we can finally make sound conclusions regarding the situation of job creation in the economy.

Dr Bhalla and Dr Das have arrived at an approximate estimate of 8.7 million annual jobs being added by the government. This is based on the estimate of total employment of 448 million in the year 2017/18. Their estimate seems robust and it is likely to be closer to the true scenario of job creation in the economy.

More that arriving at an exact estimate, let us try to establish the situation of jobs. As evident, Dr Bhalla and Dr Das have provided an estimate that shows the positive situation of jobs. It is also important to highlight that these estimates use the EPFO and NPS data both of which also show a positive trend in the job‚Äôs growth post demonetization. EPFO data has improved over subsequent months. In fact, 72.32 lakh new subscribers were added to social security schemes of the Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) from September 2017 to December 2018 as formal sector jobs touch 16-month high at 7.16 lakh in December. This further indicates that there‚Äôs a positive change in the data so there must be robust job creation within the economy.

A criticism of the use of EPFO is that it tends to represent more formalization of jobs rather than fresh creation of jobs, but those who criticize the EPFO dataset on these grounds also believe that demonetization didn‚Äôt lead to improved tax compliance and more formalization so clearly, their argument is incoherent. Indeed, EPFO data represents a formal sector of jobs and it is likely that some informal jobs may be becoming formal but the robust jobs growth in the 18-21 age group suggests that there must be a high proportion of the EPFO subscribers who are first-time employees. The latest numbers from EPFO suggests that for the categories of sub-18, 18-21 and 22-25 age groups, there has been an addition of 4 million jobs and a bulk of these must be first-time employees. These jobs are formal jobs that come with all social security benefits, so there is a robust creation of good and decent jobs in the economy.

Another source of job creation comes from Mohandas Pai and Yash Baid‚Äôs analysis using the data for automobile sector where they found that the sector created 3.4 million jobs in FY18, with a further 2.8 million jobs created in the 9 months ended December 31, 2018. The automobile sector tends to grow only when there is robust demand for automobiles which is again a very healthy sign for the growth of the Indian economy. This robust demand further indicates that the labour market continues to be robust.

Moving on to another indicator, an Aon Hewitt survey indicates that the average salary hike in 2018 is 9.4%. If indeed the labour market would have witnessed massive layoffs and unemployment was at an all-time high, then clearly labour supply would have gone up which would have suppressed incomes. The argument of hysteresis as advocated by some is not valid here as labour supply would have invariably gone up because the unemployment if at all was high (which it wasn‚Äôt), it wasn‚Äôt high for a prolonged period. Additionally, India has witnessed very moderate inflation for this period so even the real salary hike on an average is robust and positive. Thus, clearly, there must be jobs in the economy which is why companies are keen on retaining their talent.

Leading HR platforms such as Naukri.com also produces its index to measure the employment situation in the country. According to their report, there was a 3 per cent addition in hiring by companies in March 2018 compared to March 2017. Yet again, we find their findings to be consistent with other indicators of job creation in the economy. In the digital space, there are estimates that suggest that the start-up and digital economy added 3.9 million jobs between 2014-18. This means 0.975 million jobs annually.

Recently, even the CII came out with its own numbers for the MSME sector which tends to employ a significant proportion of India‚Äôs non-agriculture labour force. According to their report, MSMEs created 14% more jobs in the last four years. This is consistent with the acceleration in growth rates of the GDP that the Indian economy has witnessed over the last couple of years along with the revival of the investment cycle in the economy. The report estimates a total of 13.5-14.9 million job additions per annum. These estimates are again indicative of robust job creation in the economy over the last five years.

While there are ample jobs that are being created in the economy across different sectors, a key area of concern that remains is regarding the skills of those who are entering the labour force. While the government has ensured that there is ample labour demand, what needs to be done now is to ensure that there is a significant push towards augmentation of labour supply through successive skilling and reskilling endeavours. Some amount of policy push has already been given towards skill development and perhaps, in subsequent years we will witness a far more robust and dynamic labour market in India than ever before.

Now that we have multiple sources of jobs, it is important to look at all these sources before we conclude the state of employment in the country. It is evident that apart from CMIE, which is a true sense of outlier for reasons best known to them, all other sources categorically demonstrate that there is robust job creation in the economy. This doesn‚Äôt come as a surprise as the government has ramped up public infrastructure projects which have a significant multiplier effect in terms of job creation in the economy. Through these multiple sources of data, we can safely establish that in terms of job creation the last five years have been exceptionally been good and any further debate around jobs would be driven by political considerations rather than all available empirical evidence."
150,"With the Jaipur rally, Rahul Gandhi, and his gaffes, are back","Amidst the recent formulated ‚Äòprotests‚Äô over CAA, NRC and NPR tension brewing in the country, Rahul Gandhi is back to provide his fans with some comic relief, bringing laughter and joy into the long series of incessant lies and baseless accusations, most of which, interestingly, also come from himself.

The senior Congress leader was in Jaipur, Rajasthan on January 28 to launch a ‚Äòserious‚Äô campaign to tap so-called ‚Äòyouth anger‚Äô against the central government in wake of CAA and NRC and the so-called highhandedness in dealing with student protests in university campuses particularly in JNU, Jamia Milia Islamia and AMU.

Addressing the youth of the country at the ‚ÄòAkrosh Rally‚Äô in Jaipur, Rajasthan, the prince of goof-ups, merely 2.04 minutes into his power-packed speech, said: ‚ÄúHindustan ka yuva berojgaari ke sapne dekhta hai‚Äù roughly translated as ‚ÄúThe youth of the country dreams of unemployment‚Äù, while inadvertently also admitting that the Modi government is breaking the dreams of the youth.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

People are left to wonder here whether he actually intended to speak against the Modi government or in their favour?

[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zY5M3jKUwtU]

Rahul Gandhi, in the beginning of his speech, with all conviction, asserted: ‚ÄúHindustan ya yuva sirf Hindustan nahin desh badal sakta hai‚Äù (India‚Äôs youth can not only change India but also the country). Here, ‚ÄòIndia‚Äô and the ‚Äòcountry‚Äô would have technically meant the same thing.

Though the Congress leader quickly corrected himself at this point by replacing ‚Äòdesh‚Äô (country) with ‚Äòduniya‚Äô (world), which actually made some sense, he did not think it important to rectify his ‚ÄúHindustan ka yuva berojgaari ke sapne dekhta hain‚Äù gaffe.

The list of gaffes committed by Rahul Gandhi is endless. Addressing an election rally in Jharkhand, last December, the Gandhi scion conjured up a new mathematical numeral-‚ÄòDhai Hazaar Panch Sau‚Äô ( Rs 2500 500). It is interesting to note that initially he had said the correct figure, two thousand five hundred, but being himself, he invented the new number just a moment later.

Read: Rahul Gandhi: Mad(e) in India

This is not the first time that the former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has regaled his audience and listeners with his unintended humour. Last year, Rahul Gandhi invented another numeral-‚Äúpichatees‚Äù while slamming the BJP government for the rising unemployment figures.

The list of Rahul Gandhi‚Äôs problems with numbers is endless. During the 2019 Lok Sabha election campaigns, the then Congress president had given different numbers about their promised NYAY scheme at different rallies. Although the proposal had promised ‚Çπ72,000 per year, Rahul Gandhi had promised ‚Çπ72,000 per month in one place, while had promised a whopping ‚Çπ72,000 crore per year in another place.

Rahul‚Äôs goof-ups are legendary. From ‚Äúthis morning when I got up in the night‚Äù to his scientific fantasies of Alu Sona machine, the Congress prince is a constant source of entertainment and laughter for the public."

However, a deeper analysis shows that this perception of poor job creation under NDA tenure may be false.

Concerns of poor job data by former NITI Aayog chief

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

Former NITI Aayog chief Arvind Panagariya had remarked that job data in India is not accurate in an interview to Hindustan Times. This is because the labour bureau data on jobs, which is collected every three months covers only those firms which have more than 10 employees. Jobs created in informal sector are not covered. He also said that a more accurate source for job data , the NSSO household survey (Employment and Unemployment Survey) ,is collected once in five years. This makes it difficult for the government to assess real numbers of jobs created or lost in the economy.

Existing surveys to measure employment are misleading

In a study titled ‚ÄòTowards a Payroll Reporting in India‚Äô, conducted by Pulak Ghosh (Professor IIM, Bangalore) and Dr. Soumya Kanti Ghosh, (Group Chief Economic Adviser, SBI) have tried to address the poor jobs data scenario in India‚Äôs formal sector. They call the existing surveys to measure employment as ‚Äòmost misleading‚Äô in their report. The reasons cited for this remark are (emphasis added) :

Information was sought from around 11,179 units as a representative sample for 8 sectors at all India level.

Number of non-respondent not disclosed in the Survey

The survey result comes with a huge lag. In the Dec‚Äô17 month Labour Bureau has published employment situation as of Mar‚Äô17

This is primarily an establishment survey for collecting information on employment in the unit; therefore, it does not provide any information on unemployment in the country

The survey is based on either record or response of the unit. However, verification of record has not been resorted to for collection of data

The Collection of Statistics Act-2008, is not applied to QES. Hence, all the information provided by the selected unit/ establishment is on a voluntary basis

The Scope of QES is limited to all establishments having 10 or more workers and the scope & coverage is further limited to employment in Non-farm Industrial economy covering 8 selected sectors (vis-√†-vis universe of 190 industries)

A better method for collecting employment data

The researchers have studied payroll data generated for new employees ( in the age group of 18 to 25) in formal sector for the financial year 2017-18. They have got the raw data for the study from ESIC (Employees‚Äô State Insurance Corporation), NPS (National Pension Scheme) and GPF (Government Provident Fund) to understand the real scenario of jobs in the country. The main findings of their study is captured in two graphs.

Graph 1

Graph 1 is a compilation of the total number of payrolls generated for new employees in the age group of 18-25. This is more reliable than the labour bureau data as there is a confirmation of the employee numbers because of the social security payment records for the entire workforce in formal sector.

Graph 2

Graph 2 captures the data of EPFO (till November ‚Äô17 ) ESIC (till September ‚Äô17 ) NPS (till October‚Äô17). It finds out the number of new employees on the payroll tIll the end of these months and estimates the number of jobs that may be added to the economy by the end of fiscal year.

7 million new jobs in 2017-18 is a conservative estimate

While commenting on these two graphs researchers say that the study is the first such study on payroll situation in India. They also remark that it is a conservative estimate and inclusion of data from other professional bodies could show a higher number of jobs in the economy. They suggest that the job scenario could be properly understood if EPFO, ESIC & NPS in collaboration publish a monthly report of new payrolls in India . They suggest big data analyses to capture payrolls generated in informal sector as well.

Thus the myth of poor job creation under the Narendra Modi government could turn out to be false. If a similar study is done for previous fiscals, the number of jobs generated so far under the NDA government might end up higher than those posted by the labour bureau data. A better method for capturing job data needs to be set up by the government to capture the scenario at ground level to debunk false perceptions created by the media and opposition"
152,"76.48 lakh jobs created in last 17 months, 8.96 lakh jobs in January alone: EFPO payroll data","According to the latest payroll data released by the Employment Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO), the net employment generation in the formal sector shot up to a 17-month high reaching 8.96 lakh jobs in the month of January. The EPFO has been releasing the payroll data since April 2018 covering the period starting September 2017. The number of EPFO subscribers was 131 per cent high in January 2019 as compared to January 2018 when only 3.87 lakh EPFO subscribers were added.

According to the data, a total of 2,75,609 jobs were created in September 2017 and about 76.48 lakh new subscribers were added to social security schemes of the EPFO between September 2017 to January 2019. The payroll data had witnessed a slight decline (1.8%) in December 2018 stopping at 7.03 lakh as compared to the estimate of 7.16 lakh released the previous month. For the period between September 2017-December 2018, the EPFO revised the cumulative job addition data downwards 6.6 percent to 67.52 lakh as against the forecast of 72.32 lakh.

Being the closing month of the financial year, March 2018 experienced the sharpest decline with 29,023 members exiting the EPFO subscription contrary to last month‚Äôs estimated addition of 5,498 members. During January 2019, the highest number of jobs were created in the 22-25 year age group which was 2.44 lakh jobs. This was followed by 2.24 lakh jobs in the 18-21 year age bracket.

According to the EPFO, the data of the exited members is based on the individual claims and establishments and the data uploaded by the employers whereas the data of new subscribers is based on the Universal Account Number (UAN) generated in the system and those having received a non-zero subscription.

The EPFO data is provisional as the employee records are updated as a regular process and the same gets updated in subsequent months."
153,"MSME sector created around 1.5 crore jobs each year in last 4 years, CII finds in its latest survey","Amid all the claims of jobless growth during the term of Modi government, a survey conducted by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) has found an increase of 13.9% in net job creations in the MSME sector over the last four years. In the largest ever survey specific to Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises, over one lakh firms of various sizes were included across various sectors and geographies.

CII is India‚Äôs premier business organisation, it is a non-government, not-for-profit, industry-led and industry-managed body. It has over 9,000 members, and indirect membership of over 3,00,000 enterprises through around 265 national and regional sectoral industry bodies.

‚ÄúThe survey establishes a growth of 3.3 per cent (compounded growth rate) per annum. When mapped to the macro level data sourced from Labour Bureau, this works out to an estimated additional job creation to the tune of 13.5 to 14.9 million per annum‚Äù, said Mr Rakesh Bharti Mittal, President of CII. The total strength of labour forces is estimated at about 45 crore in the year 2017-18 using data from labour bureau.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

According to the survey, Hospitality & Tourism was the top job generating sector, followed by Textiles & Apparel, Metal Products, Machinery Parts and Transport & Logistic. ‚ÄúThe survey also reveals that the Micro enterprises were the largest job creators in the past four years and will continue to be so in the next three years‚Äù CII Director General Mr Chandrajit Banerjee said.

The survey indicates the higher growth on employment generation will continue for next two-three years. It is expected that government initiatives like the 2 per cent interest rate subvention given to all MSMEs and Trade Receivable e-Discounting System (TReDS) implemented recently would drive future growth leading to more employment. ‚ÄúHowever, the CII survey highlights the need for greater hand-holding of the MSMEs who are still to take full advantage of these Government initiatives,‚Äù said Mr Banerjee.

The survey by CII shows that a majority of enterprises were able to fill vacancies under a month, indicating higher availability of skilled manpower. ‚ÄúThe survey has indeed thrown up the most promising outcomes. There is a very healthy growth in employment among the MSME segment of industry and with the kind of disruptions and innovations that are likely to sweep through industry in terms of new technologies and practices, our skills development front is also undergoing rapid changes,‚Äù said the CII President.

CII conducted the survey in about n350 industrial locations in 28 states in India, and covered 105,347 MSMEs. The survey included queries on jobs creation, ease of filling up vacancies, impact of Government initiatives on jobs creation by the MSMEs."
154,"CMIE, that has ties to P Chidambaram and fear-mongered about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô was a part of Congress Manifesto Committee","The Congress party released its 2019 Lok Sabha Election Manifesto with much fanfare on Tuesday, the 2nd of April 2019. The manifesto had several rather dangerous aspects to it. Apart from accusing the Indian Army of sexual violence and torture in Kashmir, the Congress promised to dilute AFSPA, curtail the power of the Media and make the NSA accountable to all politicians, thereby running the risk of making public sensitive national security concerns.

Heading the Manifesto committee was senior Congress leader P Chidambaram. Interestingly, according to a report in the Times of India, the following were the ‚Äúpolicy wonks‚Äù who helped formulate the Congress manifesto.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

An interesting name that is included in the list, is that of Mr Mahesh Vyas, CEO of CMIE. Multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year. However, CMIE decided to present shoddy data to claim that unemployment was at its highest.

Interestingly, the CEO is CMIE, it has now been revealed, was helping Congress build their manifesto.

CMIE has a long and interesting history and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram who was the head of the Manifesto committee in which Mahesh Vyas was also involved.

CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey, is wholly owned by Mr Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam.

Mr Shah has been accused of accessing data from NSE on a preferential basis in connivance with the authorities and sharing this data with certain stockbrokers for use in High-Frequency Trading. The scam is being investigated by SEBI, CBI as well as by Income Tax authorities.

The current MD of CMIE is Mr Mahesh Vyas, who happens to be the brother-in-law of Mr Ajay Shah. The timing of the commencement of this Job Survey raises suspicion on the motivation as well as the credibility of the data. The co-location scam came to public light in late 2015, and the first Job Survey was out in April 2016.

Several of the news articles (as well as Wikipedia entry on NSE Co-location scam at the time of writing this article) mentions that Mr Ajay Shah is a very close confidante of Mr P. Chidambaram. Given this information and the ownership pattern of CMIE, any ‚ÄòJob Survey‚Äô from CMIE should be taken with a pinch (or a tonne) of salt, as one would take it from a Congress IT cell.

The entire story of the close association between CMIE and P Chidambaram and also the improprieties attached its key players can be read here.

The information at hand begs a few important questions:

1. Since the owners of CMIE are accused of impropriety, was it appropriate to get Mahesh Vyas involved in the Manifesto committee?

Reportedly, RK Sharma, secretary-general of FIMI said, in 2011-12 the mining sector employed 23.23 lakh people and due to various judgments, including bans and restrictions on mining placed by the Supreme Court, there was a significant drop in employment in the mining sector.

Sharma further added that due to bans and restrictions imposed by the court, around 80,000 direct employee lost their jobs in Karnataka. According to him, the number of job losses due to SC intervention was higher in Goa numbering nearly one lakh. Addition to that, the huge penalties imposed by the apex court in 2017 on 102 iron and manganese ore leases in Odisha has also led to around 50,000 direct job loss.

On the pretext of illegal mining, in 2011, the Supreme Court had banned mining in 188 leases in Karnataka. Subsequently, it allowed mining in 115 leases. However, in 2012, the Supreme Court had suspended all mining leases in Goa, but in 2014 granted renewals of leases with an annual production cap of 20 million tonnes. However, with effect from March last year, it cancelled the renewal of 88 mining, putting a blanket ban on the mining operation in the state.

‚ÄúThe closure or limitation of production has crippled the mining industry and adversely impacted both direct and indirect employment. Many mines are finding it difficult to operate and closing down one by one, further creating a slump and increasing the unemployment rate in remote and tribal regions,‚Äù Sharma added.

The mining sector is the third-largest in terms of generating job per unit increase in the sectoral GDP with an employment elasticity of 0.52%, next only to construction and finance & real estate. This implies that for every 1% growth in the mining sector‚Äôs GDP, employment in the sector increases by 0.52%.

Reportedly, nearly 2,60,000 people are in danger of job loss, direct and indirect, because of the lapsing of merchant mines by March next year. The validity 329 mining leases will end by March 31, causing job losses for 2,64,000. On the list of the lapsing mines are 48 operative leases, whose shutdown will lead to a deficit of around 60 million tonnes (mt) in raw material suppliers, mainly iron ore.

Recently, distinguished lawyer Harish Salve had also blamed the Supreme Court of India for the economic slowdown the country is currently experiencing. In an interview, Salve held the apex court responsible for the slump in the economy stating that the slowdown was triggered by the court‚Äôs verdict in the 2G spectrum case in 2012.

Salve had asserted that the top court‚Äôs order on 2G and coal allocation triggered foreign investors to exit from the Indian markets. In 2012, the Supreme Court had invalidated the 122 spectrum licences granted to eight companies. Salve contended that a blanket cancellation of allocation that happened in accordance with the rules set by the then government had a negative impact on the foreign investors who had to bear the brunt of the malfeasance of government authorities."
156,Did Congress President Rahul Gandhi just admit that UPA failed to generate jobs?,"Days after advocating ISIS Rojgar Yojana, where he equated ISIS terrorists to ‚Äòpoor unemployed youth‚Äô, he has now upped his game. He has claimed that the reason people like Prime Minister Modi and US President Donald Trump got votes is because people were angry due to unemployment and had much expectations from them. Interacting with Indian Journalists‚Äô Association in London, the Congress President said that people support Modi and Trump because they are ‚Äòangry because they don‚Äôt have a job‚Äô.

For someone who aspires to be Prime Minister of India in 2019, Rahul Gandhi needs a refresher course. For ten years before Modi got elected, the UPA led by Congress, where his mother Sonia Gandhi is the chairperson, was in power. That senior Congress leader Dr. Manmohan Singh was the Prime Minister. So essentially, if what he is saying about people voting for Modi and Trump because they are angry due to unemployment, it is probably because UPA failed to generate jobs.

This statement of his came a days after he embarrassed himself on an international platform by admitting his ignorance on Doklam issue, while constantly criticising and questioning the government on the same on all forums.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

This is not the first time Congress‚Äô Prime Ministerial candidate has made a self goal. Earlier, in a bid to attack the PM earlier, Gandhi had inadvertently implied that the Nirav Modi-PNB scam was approved by Congress in 2011 when the UPA was in power. In January this year, to appear ‚Äòwoke‚Äô on rising inequality, Gandhi ended up sharing an article which had damning indictment of UPA rule itself."

Trying once again to pull PM Narendra Modi for allegedly outpacing BJP veteran leader LK Advani in 2014, Rahul said that the ‚Äúboxer‚Äù Prime Minister was ‚Äúsupposed to fight unemployment, farmer problems, corruption etc but he instead turned around and punched his coach Advani ji in his face, his team Gadkari ji Jaitley ji, then went into crowd and punched small traders and farmers.‚Äù

Interestingly, in his hurry to insult the Prime Minister, Rahul Gandhi ended up admitting to his party‚Äôs mess that was inherited by the Modi government.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

The Congress president‚Äôs flippant attempt to mock Modi sounded more like submission of his own party‚Äôs past shortcoming. What could be understood from Rahul‚Äôs statement is that when PM Modi came to power in 2014, he had to undertake several problems like unemployment, corruption, farmers issues, which were left unattended by the outbound Congress government.

Rahul Gandhi accidentally throws light on the adverse conditions the Congress party had left the country in before Modi picked up the reins in his hands.

This is not the first time Rahul has used this vile jibe to denounce the PM. Earlier too, while addressing a rally in Maharashtra, Gandhi attacked PM Modi making a veiled reference to allotting of the Gandhinagar seat, which traditionally belonged to senior BJP leader L K Advani, to BJP President Amit Shah for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Rahul Gandhi said that Narendra Modi hit senior BJP leader L K Advani with shoes and pushed him off the stage.

If this was not disgraceful enough, Rahul was seen repeating the same disgraceful remark the very next day in his Hardiwar rally on April 6.

To put things in perspective, L K Advani, born on November 8, 1927, is 91 years old. In the last five years, he has hardly been involved in active politics. It is only natural for people to retire after decades of active public life and make way for newer faces and leaders."
158,"Under the Modi government, Northeast India has witnessed many ‚Äòfirsts‚Äô","‚ÄúWe are committed to making the Northeast an engine of India‚Äôs growth story‚Äù: PM Modi.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi while inaugurating the first-ever airport of Sikkim in Pakyong on 24th September reiterated his commitment towards the development of Northeast India. Modi has maintained that ‚ÄòIndia‚Äôs growth story will get speed only when there is an all-round development of the Northeast and its people‚Äô.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

While addressing the people of Sikkim, PM Modi stated that with Sikkim getting its first ever airport, India has managed to get 1000 airports operational out of which 35 airports can be attributed to the BJP government since they have been developed in the last 4 years.

BJP until the recent victory in state elections in Tripura, Nagaland and Meghalaya which was a landmark for the party, had very little traction in the region except in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. The party was even seen as an outsider until PM Modi‚Äôs ‚ÄòAct East‚Äô policy changed the situation.

As part of this policy, the NDA government has been focusing on reducing the isolation of the region by improving all-around connectivity through road, rail, telecom, power and waterways sectors.

This year, as a part of the government‚Äôs vision, to see Northeast India on top of the development chart, solar toilets were installed at Ibudhou Marjing hill Heingang of Manipur, making Manipur the first state in North-East and third in India to have solar toilets.

Last year while addressing a meeting after inaugurating a 60-MW Tuirial hydropower project, Modi had announced that Mizoram had become the third power-surplus state in the North-East after Sikkim and Tripura. Modi had then proudly said ‚ÄúThe completion of this project is a reflection of our commitment to completing ongoing projects and ushering in a new era of development in the North-East.

The Tuirial project, which was announced and cleared in 1998 by the then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, was the first major central project to be successfully commissioned in Mizoram.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year also inaugurated India‚Äôs longest bridge, the Dhola-Sadia bridge, spanning 9.3 km across the Brahmaputra, taking infrastructure development in the region forward by several steps.

The road bridge, connecting Dhola in Arunachal Pradesh to Sadiya in Assam, has been built at a cost of Rs2,056 crore by the ministry of road transport and highways.

PM Narendra Modi had in 2016 inaugurated a petrochemical project in Dibrugarh in Assam, a first-ever such project in the northeast. The project is India‚Äôs highest wax producing unit using indigenous technology.

In its quest to intensify the development of Northeastern regions, the government currently is also making a heavy investment in power transmission projects covering all the eight North Eastern states at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore.

Under the supervision of Modi government, railways have undertaken a major expansion in the region at a cost of around Rs 10,000 crore. In November 2014, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya were put up on the railway map for the first time. Agartala in Tripura has also been connected with broad gauge line.

In the North East, the Indian Railways has commissioned about 900 kilometres of Broad Gauge in the last two years and in addition to this 132 kilometre part of third alternative connectivity route to North East (that is New Maynaguri ‚Äì Jogighopa) has also been commissioned. The Indian Railways had announced in May that it plans to invest a further Rs 40,000 crores in the Northeastern states for infrastructure development and connectivity.

Modi government concerned about the staggering unemployment rate encompassing Northeast regions have established two important projects in Assam ‚Äì Brahmaputra Cracker and Polymer Limited and Numaligarh Refinery Limited‚Äôs wax unit, which would create huge job opportunities for people in the northeast.

In its first, the Modi government implemented an improved internet connectivity project for the North East region in collaboration with Bangladesh, which will make 10 GB of seamless alternate bandwidth available for the region.

Connectivity, economic growth, tourism and enabling the locals to find better opportunities in employment has been the focus of the government. In August this year, the NDA government passed the bill for India‚Äôs first ever sports university to be built in Manipur.

Apart from these developments, the government believing and working towards achieving PMs vision making ‚ÄòNortheast an engine of India‚Äôs growth story‚Äô, has been relentlessly working in other spheres as well which includes Tourism, Development of rural areas, setting up of BPO industry, organic farming etc.

Recently in the fourth summit of BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) which was held at Nepal capital Kathmandu on 30th and 31th August 2018, Prime Minister, re-emphasised the importance to Northeastern India and stressed on his priority to develop the region."
159,The IT-industry shows a 38% rise in job creation since last year: Report,"According to latest reports, the IT industry has shown continuous growth in the recruitment landscape over the past six months, recording a rise of 38 percent growth surpassing the 12 percent national average hike in hirings on a year-on-year basis from March 2018, says Naukri JobSpeak report.

The Naukri JobSpeak Index for March 2019, stood at 2,378, which is 12 percent higher in hiring activities from March 2018, which stood at 2,129. Also among all the major metro cities, Bangaluru topped the list, as it contributed 18 percent of the total recruitments.

The report reveals that industries such as IT Software, IT Hardware, BPO/ITES, FMCG have witnessed an increase in hirings in March 2019 compared to March 2018. While the IT-industry has been recording an increase from 32 percent to 38 percent, Construction and Engineering saw an increase of 13 percent, BPO/ITES by 9 percent, FMCG by 5 percent, Education by 7 percent and IT-Hardware by 3 percent.

InfoEdge India CMO Sumeet Singh said, ‚ÄúThe JobSpeak index continues with its positive growth in hiring with a 12 percent rise when compared to the same period last year. Our latest hiring outlook survey showed 89 percent recruiters from the IT industry stating that new jobs and replacement hiring will play a strong role in hiring. Hopefully, the momentum will be sustained in the coming months.‚Äù

The Naukri JobSpeak is a monthly Index which calculates and records hiring activity based on the job listings on Naukri.com website month on month.

Further, the report revealed that the demand for mid-level executives, in the experienced band of 4-7 years, grew by 14 percent whereas recruitment for entry-level jobs, with an experienced band of 0-3 years, witnessed a rise of 12 percent.

Naukri.com, one of India‚Äôs premier job portals, had also published the findings of its Hiring Outlook survey which depicted a very bright scenario for employment opportunities in the country between January to June 2019.

Earlier too, despite much brouhaha created by the Congress over job creation, multiple sources have reiterated that around 15 million jobs were created in India by the Modi government per year.

In fact, it was also disclosed lately that CMIE, that brings out periodic Job Survey and which was instrumental in fear-mongering about ‚Äòunemployment in India‚Äô has a long and interesting history as it is wholly owned by Mr. Ajay Shah (and his family), the same person who also happens to be one of the main accused in a mega scam commonly known as ‚ÄòNSE Co-location‚Äô scam and is closely linked with Congress minister P Chidambaram."

While there is nothing factually wrong in these reports, the real mischief lies in what these reports don‚Äôt tell you.

- article continues after ad - - article resumes -

What the reports don‚Äôt clarify:

The increase in debt is perfectly normal, in fact, India is doing better than many major economies on this parameter

The central government borrows money (from internal and external sources) to fund the fiscal deficit. Govt debt is nothing but an accumulation of fiscal deficits over the years. Government debt over the years has always increased. The important factor here is the sustainability of the debt, and the most important parameter to evaluate sustainability is the Debt to GDP ratio (because as the GDP increases, govt‚Äôs revenue increases and thus its ability to service debt enhances). In India‚Äôs case, the Central government debt to GDP ratio has been hovering around 44-47% since 2010 and has shown improvement under the Modi government.

The above chart shows that the ratio has improved from 46.98% in 2013 to 45.11% in 2017. Similarly, the gross general government debt, which includes borrowings of both Central and State governments has hovered between 67-72% since 2010 and is expected to steadily decline until 2024.

Finance ministry, in a recent press release, commented on the government debt ‚Äì

The overall liabilities of the Central Government are on a medium-term declining trajectory and Government‚Äôs Debt Portfolio is characterised by prudent risk profile. Government is primarily resorting to market-linked borrowings for financing its fiscal deficit. Conventional indicators of Debt sustainability, i.e., Debt/GDP ratio, interest payment to revenue receipts, shares of short-term Debt/External Debt/FRBs in total debt indicate that the debt profile of the Government is comfortably placed in terms of debt sustainability parameters and is consistently improving.

Under UPA, central government debt increased at a much higher rate

While all reports and tweets by opposition leaders harped on the 49% increase in central government debt under Modi government, they conveniently forgot to compare it with what happened during UPA government. OpIndia analysis shows that the central government debt increased by 68% under UPA-I and 89% under UPA-II. Cumulatively, the debt more than tripled in 10 years of UPA. But why show the complete picture when half of it helps your propaganda?

When it comes to external debt (borrowings from foreign governments and institutions), the figure saw an increase of 443% under UPA-I, 60% under UPA-II and 0.04% under the Modi government. This underscores the statement from the Finance Ministry that the government is primarily resorting to market-linked borrowings to finance the fiscal deficit.

Thus, the number 49% is more hype and less substance. But it‚Äôs election season, so expect much more misleading news based on half-truths."

India's current unemployment rate stands at 7.5 per cent as per Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). However, the unemployment rate for graduates stands at 18.5 per cent - more than twice the headline rate, according to data for the end of 2019 compiled by CMIE.

The latest findings from the survey conducted by Centre For Monitoring Indian Economy for the period between September and December 2019 has been done after interacting with 1.74 lakh households.

The report depicts a substantial increase in unemployment rate in urban India, which stands at 9 percent compared to unemployment rate in rural India at 6.8 per cent.

The overall unemployment rate for females is at 17.5 per cent versus 6.2 per cent for males. In a more drastic increase, the unemployment rate is as high as 26 per cent for urban females.

Mahesh Vyas, CEO, Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV, ""India's headline unemployment rate is at 7.5 per cent but, this understates the real problem on hand which is of lack of sufficient jobs for young graduates.""

""Nearly one in every four graduates in the mid- to late-twenties who is looking for a job is unable to find a job.""

NSO's leaked report last year for financial year 2018-19 suggested unemployment was at its highest in 45 years."
163,Unemployment Rate Among Indian Women More Than Double Of Men: Study,"A study found that unemployment rate among Indian women more than double of men

The unemployment rate among women in India is more than double of that of men with similar qualifications, a new study has revealed. Titled ""Gender Inclusion in Hiring in India"", the study by two Harvard students, Rachel Levenson and Layla O'Kane, noted that 8.7 per cent of working-age urban, educated women in the country are unemployed but only 4 per cent of comparable men find themselves without a job.

""While there are many factors that influence a woman's decision and ability to find work, the gender gap in the unemployment rate along with ILO (International Labour Organisation) research suggest that women, particularly highly-educated ones, face additional barriers as compared to men in accessing jobs,"" it said.

Levenson and O'Kane's analysis is based on close to 200 India-based jobs for which Shortlist, a hiring firm in India, had provided the recruiting platform between 2016 and 2017. It included 286,991 applications from 211,004 applicants (some people applied to multiple jobs).

According to the study, while discrimination based on gender is illegal under the Indian constitution, conversations with hiring managers and other labour market experts have revealed that there is gender discrimination in the hiring process across the country, as is the case around the world.

The study looks at three stages at which women may face barriers during hiring -- qualifications and experience, recruitment and choice to apply, and application process, while suggesting tools to increase gender diversity in the Indian workforce.

It highlighted the need for gender inclusive work places by correlating it with ""higher levels of performance and innovation"".

""Inclusive hiring improves firm-level growth by allowing companies to attract and retain top talent and better serving consumers in markets or sectors where women are a key customer segment,"" it said.

The study also noted that increasing female participation in the labour force could increase the Indian GDP by 27 per cent.

Not dismissing the progress, albeit little, that several multinational corporations in the country have made towards minimising gender discrimination at work place over the past couple of decades, it highlighted the role technology could play in improving hiring outcomes including increasing the number of women who apply and get shortlisted for jobs.

""We know that diverse teams perform better, and we're encouraged by these results because they show that even small and medium sized businesses, and not just large enterprises, can leverage technology to increase the diversity of their candidate pools,"" said Simon Desjardins, Co-founder of Shortlist.

The study suggested competency-based assessments, behavioral nudges in recruitment, and well-designed job descriptions, for creating a more effective bias-reducing, gender-sensitive hiring process in India.

164,"Provident Fund Enrolment, Tax Data Can't Measure Jobs: Think Tank Chief","Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct, says Mahesh Vyas (File)

Amid the controversy over the withholding of a report on the country's unemployment situation, the government has cited data from provident fund records, Income Tax filings and the National Pension System (NPS), besides a possible upswing in the informal sector to show generation of crores of new jobs.

However, this does not mean there is an increase in jobs, the chief of the think tank that claimed last month 11 million jobs were lost in 2018 in an alarming report, has said.

During his reply on the motion of thanks on the President's address in the Lok Sabha on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said new jobs were created in the unorganised sector, which accounts for 80-85 per cent employment, citing an increase in the sale of commercial vehicles, infrastructure building and housing activities.

He said about 1.8 crore people had enrolled in the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) in the past 15 months, and 64 per cent of them, who were below the age of 28 were first-time employees.

PM Modi also cited the data showing increase in the registration of employees under the National Pension Scheme (NPS) from 65 lakh in March 2014 to 1.2 crore till October 2018.

Considering the EPF enrolments as a reflector of job creation is not correct as it can be formalisation of informal jobs, said Mahesh Vyas, Chief Executive Officer of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), a think tank.

""When a person enrols for the EPF, it does not necessarily mean that the person has got a job. It is quite likely that you have enrolled for the EPF for the first time though you had a job for a long time,"" he said.

""The law requires an employer with 20 people or more to register with the EPFO. If a firm has got 19 employees till yesterday and today 20th person joins in, then all 20 get enrolled for the first time. So it looks like employment has gone up by 20 when actually it is one.""

Another expert, who did not wish to be named, said there cannot be a correlation between EPF enrolment and job creation ""since it has so many moving parts and variables, so one could interpret it differently"".

PM Modi also had said that new 6.35 lakh new non-corporate tax payers such as doctors must have provided jobs in past four years. The expert called it ""incomprehensible"" in the absence of the source of the data.

In his speech, the PM said he expected over 1.25 crore people have got jobs in the transport sector with the sale of 36 lakh commercial vehicles and 27 lakh auto-rickshaws.

He also cited setting up of two lakh service call centres, infrastructure building, hotel constructions and housing activities for the creation of employment in the country.

Mr Vyas said if a farmer takes up a labourer's job or moves to driving a truck, it cannot be considered a new job.

According to the CMIE statistics, India's unemployment rate shot up to 7.4 per cent in December, 2018 and the number of unemployed increased by a substantial 11 million - the highest in 15 months.

PM Modi had taken a dig at the past governments for failing to establish standard system to tally employment and said only 7-8 sectors were taken into account to arrive at the employment rate when, in reality, jobs were created in 100-odd sectors.

Mr Vyas said PM Modi was possibly referring to enterprise survey conducted by the Labour Ministry, which is one of the ways to estimate employment.

""That is not the best way to estimate employment and unemployment in country like India. But what the Prime Minister did not mention was that India also conducted a large house-hold survey. It is the most appropriate way of computing it and will capture all sectors. He is partially right but selective in the kind of survey done,"" he said.

""The traditional way, which is a good way of calculating employment and unemployment, is the NSSO household survey,"" he added.

The National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) report, which the government has withheld, said the unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, post-demonetisation and was at its highest level since 1972-73 - the period since when the jobs data is comparable."

Survey at centre of row over quitting of 2 members of statistical body

Here is your 10-point cheat sheet to this big story:

According to the report, which has not been made public but has been accessed by Business Standard, the unemployment rate was at its highest level since 1972-73. The report says in 2011-12, the unemployment rate stood at 2.2 per cent and youth unemployment is at ""astronomically high"" levels of 13 to 27 per cent. Joblessness was higher in urban areas (7.8 per cent) than in the rural areas (5.3 per cent). More people are withdrawing from the workforce as the labour force participation rate is lower than in the previous years. The NSSO's annual household survey of 2017-18 is the first after the November 2016 demonetisation, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared an overnight ban on high-value notes. The report is at the core of a controversy over the quitting of two members of the National Statistical Commission, including its acting chairman PC Mohanan. PC Mohanan confirmed that one of the reasons why he quit was the delay in the release of the National Sample Survey Office's Periodic Labour Force Survey report. PC Mohanan told NDTV that he and JV Meenakshi, the only non-government members of the statistics body, felt sidelined and ""not taken seriously"". The government today said the ""timing and verification has to be done"". It added: ""We have our process and we have explained to the members.""

The country's unemployment rate was at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, according to the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO's) periodic labour force survey (PLFS), which has been accessed by the Business Standard newspaper. The report was not released despite being vetted by the National Statistical Commission in December, allege two non-independent members who quit the data collating body on Tuesday. The government said today: ""We have explained to the members that decision to release the report will be ours. We will decide when this should happen."" The report, revealed just a day before the government's interim Budget, sets up a huge controversy just before the national election, due by May, with the opposition targeting the government on jobs data."
166,"Railways Had 63,000 Job Openings. 19 Million People Applied","Railways Jobs: The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum (AFP)

Anil Gujjar arrived in the national capital from a small village in Rajasthan carrying nothing except a backpack and hopes of finding a good job.

The odds were not in his favor. In February, the Indian railways announced a national recruitment drive for the most menial positions in its hierarchy - helper, porter, cleaner, gateman, track maintainer, assistant switchman.

It attracted 19 million applicants for 63,000 vacancies.

Gujjar, the son of a farmer and the first person in his family to attend college, was one of them. At the test center in Delhi where he took a mandatory exam in November, he looked around warily at hundreds of young men like him. Nearly all were college students or graduates. Some even had master's degrees.

Indian Railways Jobs: Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016 (AFP)

The railways recruitment effort is a potent symbol of India's employment conundrum. The country is one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world, but it is not generating enough jobs - let alone good jobs - for the increasingly educated young people entering the labor force.

By 2021, the number of people in the country between the ages of 15 and 34 is expected to reach 480 million. They have higher levels of literacy and are staying in school longer than any previous generation of Indians. The youth surge represents an opportunity for the country of 1.3 billion, economists say, but only if such young people can find productive work.

Recent employment trends are not encouraging. An analysis of government data by Azim Premji University showed that unemployment rose in nearly all states between 2011 and 2016. Jobless rates for young people and those with higher educational qualifications increased during the same period, in some cases sharply: The unemployment rate for college graduates jumped from 4.1 percent to 8.4 percent, according to Santosh Mehrotra, a well-known labor economist.

The fate of millions of job-seekers represents a major political liability for Prime Minister Narendra Modi as he seeks reelection this year. PM Modi came to power almost five years ago promising ""development for all"" and robust job creation. But his attempts to increase manufacturing and entrepreneurship have not succeeded in turbocharging employment.

Economic growth created fewer jobs in recent years (WP)

Meanwhile, PM Modi's controversial move in late 2016 to invalidate most of the bank notes - ostensibly to stem corruption - had a deleterious impact on workers. About 3 million jobs were lost in the first four months of 2017, according to the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a research firm in Mumbai that conducts a national employment survey. Its data also showed that the labor force shrank between 2017 and 2018 - not a sign of a healthy job market.

""India is rapidly losing an opportunity,"" said Mahesh Vyas, the chief executive of the research firm. ""We're just arguing needlessly and endlessly rather than deploying all these young people coming into the labor market into productive work."" The result is a ""slow and insidious crisis,"" he said.

For many young people, finding a job is an all-consuming task. An entire industry has sprung up offering ""personality development"" classes - a combination of basic English, social skills and interview preparation advertised as improving employability. Job scams are common, with fraudsters preying on the aspirations of those seeking work.

Educated young men do not want to be ""pakora wallahs"" - people who make the quintessential fried snack - said Radhicka Kapoor, an economist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations. ""They want good, productive jobs, and they're going to wait it out until they in fact find these jobs.""

Jobs In Railways: Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry (Representational)

Ajit Ghose, an economist at the Institute for Human Development in Delhi, says that India needs to generate jobs not only for fresh entrants to the workforce - who number 6 million to 8 million a year, according to his estimate - but also for people, mostly women, who are working far less than they would be if they could get stable jobs that paid a decent wage. Ghose has calculated that India has at least 104 million such ""surplus"" workers.

That's a monumental challenge for any government - and one that the leadership is not meeting. Judging the Modi government's track record on job creation is complicated by the fact that it has not released any comprehensive nationwide employment data since 2016. The Labor and Statistics ministries have conducted more-recent employment surveys of households, but those results have not been made public.

""It's anybody's guess whether we'll see any employment statistics come out before the 2019 elections,"" said Amit Basole, an economist at Azim Premji University.

Arvind Panagariya, an economist who served under the current government as vice chair of its policy planning agency, argued that no real assessment of the employment situation is possible until new nationwide data is released by the Statistics Ministry. Meanwhile, he said, his sense was that concerns about job creation are ""overblown,"" given the country's high rates of economic growth.

For educated youths, searching for a job that meets their aspirations can feel like a marathon. At the test center in Delhi, waves of applicants for the railway positions arrived three times a day, each weekday, from September through mid-December - a scene replicated at hundreds of exam centers across the country.

The flow of test-takers was so large and consistent that it created its own miniature economy. One entrepreneur operated a makeshift storage locker out of a nearby parked truck. Since the applicants could not take anything inside the exam center, he kept backpacks and phones for a fee of Rs 50. A vendor sold tube socks and ear buds on the sidewalk.

The railway jobs on offer - sometimes referred to as Group D positions - are junior but offer security and a comparatively good salary. The starting pay is Rs 18,000 a month, plus there are perks such as free train travel.

The stories of the young men - and they were all men, with one exception, at a test center in Delhi over two days - are striking in their sameness. The applicants are mostly college students and college graduates from the northern states of Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan who are seeking a way out of the villages where they grew up. There are no jobs there, they said.

Gujjar arrived in Delhi for the first time in his life the evening before his 9 am exam. He spent the night sleeping on a sheet that he spread on the floor of the railway station. Early the next morning, he took a bus to the exam center, where he stood, waiting, in a thin striped sweater, arms crossed against the predawn chill. At 7:35 am, a guard carrying a portable loudspeaker began barking instructions to the assembled test-takers.

Too anxious for chitchat, Gujjar declined to describe how he felt at that moment. ""Ask me after I see the exam paper,"" he said. The posts at Indian Railways held no inherent appeal, he explained. ""It's not about interest,"" he said. ""I just want a job.""

Gujjar, 19, helps his parents farm a small plot of land where they grow wheat and millet. A year ago, he tried to join the Indian army, but he did not make the cut in a qualifying exam. There are no opportunities in his village in the district of Jhunjhunu, he said, and most of his friends do not have steady work.

After taking the 90-minute computerized test, Gujjar strode through a blue metal gate with a smile of relief on his face. The exam was not as difficult as he had feared. It will be months before he knows whether he has beaten the odds, which are roughly 1 in 300. ""If I get a job, it will be worth it,"" he said.

167,13 Million Jobs Created In 2017: Member Of Economic Advisory Council,"1.7 to 3 million jobs could have been created by the construction sector alone in FY18.

Twenty-two million jobs have been created during 2014-2017, with 13 million new jobs in 2017 alone, according to a report. Surjit Bhalla, a member of the Prime Minister's Economic Advisory Council (PMEAC) and the author of the report, says that the goals of the report are to gauge job creation in 2017 in the absence of a comprehensive public survey, and to predict how many new jobs are needed every year.

The report goes on to say that reforms under the current government, like the MUDRA scheme and the boost in road construction activity have pushed up employment. It goes on to claim that 1.7 to 3 million jobs could have been created by the construction sector alone in financial year 2017-18.

Mr. Bhalla rejected the common assumption that 10 to 12 million new jobs are needed annually in India, stating that these figures are dated and were last correct in 2004. According to the report, only 7.5 million new jobs were required in 2017 to maintain the unemployment percentage.

The report draws on two kinds of government surveys and a private survey for its analysis. The private survey, carried out by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) and the Bombay Stock Exchange, found that only 1.7 million new jobs were created in 2017, in contrast to the new report's figure of 13 million. Mr Bhalla has criticised this survey and claimed that there are ""mega inconsistencies"" in the CMIE survey.

The report also looks into the drop in women's labour force participation rate that has been reported by the CMIE. It states that half the drop in women's jobs is ""artificial"" as it has been caused by women pursuing education, and the the drop runs parallel to a similar drop in men's labour force participation rate. The reasons behind these drops are under study."
168,Unemployment Major Challenge For India: International Monetary Fund,"IMF said that the reforms being carried out for the past few years might help create jobs. (File)

Acknowledging that unemployment is a major challenge that India is facing currently, the IMF today exuded confidence that the reforms being carried out in India in the last few years would end up creating new jobs in the country.""Clearly India faces a challenge in terms of providing sufficient employment for a number of people looking for work and particularly young people. But yes, the measures and the reforms that India is undertaking will over medium term create jobs,"" International Monetary Fund spokesperson, Gerry Rice said.Noting that India has been one of the fastest growing large economies in recent times, he said this has led to improvement in reducing poverty and improvements in living standards.""Our view is that recent reforms, particularly the implementation of GST, national goods and services tax, should help boost efficiency and productivity and overtime will contribute to help them create jobs in the formal sector,"" Mr Rice said when asked if India is experiencing jobless growth.In addition, the government recently took steps towards labor market flexibility by modifying labor rules. ""We think that these reforms will help to increase employment, perhaps not overnight but over the medium term,"" he said.And the continuation of micro economic policies, structural forms including reforms in the labor market, will not only boosts India's long-term growth but create jobs as well, Mr Rice said.""So we think, all of this will help to spur India's continuing catch up with advanced economies and create many jobs that are needed to employ people who are going to labor force,"" Mr Rice said."
169,"Unemployment The Reason Why PM Modi, Donald Trump Were Voted To Power: Rahul Gandhi","Congress Vice President Rahul Gandhi interacted with students at Princeton University during his US visit

Leaders like Narendra Modi and Donald Trump are being elected all over the world because people are in pain due to unemployment, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi said today, but stressed that even the prime minister was not doing enough to solve the key problem facing India.Mr Gandhi, 47, who is in the US on a two-week-long tour, during his interaction with students at the prestigious Princeton University admitted that the Narendra Modi-led BJP came to power in India because people were angry with the Congress party over the issue of unemployment.Employment is an all-encompassing means to empower, enfranchise and involve Indians in the nation building process, he said.""I think, the central reason why Mr Modi arose and to an extent why Mr Trump came, is the question of jobs in India and in the United States. There's a large part of our populations that simply do not have jobs and cannot see a future. And, so they are feeling pain. And they have supported these types of leaders,"" Mr Gandhi told students.He said the another problem is that nobody was recognising that unemployment was a problem. ""I do not know (Donald) Trump. I don't go there. But, certainly our prime minister is not doing enough (in creating jobs),"" Mr Gandhi said.Mr Gandhi has repeatedly raised the issue of joblessness during his meetings with experts, business leaders and Congressmen in the United States.""Currently, we are not producing enough jobs. 30,000 new youngsters are joining the job market every single day and yet the government is only creating 500 jobs a day. And this doesn't include the massive pool of already unemployed youngsters,"" Mr Gandhi had said in his earlier address at the University of California in Berkeley.At Princeton, Mr Gandhi said India needed to transform itself to compete with China, and for that the people in the country required jobs.""Those same people who got angry with us because we couldn't deliver on those 30,000 jobs (a day) are going to get angry with Mr Modi. The central question is resolving that problem. My main issue with Mr Modi is that he diverts that issue and points the finger somewhere else instead of saying listen we have a problem,"" he said.""There is anger building up in India right now. We can sense it. So to me the challenge is how to solve that job growth problem in a democratic environment. That is the challenge,"" he said.""So we have to first accept it as a problem. Then we have to unite and try to solve it. Right now, nobody is even accepting it as a problem,"" he argued.Focusing a major part of his question and answer session at Princeton on jobs, Mr Gandhi asserted that new technologies and modernisation are unlikely to kill jobs.""The nature of what we call it a blue collar job is going to change. But the question is who is going to have those jobs and which countries are going to have access to those jobs,"" he said.Mr Gandhi also raised the issue of ""polarisation in India"". He said that the ""politics of polarisation"" was a central challenge in India and some sections of the society, including the minority communities and tribal people, who do not feel that they are a part of the ruling BJP's vision.""In the 21st century, if you leave some people out of your vision, you are asking for trouble. New ideas would come, new different visions would develop. So, to me, central challenge in India is politics of polarisation where you pit one community against the other and you create spaces for other people to come in,"" Mr Gandhi said.""There is a belt of 100 million tribal people who do not feel comfortable with the vision (of the BJP). There are a number of states in India, which don't want a single vision forced down their throat. There are minority communities, they do not feel that they are a part of the vision. So that's where the real danger is,"" Mr Gandhi said in response to a question.India's strength has always been its ability to embrace people, he said."
170,"Underemployment More Serious Than Unemployment, Says NITI Aayog","The NITI Aayog has warned about underemployment, saying it is more dangerous than unemployment

""Severe underemployment"" and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, the government think tank NITI Aayog said in a report.The opposition Congress party recently claimed that unemployment was rising in India and criticised the Narendra Modi government.In its draft action report that covers three years from fiscal 2018 to 2020, the NITI Aayog stressed on the need for creating high-productivity and high-wage jobs. ""Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India's problems. The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment. A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,"" NITI Aayog said in the report.The draft report was circulated among the think tank's Governing Council members comprising all chief ministers and other officials on April 23.The NITI Aayog said the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which tracks India's employment situation, has consistently reported low but stable rate of unemployment for over three decades, which goes contrary to assertions that India's growth has not been driven by job growth.The NITI Aayog, quoting an NSSO report, said that in fiscal 2012, 49 per cent of India's workforce was employed in agriculture, but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India's Gross Domestic Product at current prices.In fiscal 2011, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India's manufacturing workforce, but contributed only 12 per cent to manufacturing output, the NITI Aayog said in the report.An NSSO survey of service firms in fiscal 2007 found that the 650 largest companies accounted for 38 per cent of services output, but only employed two per cent of service workers, the NITI Aayog said.""Put another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the workforce but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,"" the report said. Citing the example of China's ageing workforce, the NITI Aayog called for taking steps to attract big companies from China to India, which can provide a large number of workers at competitive wages.""The experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers,"" the NITI Aayog report said.""The Make in India campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,"" it said. The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many big firms in labour-intensive sectors in that country are scouting for lower-wage locations. ""With its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,"" the NITI Aayog report said."

BJP President Amit Shah on Friday said the Narendra Modi government is the ""most decisive and transparent"" the country has seen, without a single case of corruption against it, and its rule in the last three years has ended casteism, family rule and appeasement politics. Addressing a press conference to mark the third anniversary of the Modi government , Mr Shah said what could not be achieved in the last 70 years was achieved by this government in the short period. He also brushed aside concerns over unemployment, saying it was not possible to give jobs to every person in a country of 125 crore.""We have tried to give new perspective to employment as it is not possible to provide employment to everyone in a country of 125 crore people. We are promoting self-employment and the government has made eight crore people self-employed,"" Mr Shah told reporters.The comments came amid renewed attack by the Opposition on the government's employment numbers.""Modi government had promised to give employment to two crore youths annually but actually it had been able to give jobs to only 1.35 lakh people in 2015 and in 2016 too it could give jobs to about as many people,"" Congress spokesman Abhishek Manu Singhvi said at a press conference yesterday.But slamming the previous Congress-led UPA government, Mr Shah said the earlier political establishment was marked by policy paralysis and a string of scams.

Minister of State for Labour Santosh Gangwar said the government is conducting a new Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) with new parameters and bigger sample size, and its results cannot be compared with previous surveys in this regard.

""As per the new Periodic Labour Force Survey being conducted by the government, the labour force participation is 36.9 per cent and the rate of unemployment for 2017-18 is 6.1 per cent,"" he said.

Replying to supplementaries during the Question Hour, the minister said the report of this survey is very different than the surveys conducted in previous years.

This survey is not comparable to previous surveys, he said, adding it was an attempt to provide authentic data with the new survey conducted through the Ministry of Statistics.

""We are focusing on infrastructure development and ease of doing business and India's position in the world has improved. India has improved its position to 63rd rank now in 2019 against 196 in previous years,"" he said.

""Our government is very conscious of creating employment opportunities and is running such programme which generate employment. The way our government is functioning, employment opportunities are being created and the youths are getting jobs also,"" the minister said.

Mr Gangwar said the government has stopped the previous survey as the sample size was low and an attempt is being made to improve the data by adding various parameters and provide more authentic data.

The minister said it will take time for collection of data as households have to be visited on the ground for authentic data collection in rural areas also."

Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over lack of jobs in the country, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Sunday said it would be good for the unemployed people if the PM could suggest any ""asana"" (yoga posture).

""Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about doing 'surya namaskar' for strengthening his back. It would be good if he could suggest a similar 'asana' to unemployed youngsters,"" he said.

""Unemployment is rising in the country. The prime minister does not have any time to think about it. At least he could suggest an 'asana', "" he added.

PM Modi had hit out at opposition leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, whom he dubbed as a ""tubelight"", saying it took him 30-40 minutes to respond to his speech in the Lok Sabha.

Without naming Rahul Gandhi, the prime minister, in his reply to the discussion on the presidential address, referred to the Congress leader's comments about ""youngsters beating up Modi with sticks over the lack of jobs"", and said he would increase the number of ""surya namaskar"" so that his back could bear the sticks.

""In these six months, I will do more surya namaskar so that my back is ready for the beating.... I have been subjected to abuses in the last 20 years, I will make myself gaali-proof as also danda-proof,"" PM Modi had said.

Referring to the exit polls for Delhi Assembly elections, which have predicted a victory for the AAP, Mr Yadav said, ""The residents of Delhi have rejected the politics of the BJP, which is full of hatred. The BJP, which has suffered defeats in a number of states, will not be able to open its account in the Delhi Assembly election and the Aam Aadmi Party's (AAP) Arvind Kejriwal will once again become the chief minister.""

Mr Yadav said that his party was completely against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), National Register of Citizens (NRC) and National Population Register (NPR).

""The BJP is working with a sense of vengeance and harassing even those who are commenting on the social media. The SP is seeing this and such people are being identified.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said rising prices of essential commodities and unemployment have thrown the country into a state of ""financial emergency"".

He accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ""snatching away"" the poor man''s bread and ""breaking into pieces"" the domestic budget of Indians.

""Back-breaking inflation, life-threatening unemployment and falling GDP has created a state of ''financial emergency''. Rise in prices of vegetables, pulses, edible oil, LPG gas and other food items has snatched away the poor's bread and butter. Modi ji has broken the domestic budgets of countrymen into pieces,"" Mr Gandhi said on Twitter.

Retail inflation rose to about five-and-half year high of 7.35 per cent in December 2019, surpassing the RBI's comfort level, mainly due to spiralling prices of vegetables as onions were selling costlier.

The unexpected jump in inflation diminished the chances of the RBI cutting interest rate at its next monetary policy review due in early February.

As per data released by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Monday, the spike in inflation in the vegetable segment was 60.5 per cent during the month compared to December 2018."

Highlights Report by industry body CII found surge in small business job creation

Report extrapolates findings from just one sector, survey in few states

Report contradicts others which claim high unemployment, shrinking sector

Amid a swirling debate over unemployment in India ahead of general elections next month, a recently released survey by top industry body, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), which reported a surge in job creation in India's small businesses, found favour with the government.

A number of ministers - from Railways Minister Piyush Goyal to Information Minister Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore tweeted the findings of the report, which found that job creation in the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector had grown by 14 per cent from 2014-18, the first 4 years of the Modi government.

The impact of the revolutionary Mudra scheme on a growing, hungry MSME sector is clearly showing!https://t.co/Q5UrMhZzhr - Rajyavardhan Rathore (@Ra_THORe) March 8, 2019

The finding startled observers, given the mass of data, official and private, which suggested a deepening of India's unemployment problem, as well as a slowdown of the small businesses sector.

An analysis of the CII report throws up a number of questions over its findings and methodology.

The CII admits that its sample for the survey, of one lakh firms, is heavily skewed towards India's more advanced states like Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka. The number of firms polled in these states amount, respectively, to 25 per cent, 12 per cent and 8 per cent of the total survey. The basis for greater 'bias' to these states, according to the survey, is because of higher employee provident fund enrolments in these states.

But government data shows that the share of MSME's in these three states is far less, at 8 per cent, 6 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, much lower than states such as Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

The CII report found that between 2014 and 2018, job creation grew at 3.3 per cent annually in the MSME sector.

However the government's own data from the ministry of MSME, shows that between 2006 and 2016, the annual growth rate of employment in the MSME sector was 3.6 per cent, a touch higher than the CII's number.

Eight of those 10 years predate the Modi government.

The survey has also invited criticism for projecting the total job growth in the country using its study of the MSME sector.

According to the CII study, the total workforce in the country is 450 million. ""A simple extrapolation of the findings from the survey (of 3.3 per cent job growth in MSMEs) on macro-level data indicates that 13.5 - 14.9 million (1.3 -1.5 crore) jobs were created per annum,"" the survey states.

This is flawed reasoning, argue experts, given that every sector grows at a different pace. For instance, the annual job growth in the manufacturing sector was 1 per cent while, in the construction sector was -3 per cent between October 2016 and 2017.

The correct method would have been to project job creation on the basis of the size of the workforce employed by the MSME sector alone, which is 110 million (according to government data), not 450 million.

Attempts to seek a response from CII were unsuccessful.

""CII is a pretty well established organisation and I think it is important that its credibility is not damaged too much. Anyone who does a survey would very easily indicate that there are many problems in this,"" Mahesh Vyas, MD and CEO of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy told NDTV."
180,"""India Lost Over 1 Crore Jobs In 2018"": Congress Slams BJP Citing Report","Congress alleged that the Centre failed to fulfil its promise of providing two crore jobs every year.

The Congress on Sunday targeted the BJP-led Centre over ""growing employment"" in India, citing a think-tank report to claim that over one crore jobs were lost last year.

Referring to a report by the think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari alleged that the BJP-led NDA government failed to fulfil its promise of providing two crore jobs every year and that the country lost one crore jobs instead.

""During the 2014 elections, PM Modi had promised ''Acche Din'' (good days), which included (providing) two crore jobs every year. In five years, this sums up to 10 crore (jobs).

""But recently, a reputed think-tank, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), released a report on employment. It states that more than one crore people lost their jobs in just one year (2018),"" he said.

The Congress leader said according to the report, in December 2017, 40.79 crore people were employed. In 2018, it was reduced to 39.07 crore.

""Which means more than one crore people lost their jobs. It is astonishing that more than 80 per cent of those unemployed were women and more than 90 per cent belonged to rural India,"" Mr Tewari said citing the report.

He also claimed that India's unemployment rate increased to 7.4 per cent in December 2018.

""This is the highest in a decade. Daily wage labourers and small businesses suffered the most. These are the same who were affected by demonetisation,"" the Congress leader said.

Mr Tewari also alleged that the Narendra Modi government has failed to understand that distress in society and smooth functioning of economy do not go hand in hand."
181,"""Would Have Been Social Chaos"": NITI Aayog Dismisses Unemployment Claim","In a sense, the entire budget is about job creation, vice-chairman of Niti Aayog Rajiv Kumar told NDTV.

Government think tank Niti Aayog today brushed off an unreleased report from National Sample Survey Office that contended that unemployment was on a four-decade high that has fuelled the latest conflict between the government and the opposition. The government has said the report was incomplete and hence was not released.

""If there was highest unemployment in 5 decades there would have been social chaos,"" Rajiv Kumar, the vice-chairman of Niti Aayog told NDTV. Dismissing the opposition contention that there are no jobs, he said the ""entire budget, in a sense, is about job creation"".

His views were supported by his boss, Niti Aayog's Chief Executive Officer Amitabh Kant. ""The story of jobs is all over this budget. You cannot have growth without distributed prosperity,"" Mr Kant said.

The opposition Congress has contended that ""jobs"" was one of the two words missing from the interim budget, which, they said was the government's ""last jumla (political gimmick)"" and ""political manifesto"" before the national elections due by May.

Yesterday, Business Standard newspaper reported that the unemployment rate in the country was at a 45-year-high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. The data it quoted was from the National Sample Survey Office's periodic labour force survey.

Two non-government members of the National Statistical Commission, which vets the report, had quit on Tuesday, accusing the centre of withholding its release.

Explaining the situation, Mr Kumar said, ""When the (jobs) report came to the government, we realised the data for subsequent quarters was missing. And that's why it was not released"".

Noted economist and Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra has accused the government of ""lies and data manipulation"".

""The way economists look at job creation is how many people are joining the labour force. Yes, growth creates jobs but is it enough? No, there is 6.1% unemployment,"" he told NDTV today. ""In every sector, you have lies and manipulation of data - something you haven't seen in India before,"" he added.

Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has warned that in the coming days, the government will have to face ""surgical strike"" from the opposition over a number of issues. The list, he said, would include jobs, the ""biggest issue the country is facing, demonetization and corruption, as seen in the Rafale jet fighter deal""."
182,"Claims Of Rising Unemployment A ""Political Gimmick"", Says PM Modi","Dismissing claims of unemployment, PM Modi said 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector. (File)

Calling the opposition claims on rising unemployment a ""political gimmick"", Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that over 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone, in the last one year.

Based on Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) data, more than 45 lakh formal jobs were created between September 2017 and April 2018, PM Modi said in an email interview to The Times of India published on Sunday.

""According to our study based on the EPFO data, more than 70 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector alone last year,"" he said.

Attacking the opposition, he said that rather than the so-called failure of this government to create jobs, ""I believe the shortcoming lies in the absence or lack of a streamlined database of jobs. Naturally, in the absence of information, our opponents will exploit this situation and blame us for not creating jobs"".

PM Modi also called the opposition's claim of rising unemployment a ""propaganda"".

""If you look at claims made by the state governments -- Bengal says it created 68 lakh jobs and the previous Karnataka government claimed it created 53 lakh jobs -- are we saying that all the country's jobs are being created in some states and that other states and the country as a whole are not creating jobs? This propaganda on jobs by the opposition is nothing but a political gimmick,"" he said.

PM Modi said that informal sector accounts for around 80 per cent of all jobs and creation of jobs in the formal sector has a spin-off effect on job creation in the informal sector.

""There are close to three lakh village-level entrepreneurs who run common service centres across the country and create employment. More than 12 crore loans have been given under MUDRA Scheme,"" he said.

PM Modi said that in the last four years, construction roads, railways and residential areas was undertaken and that led to generation of jobs.

""All reports, whether national or international, show that poverty in India is on the decline. Can we think of such a possibility without people having jobs?"" he asked.

Asserting that tourism provides maximum employment, PM Modi said that the country's tourism sector has been growing rapidly with foreign tourist arrivals in India in 2017 registering a growth of 14 per cent over 2016.

Airlines are adding new aircraft on a monthly basis and the number of mobile manufacturing units in this country increased to close to 120, he claimed.

""These alone have generated 4.5 lakh direct and indirect jobs,"" he said."
183,Unemployment In India To Increase Marginally In 2017-18: Report,"Highlights Job creation in India not expected to pick up in 2017, 2018, says report

Unemployment in India projected to rise marginally in 2017, 2018

India performed slightly well in job creation in 2016, UN report adds

United Nations: Unemployment in India is projected to witness marginal increase between 2017 and 2018, signalling stagnation in job creation in the country, according to a UN labour report.



The United Nations International Labour Organisation (ILO) released its 2017 World Employment and Social Outlook report yesterday, which finds economic growth trends lagging behind employment needs and predicts both rising unemployment and worsening social inequality throughout 2017.



Job creation in India is not expected to pick up pace in 2017 and 2018 as unemployment rises slightly, representing a near stagnation in percentage terms.



""Unemployment in India is projected to increase from 17.7 million last year to 17.8 million in 2017 and 18 million next year. In percentage terms, unemployment rate will remain at 3.4 per cent in 2017-18,"" the report added.



India had performed slightly well in terms of job creation in 2016, when a ""majority"" of the 13.4 million new employment created in Southern Asia happened in the country.



The report also acknowledged that India's 7.6 per cent growth in 2016 helped Southern Asia achieve 6.8 per cent growth that year.



""Manufacturing growth has underpinned India's recent economic performance, which may help buffer demand for the region's commodity exporters,"" it added.



The report added that global unemployment levels and rates are expected to remain high in the short term, as the global labour force continues to grow. In particular, the global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly in 2017, to 5.8 per cent (from 5.7 per cent in 2016) - representing 3.4 million more unemployed people globally (bringing total unemployment to just over 201 million in 2017).



""We are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labour market entrants every year,"" said ILO Director-General Guy Ryder.



The increase in unemployment levels and rates in 2017 will be driven by deteriorating labour market conditions in emerging countries - as the impacts of several deep recessions in 2016 continue to affect labour markets in 2017.





The number of unemployed people in emerging countries is expected to increase by approximately 3.6 million between 2016 and 2017 (during which time the unemployment rate in emerging countries is expected to climb to 5.7 per cent, compared with 5.6 per cent in 2016), it said.""Almost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,"" said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.That statistic is even worse for emerging countries.Those living in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are facing the greatest risk. In contrast, unemployment is expected to fall in 2017 in developed countries (by 670,000), bringing the rate down to 6.2 per cent from 6.3 per cent in 2016.In Europe, notably Northern, Southern and Western Europe, unemployment levels and rates are both expected to continue to fall, but the pace of improvement will slow, and there are signs that structural unemployment is worsening.The ILO advocates policy approaches that address root causes of secular stagnation as well as structural impediments to growth.""Boosting economic growth in an equitable and inclusive manner requires a multi-faceted policy approach that addresses the underlying causes of secular stagnation, such as income inequality, while taking into account country specificities,"" said Tobin.Such progress, the ILO emphasised, is only possible through international cooperation. A coordinated effort to provide fiscal stimuli and public investments would go a long way to provide an immediate jump start to the global economy and could eliminate an anticipated rise in unemployment for two million people."
184,"More Workers, Fewer Jobs in World's Fastest Growing Economy","A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015

Highlights A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds

Job creation is a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi

Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old

It's been two years since India emerged as the world's fastest-growing major economy, but the rapid expansion has done little to improve the lot of Ashok Kumar.



Parked up and sitting on the kerb, the 25-year-old truck driver is going nowhere fast. He is the sole breadwinner for the 13 people in his extended family and his monthly salary is stuck at $150 (Rs 10,000).



With new, better-paid jobs hard to come by, Kumar lacks options. He fears becoming unemployed like his elder brother, who recently returned to their village in in Uttar Pradesh after months of searching in vain for work.



Data out on Wednesday showed India's economic growth slowed to 7.1 per cent in the quarter to June, a 15-month low. That is faster than other major economies, but not fast enough to create enough new jobs to absorb all the one million people who join the workforce every month.



A government survey found that job creation fell by more than two-thirds in 2015. Analysts at HDFC Bank estimate that for every percentage point the economy grows, employment now adds just 0.15 of a percentage point - down from 0.39 in 2000.



It's a major challenge for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has promised to create 25 crore jobs over the next decade.



""For one job, there are at least 20 candidates,"" said Kumar. ""If you want the job, you can't afford to bargain.""



Nearly two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people are under 35 years old. This rising demographic ""bulge"" will create the largest working-age population in the world. At the same time China, which has long curbed family size, will age as a society.



Whether this so-called demographic dividend will translate into the kind of economic gains seen in Japan and Korea, or lead to upheavals, depends on India's ability to generate jobs.



Yet, despite average annual growth of 6.5 per cent between 1991 and 2013, India added less than half the jobs needed to absorb new job seekers.



MORE WORKERS, FEWER JOBS



Under PM Modi, India has opened up further to foreign investment, hoping to generate more manufacturing jobs. A loan scheme for small businesses has been set up and there are plans for a $1.5 billion (Rs 10,000 crore) fund for startups.

India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37 per cent in February from 5.97 per cent in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65 per cent from 9.70 per cent, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed."
186,"Unemployment Rate At 9.3% In March Quarter, Lowest In 4 Years","The unemployment figures for the first quarter of this year are out and there is a slight reason for cheer for a government facing the biggest flak for not generating enough jobs.

The urban unemployment rate fell to 9.3 per cent between January and March this year, the lowest in at least four quarters. It stood at 9.9 per cent in the previous quarter, says a survey by the National Statistical Organisation. Quarterly data prior to the April-June 2018 survey period is not available in the Periodic Labour Force Survey and the January-March quarter's rate is the lowest since then.

The estimates are worked out on what is called current weekly status method. A person is considered as unemployed in a week if he did not work even for 1 hour during that week.

Joblessness among youth aged between 15 and 29 years was at 22.5 per cent during the January-March period this year, down from 23.7 per cent in the previous quarter. This segment accounts for over one third of India's 1.3 billion people.

The Narendra Modi government has been criticised for not regularly releasing comprehensive data on jobs. Figures had shown joblessness at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The labour force participation rate - the percentage of population that supplies labour force for all economic activity - was 36 per cent during the March quarter, the survey showed, potentially reflecting weak economic growth in Asia's third largest economy.

India's economic growth fell to an over four-year low of 5.8% in the January-March period. It fell further to 5 per cent in the following quarter.

The survey also showed that of the total workforce, 37.7 per cent were self-employed, 50 per cent were salaried or regular workers and 12.4 per cent were casual labourers."
187,Urban Unemployment Rate Drops To Lowest In 4 Quarters: Government Data,"The NSO said urban unemployment rate was 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018

Amid criticism over high unemployment rate, a survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO) on Saturday showed that urban unemployment rate dropped to the lowest level in four quarters at 9.3 per cent during January-March 2019.

The quarterly bulletin of Periodic Labour Force Survey by the NSO, released on Saturday, does not contain comparable figure for January-March 2018.

The NSO, which is a wing of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, stated in the bulletin that the urban unemployment rate (UR) was 9.9 per cent in April-June 2018, 9.7 per cent in July-September 2018 and 9.9 per cent in October-December 2018.

The first quarterly bulletin for the quarter ending December 2018 was brought out in May 2019. This bulletin for the March 2019 quarter is the second in the series. The data showed that UR in urban areas among males was at 8.7 per cent during January-March 2019.

This unemployment rate among male in urban areas was 9 per cent in April-June 2018, 8.9 per cent in July-September and 9.2 per cent in October-December last year. For women, the UR was at 11.6 per cent during January-March 2019.

While this rate for women during April-June 2018 was 12.8 per cent, in July-September was 12.7 per cent and in October-December last year was 12.3 per cent.

The government had been receiving criticism for high unemployment rates amid slowing economic growth. In May this year, government data had shown that unemployment rate in the country was 6.1 per cent of total labour force during 2017-18, the highest in 45 years.

The survey on Saturday pointed out that the overall labour force participation rate (LFPR) was estimated as 36 per cent in the urban areas during January-March 2019, as compared to 35.6 per cent during April- June 2018. The LFPR was 36.1 per cent in July-September and 36.3 per cent in October-December last year.

The LFPR for men was estimated to be 56.2 per cent, while for women it was at 15 per cent in the urban areas during the January-March 2019 period.

The LFPR for men was 56 per cent in April-June, 56.3 in July September and 56.4 in October-December last year.

Similarly, the LFPR for women was 14.6 per cent in April-June and 15.3 in July-September and 15.4 per cent in October-December last year. This indicates that women participation in employment has improved slightly till October-December last year but deteriorated a little bit in January-March 2019.

Labour force refers to the part of the population which supplies or offers to supply labour for pursuing economic activities for the production of goods and services and, therefore, includes both ""employed"" and ""unemployed"" persons.

The LFPR is defined as the percentage of population in the labour-force. Labour-force according to current weekly status (CWS) is the number of persons either employed or unemployed on an average in a week of 7 days preceding the date of survey. In Statement 1, LFPR in CWS are presented.

The country's unemployment rate was at 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, the statistics ministry said on Friday, confirming the figure leaked to Business Standard newspaper in January, which said it was the highest since 1972-73. The data was released a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi was sworn-in for his second term. The BJP won a huge majority in the general election that ended this month despite concerns over jobs and weak farm prices.

There has not been detailed official data on unemployment for several years, and the government declined to provide comparable numbers for the jobless rate. ""It's a new design, new metric... It would be unfair to compare it with the past,"" chief statistician Pravin Srivastava told reporters.

Business Standard, which first reported the figure in January, had said that it was based on an assessment carried out by the National Sample Survey Office between July 2017 and June 2018.

The unemployment rate was the highest since 1972-73, the newspaper reported without giving a figure for that fiscal year.

The statistics ministry also said that female labour participation rate in urban areas for the quarter ending December 2018 was 19.5 per cent, compared with 73.6 per cent for males.

The unemployment number comes as another set of data released on Friday showed that the economy grew at 5.8 per cent in the January-March period, its slowest pace in 17 quarters, and falling behind China's pace for the first time in nearly two years.

Unemployment and the economy had been pitched as major issues by the Congress during the campaign for the national elections. However, the party faced a crushing defeat in the elections, winning just 52 seats in the 545-member Lok Sabha.

The alleged suppression of the unemployment numbers before the elections had led to resignations from two independent members of the National Statistical Commission, the government-funded advisory body checks the quality of official data."
190,"50 Lakh Lost Jobs Over 2 Years, Trend Began Just After Notes Ban: Report","A government report leaked earlier this year said unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

Highlights Azim Premji University in Bengaluru released a report on jobs

Job losses are higher when women are taken into account, report says

A government report said unemployment rate at 45-year high in 2017-18

Fifty lakh men lost their jobs in the past two years beginning November 2016, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an overnight ban on high value currency, according to a new report. The timing of the start of the decline in jobs coincides with demonetisation but no ""causal link"" can be established based on the available data, says the ""State of Working India 2019"", released Tuesday by the Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University, Bengaluru.

The job losses are higher when women are taken into account.

""Whether or not this decline was caused by demonetisation, it is definitely a cause for concern and calls for urgent policy intervention,"" the report says.

It assesses that unemployment, in general, has risen steadily post 2011 and the higher educated and the young are vastly over-represented among the unemployed.

In addition to open employment among the educated, the less educated have seen job losses and reduced work opportunities over this time period. The numbers, says the report, clearly demonstrate why unemployment has emerged as the primary economic issue in the election.

A government report leaked earlier this year had said the country's unemployment rate rose to a 45-year high in 2017-18.

The National Sample Survey Office's Periodic Labour Force Survey, conducted between July 2017-June 2018, showed the unemployment rate at 6.1 percent, the highest since 1972-73. The report was withheld by the government but accessed by the Business Standard newspaper.

But NITI Aayog vice chairman Rajiv Kumar said the report was ""not verified"" and the ""veracity of the data is not known"".

The latest report says the decline in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) and workforce participation rate (WPR) has largely been driven by less-educated men in both urban and rural areas.

""Clearly, there is a large differential impact by level of education. This is consistent with the idea that the informal sector, where we can expect the share of less educated men to be higher, was hit hardest by demonetisation as well as the introduction of GST.""

The report says joblessness is not only a problem limited to the educated sections of the labour force. ""While open unemployment may still be low among the less educated, there has been a marked tendency to drop out of the labour force for this section, presumably due to loss of work opportunities,"" it says."

""If 7.5% is the real growth in Gross Domestic Product, and inflation is at 3-4%, the nominal growth needs to be around 11-12%. It would be absurd to say that there are no jobs in such a scenario,"" he said, referring to the controversial National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) findings.

According to the NSSO report, India's unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1% in 2017-18 -- the most since the early seventies. It also found that unemployment was higher in urban areas (7.8%) then rural zones (5.3%), and youth unemployment was at ""astronomically high"" levels of 13% to 27%. The report further claimed that more people were withdrawing from the workforce because the labour force participation rate is lower than in previous years.

Controversy arose after two non-independent members quit the data-collating body on Tuesday, alleging that the government was averse to releasing the report despite vetting by the National Statistical Commission in December. Congress president Rahul Gandhi used the issue to compare Prime Minister Narendra Modi to German dictator Adolf Hitler. ""NoMo Jobs! The Fuhrer promised us 2 Cr jobs a year. 5 years later, his leaked job creation report card reveals a National Disaster. Unemployment is at its highest in 45 yrs. 6.5 Cr youth are jobless in 2017-18 alone. Time for NoMo2Go,"" he tweeted.

Aam Aadmi Party leader Arvind Kejriwal linked it to the demonetisation initiative, calling it a ""mega scam"" orchestrated by the Union government.

Defending the government was planning body Niti Aayog, with its head -- Amitabh Kant -- asserting that the demand for jobs was being met. ""You can't be growing at 7.2 per cent and say no jobs are being created. To my mind, the major problem is the lack of quality jobs,"" he said.

Finance Minister Piyush Goyal also made a similar claim.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised two crore jobs every year in the run-up to the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

192,India Is The Nation Of The Most Unemployed In The World: Labour Bureau Statistics,"According to the Labour Bureau statistics, India has, today, become the nation of the most unemployed in the world; in the inclusive growth index we are at number sixty and in this case, we are far behind our neighbours.



On the economic development front, inequality and increasing unemployment is the biggest challenge for the fast emerging India. Self-employment opportunities are declining in the country and jobs are continuously decreasing.

But at the same time, another picture is that India is one of the fastest growing peak economies in the world. At some point in time, we have managed to climb up 30 places in the 'Business Accessibility Index'. So the question arises that what is the path of development that we are going to follow to ensure employment generation and equality for everyone?

Indeed, the pace of increasing inequality in India has reached historically high levels. The gap between the rich and the poor has increased alarmingly. This situation is the result of our unemployment growth and non-public spending on GDP growth path.

In the last few decades, most of the countries in the world have developed their economies, but due to privatisation, public capital, and resources have been reduced to the hands of selected few.

In India, economic reforms were implemented in the nineties. Since then, there has been an unprecedented creation of wealth in the country. According to the Credit Suisse Global, multinational financial services company, since 2000, there has been an increase in the value of 9.9 percent annually in India, while its global average has been only 6 percent.

But its benefits have not been found in the large population of the country. Despite India's share in global assets (sixth), the average assets of Indians are much lower than the global average.

In the meanwhile, the inequality has expanded in the distribution of public resources in the country and nearly one-third of the population is still forced to live below the poverty line. The condition is that India has slipped to the hundredth place in the Global Hunger Index of 2017, and in this case, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Myanmar and many African countries have a better performance than India, while we were at 97th in 2016.

According to Oxfam, only one percent of the people on the global level have only 50 percent wealth. But this figure stands at 58 percent in India and 57 billionaires have assets equal to 70 percent of the country's population.

According to another report from Oxfam, 'The Widening Gaps: India Inequality Report 2018', economic inequality in India is increasing rapidly. In the country's GDP, 15 percent of the wealth has been made, while the share was 10 percent five years ago.

India is the second largest country in the world in terms of population. About 65 percent of the population in the country has an average age of less than 35 years. Such a large young population could be our strength, but due to lack of adequate employment in the country, a large number of youth is unemployed.

According to data from the Economic Cooperation and Development Organisation, the number of young unemployed in the country is very high. This is causing the feeling of dissatisfaction in the society.

Similarly, in spite of all efforts, the participation of women in the total labor force of the country is only 27 percent (In the labor force, household work and care, such as unpaid work is not included). The latest estimates from the World Bank show that in the period from 2004-05 to 2011-12, 19.6 percent of the women moved out of labor force, which is a major drop.

The importance of women's involvement in the labour force can be understood in such a way that the International Monetary Fund estimates that if the presence of women in India's labor force becomes as much as that of men, then it will help in increasing our GDP by 27 percent.

In the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a special emphasis in Goal 8 has been given to 'continuous inclusive and sustained economic development for all, to promote full and productive employment and better work' by 2030. Also mentioned in the same goal - 'By 2020, substantially reduce the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training'.

India is also working towards fulfilling this goal and generating employment for all. Various schemes like Skill India, Make in India, Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMGEP), Pradhan Mantri Rojgar Protsahan Yojana, and Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana play an important role in this.

The Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship was formed in 2014 by the government. After which the Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas Yojana was launched in 2015. Its aim was to develop the skill of the youth to make them self-employed. But there were many obstacles to the success of this scheme.

Before the scheme started, there was no pre-assessment done of the requirement of the industries and the kind of skills that were being provided to the youth, resulting in a total mismatch when the scheme was launched. The level of training being provided was also below standard and not of the highest quality.

Workers of India are passing through a kind of transition period. The agricultural sector's contribution to the GDP is around 13 percent, but still half of India's population depends on agriculture. On one hand, the agricultural sector is not able to bear this pressure; on the other hand, people here are not required to have the skills required for other jobs. Perhaps, that's why the cost of MNREGA increases.

MNREGA is the only law in our country that guarantees 100 days of employment to all in rural areas. Although there have been many questions arising out of this, due to being only rural centric, guaranteed for only 100 days, corruption and other problems related to implementation, the importance of MNREGA cannot be denied.

In the concept of inclusive development, the development of people of all sections of society, castes, and communities have been included. In this scale, aspects like living, health, education, and environmental status are judged. In the coming days, if we continue to follow this model of development while ignoring the inclusive growth, the inequities will get deeper.

Therefore, it is necessary to increase the public expenditure on basic services such as education and health, and pay special attention to employment generation.

''India far ahead of US, Europe in women''s tech equity''

Bengaluru, Nov 6 (IANS) Women''s employment in technical jobs is far ahead in India than the US and Europe, said a global professional women''s empowerment advocate on Wednesday.

""The US is actually behind India in tech equity ratio, it is about 25.5 per cent in the US and even lesser in Europe. We are proud of the progress women have made in India,"" Brenda Darden Wilkerson, Chief Executive and President, AnitaB.org, told IANS on the sidelines of the Grace Hopper Celebration India 19, a women''s tech conference.

According to Indian IT industry body National Association of Software and Services Companies (NASSCOM), women IT employees in India constitute 34 per cent of the total workforce of 4.1 million people.

""Approximately, one third of IT employees in India are women,"" NASSCOM Vice President K.S. Vishwanathan told IANS.

Bengaluru headquartered global software major Infosys had a women employee share of 37 per cent at the end Q2, 2019-20, translating to roughly 88,446 employees.

On choosing India to annually organise the Grace Hopper Celebration conference after the parent event in the US, Wilkerson hailed the country as an important contributor to the tech industry.

""The women here are educated in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics), and have great aspiration for technology,"" said Wilkerson.

At the conference, she sounded the bugle for attaining tech equity in the order of 50:50 ratio by 2025, a goal to ensure 50 per cent women employees in technical jobs at all levels.

According to Wilkerson, the recipe to achieve tech equity is to extensively collaborate with multinational companies and hit at the root of the issues stopping women from blossoming on the tech landscape.

""Networking, support, mentorship and sponsorship are very important for the success of all people, men included. So we want to be able to provide these steps to women,"" Wilkerson said.

About the rationale for not yet collaborating with the Indian government, Wilkerson said that corporates are major tech employers with whom AnitaB.org is heavily collaborating for the women''s cause.

The non-profit organisation creates communities for women involving corporates to build digital platforms to reach women in the hinterland as well.

Named after American computer scientist Anita Borg, the organisation aims to connect, inspire and guide women in computing and organisations, which view technology innovation as a strategic imperative.

194,Why Female Participation In Workforce Is On The Decline In India?,"Why is female participation in the workforce on the dec¬≠line in India? It is a conundrum that is flummoxing many. As against a 45.4 per cent med¬≠ian female share of the workforce in 144 countries, a study released by Pew Research Center in March 2017 had ranked India, with 25.9 per cent share, among the 10 lowest. The study was based on labour force data from 2010 to 2016. The latest National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data for 2017-18, yet to be officially released, shows female participation in the workforce has dec¬≠lined further to 23.3 per cent, as per NSSO data reported by Somesh Jha in a business daily.

The new data raises questions on why women are not participating in the workforce in greater numbers when in most examinations for higher studies or even competitive jobs they seem to outscore male counterparts. The latest NSSO data on youth (15-29 years) shows that their participation has dropped from 37.1 per cent in 2004-05 and 24.4 per cent in 2011-12 to just 16.4 per cent in 2017-18.

‚ÄúThe number of women applying for jobs is increasing, with more opting for higher education. But many opt not to take up a job if the job profile is not what they are seeking,‚Äù says R.P. Yadav, CMD Genius Consultant Ltd, a placement agency with over 50,000 employees on its rolls. Yadav feels that the new maternity leave provision of 26 weeks, as against the earlier provision of three months, has done much to put women candidates at a disadvantage when competing for a job against males. ‚ÄúThough the number of women in employment has risen, a rec¬≠ent trend is that a larger number don‚Äôt ret¬≠urn to work after taking maternity leave. Aro¬≠und 40 per cent opt to quit, bringing down their share,‚Äù opines Yadav.

While economists agree that longer maternity leave may have impacted chances of young women below 40 seeking jobs in the formal sector, they point out that this provision does not apply in the informal sector‚Äîemployer of a vast majority of women. Jayati Ghosh of JNU agrees that maternity leave has rocked the cradle to some extent as the burden has been kept only on the employer. ‚ÄúWhen you do that, employers would prefer not to employ women. There should be public provision for maternity benefit, which till now does not extend to the informal sector, tiny enterprises and self-employed,‚Äù says Prof Ghosh. She feels the government, through the National Food Security Act, should provide monetary help equivalent to three months of minimum wage.

Jayan Jose Thomas of IIT Delhi states that only social factors don‚Äôt contribute to the declining trend, as they were there earlier too. ‚ÄúPart of it, in the case of rural women, is due to withdrawal from agriculture due to mechanisation, fall in farm incomes, rapid urbanisation, etc. In 2004-05, we saw a rise in construction jobs, especially for males, which meant more income leading to migration from villages to towns.‚Äù

However, decline of women in the urban workforce should be of greater con¬≠¬≠cern. ‚ÄúThe period from 2004-05 to 2011-12 was one of the best in terms of economic growth when employment opp¬≠¬≠¬≠ortunities in industry and services sho¬≠uld have increased tremendously, with 15 million jobs being created every year. The actual increase in jobs was, how¬≠ever, only half the potential and women took the brunt of this. Things may have worsened post 2011-12,‚Äù says Thomas.

Bina Agarwal, professor of development economics and environment, University of Manchester, points out a striking statistic in the leaked NSSO employment report--the almost three-fold rise in unemployment rates for young rural women (15-29 yrs), from 4.8 per cent in 2011-12 to 13.6 per cent in 2017-18. The urban rate of 27.2 per cent is twice that. ‚ÄúThis reinforces what gender economists have long been saying--that women want to work, but lack jobs. The 2011-12 NSS found that 32 per cent of rural women engaged in domestic activities were willing to work, if they found suitable jobs. The much-discussed low labour force participation among Indian women is not due to cultural norms, dom¬≠estic work burdens and undercounting. It‚Äôs increasingly due to lack of jobs. Planning for female employment must also include safe transport and hostels near workplaces.‚Äù

Economists say that the way women‚Äôs work is defined in surveys is flawed. Sabina Dewan, president of JustJobs Network, states that while female participation in workforce has been sliding over last several years, the extent of the drop, whether female or male, actually depends on how each survey defines women‚Äôs work. ‚ÄúIf you look across surveys, the levels are not the same. So it is critical to have a standardisation of how we define women‚Äôs work,‚Äù Dewan states.

Renana Jhabvala, economist and social worker, points to a study conducted in Bihar four years back using NSSO yardstick that had revealed 56 per cent of women were engaged in gainful work, while the NSSO 2011-12 survey had determined 11 per cent women as working. ‚ÄúThe difference came up because of our deeper probe. Similar intensive studies in different states have come up with huge difference in data on women in workforce. Which bring us to the question: are we collecting the right data? Is the NSSO missing out a whole lot of women engaged in gainful activity?‚Äù asks Jhabvala.

Jhabvala, long associated with the Self-Employed Women‚Äôs Association (SEWA), says there is no dearth of women seeking gainful employment. Of the many reasons why numbers of working women are declining, she says, one is that many are opting to continue their education. There is also a push towards mechanisation, including in agriculture and changing family structures, from joint families to nuclear families. ‚ÄúAll these factors are leading to the drop. But more problematic is that when women enter the workforce they don‚Äôt necessarily find the jobs they are seeking, they are not allowed to progress same as men, they most often don‚Äôt even have parity in pay. There is persistent gender inequality in the labour market and women are often relegated to poor value add work,‚Äù states Jhabvala.

While more women opt to continue education, many are deterred by unsuitable jobs, bias in pay and work conditions vis-a-vis male workers.

Studies have also revealed that many women avail of the option not to work, or tend not to work. This worldwide trend is more pronounced in slightly better-off families. The better off you are, the better are the chances of giving up a middling or poor quality job or of quitting for family responsibilities, as a NSSO survey showed.

Indeed, once women take up jobs, factors like work atmosphere, safety, family support etc influence their duration in the workforce. Also, re-entry into the wor¬≠kforce after a break is often difficult, which partly explains the drop in par¬≠¬≠tici¬≠pation. From lack of family support to the easy availability of labour for low value-¬≠added jobs‚Äîmany are the factors that impede a return to work. In purely economic terms, if more women work, the more they have to spend, giving the economy a fillip. More needs to be done to arrest their decline in the workforce.

New maternity leave provision of 26 wks puts women at a competitive disadvantage; many don‚Äôt return to work"
195,Absolute decline in India's employment post 2013: Report,"New Delhi, Sep 25 (IANS) Indias structural transformation has been slower than desired resulting in a situation that there has been an absolute decline in employment post 2013, with the rate of unemployment among the youth now at 16 per cent, says a report by one of the country's noted private universities released on Tuesday.

The State of Working India (SWI) report by the Centre for Sustainable Employment at Azim Premji University said there is an urgent need to think comprehensively about employment and for the government to formulate a focused National Employment Policy.

""Even as GDP growth rates have risen, the relationship between growth and employment generation has become weaker over time. Growth creates fewer jobs than it used to. A 10 per cent increase in GDP now results in less than 1 per cent increase in employment,"" the SWI report said.

""Between 2013 and 2015, total employment actually shrank by seven million. More recent data from private sources show that the absolute decline has continued past 2015,"" it said.

""A recent study claims, to the contrary, that the economy generated 13 million new jobs in 2017. Unfortunately, this optimistic conclusion depends on selective use of data and unjustified assumptions. As a result, the rate of unemployment among the youth and higher educated has reached 16 per cent.""

India's new payroll data prepared by the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) shows that around 9.5 lakh jobs were created in the formal sector in July, as against the requirement of more than a million joining the workforce each month.

The SWI report conceives of India's ongoing structural transformation as composed of two processes -- movement of workers from agriculture to non-farm occupations and from informal to formal activities -- while it adds crucial considerations of social equity and ecological sustainability to this framework.

India's problem has traditionally been known as not one of unemployment but underemployment and low wages, according to the report.

""But a new feature of the economy is a high rate of open unemployment, which is now over 5 per cent overall, and a much higher 16 per cent for youth and the higher educated,"" it said.

""The increase in unemployment is clearly visible all across India, but is particularly severe in the northern states.""

According to SWI, adjusted for inflation, wage rates have grown in most sectors at 3 per cent per annum or more.

""But 82 per cent of male and 92 per cent of female workers earn less than Rs 10,000 a month,"" it said.

In this regard, the minimum salary recommended by the Seventh Central Pay Commission (CPC) is Rs 18,000 per month.

""Even in the organised manufacturing sector 90 per cent of the industries pay wages below the CPC minimum. The situation is worse in the unorganised sector,"" the report said.

Last but not least, gender disparities are still high but are reducing in some cases, according to the SWI.

Women are 16 per cent of all service sector workers but 60 per cent of domestic workers, while overall women earn 65 per cent of men's earnings.

""The Indian economy remains heavily gender segregated. Occupationally, women are under-represented among senior officers, legislators and managers. The situation has worsened with the proportion falling from 13 per cent in 2011 to 7 per cent in 2015,"" the report said.

The ratio of male to female labour force participation rate varies from less than 0.2 in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab to 0.5 in Tamil Nadu as well as Andhra Pradesh, and to above 0.7 in Mizoram and Nagaland, it added.

196,ILO meet on employment growth in India,"New Delhi, May 20 The International Labour Organization (ILO) will hold high level discussions to prepare a roadmap for India which needs to achieve 3.9 per cent employment growth per annum for meeting the target of employment for all by 2012.



The UN agency dealing with work and workplace issues has organised a two-day National Technical Consultation on Employment Policy for India here from tomorrow jointly with the Union Labour Ministry to evolve a new national employment strategy for the country.



A background report prepared for the meeting said employment-intensive growth did not necessarily require labour-intensive technologies to be used as growth could be promoted in sectors that are by their nature labour intensive.



The report said the strategies developed need to reflect the enormous economic contribution of women.



The meeting will take a diagnostic approach, said Leyla Tegmo-Reddy, ILO Sub-Regional Director for South Asia.



India has enjoyed impressive economic growth for more than a decade....We need to understand why employment is growing so slowly, particularly in the organized sector, and why employment in the informal sectors remains low quality, she said.



The meet will be attended by Mr Jose-Manuel Salazar-Xirinachs, Executive Director of the ILO and Abhijit Sen, Member, Planning Commission, among others.



Noting that the 11th Plan aimed at ensuring faster growth, Salazar-Xirinachs said this is in line with the ILOs mandated goal of promoting decent work for all.

An ILO spokesperson said discussions at the meeting would cover possible policy responses in a number of areas. These include economic policies relating to macro-economics and specific sectors, labour market policies, skills development, and enterprise development, in particular in relation to micro and small enterprises.



Representatives of workers and employers, academics, central and state government officials, Planning Commission members and policy makers will also attend the meeting. PTI"
197,"Absolute decline in jobs, says new EPW study, drop sharpest in last three years","There has been an absolute decline in employment ‚Äì number of people with jobs ‚Äì between 2013-14 and 2015-16, possibly for the first time since independence, a new study published in the EPW journal says. Three critical sources of jobs ‚Äì construction, manufacturing and IT services ‚Äì performed the worst, the paper by Vinoj Abraham of the Centre for Development Studies, Thiruvananthapuram, said. The construction sector is India‚Äôs largest informal sector employer.

The author combined data sources from three flagship labour market surveys‚Äì The Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Surveys (LB-EUS) the Quarterly Quick Employment Surveys (QES) and the Revised QES‚Äì for recent periods to show that while there has been an absolute drop in the unorganized sector, in the organized sector, the rate of growth of employment has tanked.

In a novel technique, the author uses both Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Household Surveys and the Quarterly Employment Surveys of Enterprises to get ‚Äúevidence‚Äù from both ‚Äúsupply and demand side‚Äù. While ‚Äúdemand side‚Äù is a term economist use to denote employers, supply side refers to job-seekers.

According to the Labour Bureau‚Äôs Employment Unemployment Surveys, total employment in the country shrank by about 0.4 per cent annually between 2013-14 and 2015-16 (going by the usual principal status criterion for those 15 years and above), a number which corresponds to 37.4 lakh people being unemployed. Usual principal status denotes a person who has been unemployed relatively for a longer period of time.

The study quotes the QES survey to state a ‚Äúdismal picture of employment creation in India‚Äù. After the October quarter in 2011, in no quarter were more than 2 lakh people employed. According to labour ministry data, nearly 12 million Indians enter the workforce in India every year. In three of the 12 quarters during 2014 and 2016, the situation worsened due to an ‚Äúabsolute decline in employment‚Äù.

The study states that the decline in job creation has been worst in the past three years. In the two years between March 2010 and March 2012, employment in the select sectors rose by 18.15 lakh, while in the next two years between March 2012 to March 2014, employment creation slowed down to just 6.2 lakh. In the following 19 months from March 2014 to December 2015, employment creation further slowed down to 5.92 lakh.

Between March 2014 and December 2015, average monthly employment creation declined to 30,000 jobs. And between March‚ÄìDecember 2015, the average employment creation fell to its worst levels: 8,000 jobs per month.

‚ÄúPerhaps this is for the first time in independent India that we have an absolute decline in employment,‚Äù Abraham writes.

Abraham also takes into account the organised and unorganized sectors. He says that the picture which emerges is one ‚Äúof an absolute decline of employment in India, with much of it probably in the unorganised sector, while the organised sector is seeing a sharp decline in the growth of employment.‚Äù

Abraham says India‚Äôs labour market is facing a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù with the employment rate stagnating across almost all sectors. Indicators have worsened since mid-2014 and the ‚Äúweakest among the working class are bearing the brunt of the employment decline,‚Äù the study said."

199,"Modi Govt Causing 'Extreme Labour Exploitation, Harassment', Says RSS-Backed Trade Union","RSS-affiliate Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) will launch a nationwide agitation on September 6 against the Modi government's reforms that it says have led to ""extreme exploitation and harassment"" of the labour sector and led to increasing unemployment in the country.

CK Saji Narayanan, chief of one of the largest trade unions in the country, told IANS that they would stage protests in all the districts demanding among other things, scrapping of ""fixed-term employment"", which he said was ""destroying"" the labour sector.

""Because of these so-called reforms, contract labour has now become the default model of employment in India. Today 67% of the organised sector workers belong to this category. The trend of contract labour system has increased with the elimination of permanent posts in private and public entities as well as government departments,"" Narayanan said.

He said contract labour system had expanded rapidly creating shortage of permanent employees and making it a means of enhancing profit in the public sector.

""We tried reasoning with the Labour Ministry several times but to no avail. The fixed-term employment is not just leading to rapid expansion of contract labour but also resulting in increasing the number of new unemployed youth.

""Therefore, we have to stand up to face the Himalayan challenge to make contract labour exploitation free,"" said Narayanan, adding that the Sep 6 nationwide agitation was only the beginning of a long haul fight to address the issue of rampant labour exploitation in the country.

The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA government had first allowed hiring fixed-term workers in 2003. This was scrapped in 2007 by the Congress-led UPA in 2007 following intense protests by trade unions.

After coming to power, the Modi government in April 2015 again mooted the concept by issuing draft rules for amending the Industrial Establishment (Standing Order). But the move was deferred following opposition from trade unions.

Union finance minister Arun Jaitley in his budget speech this year announced extending the facility of fixed term employment applicable only in the apparel manufacturing sector to all sectors.

Subsequently the Central government in March notified amending the Industrial Establishment (Standing Order) 1946 to extend the facility of hiring workers on fixed-term employment to all sectors.

Under the rules, a ""fixed-term employment"" workman is one who has been engaged on the basis of a written contract of employment for a fixed period.

The new rules, which provide that a temporary workman can be terminated without being given any notice of termination, has been widely condemned by all trade unions and they have been demanding its rollback.

The BMS has been vociferous in deriding the government's labour and economic policies and stridently opposed many of the labour reforms which it says has led to ""continuous unrest among contract workers and increase in breakdown of industrial peace"".

Apprehensive that the prevailing situation may lead to creation of ""new conditions of bonded labour"", the BMS, at its recently concluded National Executive Committee Meeting, adopted a resolution seeking immediate steps from the Centre to prevent open violations of labour laws.

""Incidents in Maruti Udyog at Manesar, Hyundai and Honda industries are vivid examples of the intense labour unrest. There is huge resentment among the entire labour sector. Unless steps are taken to resolve the issues, the situation will only worsen,"" warned Narayanan.

Highlighting the plight of contract labour, the BMS said these workers were denied any social security, pension, medical benefits, gratuity and leave. Besides being paid one-fourth of a permanent worker's wage, they were even denied minimum wages especially in the non-scheduled employment.

The BMS wants regularization of contract labour, amendment of relevant laws to secure ""equal pay for similar work"" and ensuring that contract workers were paid perks that permanent employees get.

200,"100% FDI in coal mining to create direct, indirect employment: Joshi","New Delhi, Aug 29 (PTI) Terming 100 per cent FDI in coal mining ""the biggest reform"" of BJP government, Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi on Thursday said the move will set up an efficient and competitive coal market in India and create direct and indirect employment in coal bearing areas.

On Wednesday, the government allowed 100 per cent foreign investment in coal mining and contract manufacturing.

""This is the biggest reform of our times and the influx of international players will create an efficient and competitive coal market in India. It is expected to bring state-of-the-art coal mining technology to the country which will help in environmentally sustainable mining,"" Joshi said.

The decision will also create direct and indirect employment in coal bearing areas and will have a positive impact in the economic development of these regions, he said.

The reform is likely to help the coal bearing states get more revenue and bring in more players to create an efficient and competitive coal market.

""The decision of 100 per cent FDI under automatic route for coal mining activities including associated processing, infrastructure in the coal sector is the biggest reform by Modi government which will help provide power to all 24x7,"" he said.

Terming the measure part of ease-of-doing-business, he said it will provide impetus to the economy.

203,RSS Trade Union Slams Govt Notification That Will End Permanent Employment In All Sectors,"RSS trade union Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) has called for an immediate withdrawal of central government‚Äôs new notification allowing fixed term employment, which will make ‚Äúhire and fire‚Äù legal in the labour sector.

In a press statement , BMS President, Saji Narayanan C.K, also accused that none of the objections raised by BMS was accepted by the Government.

As per the new notification issued by the labour ministry, the government had extended the facility of hiring workers on fixed term employment to all sectors. In his Budget speech earlier last month, Finance Ministry Arun Jaitley had said, ""the facility of fixed term employment will be extended to all sectors"".

Narayanan said, ‚ÄúIn 2003 the Vajpeyee Government brought fixed term employment. But the UPA government on seeing protests by Trade Unions, withdrew the controversial amendment. But again the present Government has brought it to made-up sectors, apparel and food processing. Now it is extended to all sectors.‚Äù

Taking on the government, the BMS said, ‚ÄúBy this notification, permanent employment will vanish from the industrial sector and all jobs will be converted into temporary contract works for a fixed period only,‚Äù adding, ‚ÄúIt is also highly objectionable that, a fixed term contract can be even cancelled by the employer unilaterally by giving only two weeks‚Äô notice.‚Äù

The BMS demanded that instead of bringing this notification thegovernment should stop the increasing contractualisation in permanent jobs in the country. It also accused that the Finance Minister has violated the ILO convention 144 on Trade Union Consultation which was ratified by the Indian Parliament, when he unilaterally declared that the fixed term employment will be implemented.

It said the Government did not properly conduct several rounds of consultation with Trade Unions. The amendment is brought in a hasty way.

‚ÄúThis is a backdoor method of Bureaucrats taking up the legislative power enjoyed by the parliament on matters of National importance. The amendment is brought about under pressure from a powerful Industrial lobby,‚Äù said Narayanan."
204,''Women entrepreneurship can create 150-170 mn jobs in India'',"''Women entrepreneurship can create 150-170 mn jobs in India''

New Delhi, Feb 18 (IANS) Women in entrepreneurship can generate transformational employment in India and generate 150-170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population by 2030, a new report said on Tuesday.

A joint report by Bain & Company and Google titled ""Women Entrepreneurship in India - Powering the economy with her"", underlines the need to accelerate efforts to grow women entrepreneurs in India in both quantity and quality to solve employment challenges in the country.

""In spite of India''s economic progress in the last decade, women''s participation in the labour force has declined and is expected to be under pressure due to labour trends, technological disruption and constraining social barriers,"" said lead author Megha Chawla, Partner, Bain & Company.

""Unlocking entrepreneurship amongst women in India is a complex effort, but it provides an unprecedented opportunity to change the economic and social trajectory of India and its women for generations to come,"" Chawla added.

""This will drive tremendous job creation and also deliver transformational social and personal outcomes for women,"" she added.

The report identified six dominant segments of women entrepreneurs and estimates India to have 13.5-15.7 million women-owned enterprises, representing approximately 20 per cent of all enterprises today.

In many cases, women are named as owners for financial and administrative reasons with no active role to play, which overstates true entrepreneurship amongst women.

Of all women-owned enterprises, a majority are single person enterprises, with the largest group represented by rural non-farm home-based business owners at 38 per cent, followed by urban self-employed women solopreneurs at 31 per cent, who usually work from home.

According to the study, the other dominant segments include rural agripreneurs who are farm-based business owners at 18 per cent and small business owners at 14 per cent - split across urban (6 per cent) and rural (8 per cent) - employing less than 10 employees and contributing most to employment generation.

Finally, there are the scalers, who employ more than 10 people and account for less than one per cent.

In total, these women entrepreneurs provide direct employment to an estimated 22 to 27 million people today.

The report projects an opportunity to accelerate both quantity and quality of entrepreneurship to create over 30 million women-owned enterprises out of which 12 million can generate employment.

""At Google we have been investing in scaled skilling efforts across SMBs, Startups and overcoming the digital gender gap in the country through the Internet Saathi program. Across all our programs, we have seen that women are hungry for opportunities to grow their household incomes,"" said Sapna Chadha, Senior Country Marketing Director, Google India and Southeast Asia.

""Hundreds of women in rural India want to learn more about doing business and many have already made the start to enhance their livelihoods. We are already running a pilot accelerator program for rural entrepreneurs from our Internet Saathi network,"" Chadha added.

According to Chadha, this joint effort report with Bain is a start to better understand the barriers facing the various types of women entrepreneurs across India and find synergies with like-minded companies and the government to accelerate women entrepreneurship in the country.

205,HC raps US citizen for overstaying in India,"Mumbai, Aug 26 (PTI) Reprimanding a US citizen who has challenged his deportation from India, the Bombay High Court said on Monday the petitioner could not claim an entitlement to stay in the country just because he is from the United States.

""You accept there was a breach of your visa terms, then how can you claim an entitlement to stay in India?"" the high court asked.

""What is so special about an American coming to India? Just because you are a US citizen, do you think you can come and do any jugaad (a flexible or innovative approach to problem solving) in this country?"" it said.

""India is a great country for condoning. Everyone has a right here but no one has any responsibility,"" the HC remarked.

The observations came from a bench of justices S C Dharmadhikari and G S Patel while hearing a petition filed by 29-year-old Joshua Sadagursky.

Sadagursky was deported from the Mumbai airport in May 2018 after the authorities realised that he had breached his previous visa terms by overstaying in India and by taking up an employment in the country though his visa did not grant such a permission.

During his last visit to India between 2017 and 2018, he had overstayed and delayed approaching the Foreigner Regional Registration Offices concerned after his visa expired.

Sadagursky, who is now in the US and has not returned to India since, filed a plea in the high court challenging his deportation.

In his plea filed through his counsel Birendra Saraf, he argued that his deportation was ""arbitrary"" and he wasn''t granted a fair hearing.

The petitioner also argued that he merely worked for an NGO in India and taught underprivileged children here, and therefore, such an engagement could not be considered as employment.

The court, however, remained unimpressed with the argument.

Referring to his working with the NGO, the court said, ""So what? You are not doing any great service to India. You were in breach of your visa regulations.""

The bench noted that Sadagursky had also overstayed in India on a previous occasion in 2012.

""Can anyone do this in America? You try going to JFK after overstaying and seek a hearing. They will immediately put you on a plane and send you back to your country,"" the high court said.

The court has reserved its verdict on Sadagursky''s plea and will pass its orders in the coming weeks. PTI AYA GK IJT

206,Driving employment in real estate: Square Yards ramps up its workforce to over 2000,"New Delhi [India], Aug 9 (ANI): At a time when the employment scenario in the start-up eco-system and the realm of real estate is slowing down, Square Yards, the leading tech-backed transaction and aggregation platform for global real estate has succeeded in expanding its workforce at a phenomenal pace.

It has recently crossed 2,000 employees headcount, out of which around 85 percent are direct sales workforce, placing its real estate sales headcount over the largest of real estate developers, online and offline aggregators in India.

Moreover, around 10 percent of these employees are based in International locations, giving the company an unparalleled last mile International distribution reach.

Buoyed by its impressive country-wide and global expansion, Square Yards is enhancing its employee base by 10 percent month-on-month. It now has presence in over 40 Indian cities, across metros and tier II geographies as well as nine other countries besides India.

This rapid expansion spree along with the attractive career acceleration opportunities it offers to its employees has fuelled its growth tremendously as a company.

""Real estate is still not considered as the top choice for ambitious sales professionals in the Indian eco-system. However, at Square Yards we have been able to disrupt this scheme of things to a large extent. Today, we are able to attract and retain top talent from not only real estate but diversified industry verticals such as insurance, telecom and retail. A blend of superlative incentive structures and international opportunities is what has helped us making real estate sales job attractive, lucrative and fulfilling and is sure to propel us on an evolved growth trajectory,"" said founder and CEO Square Yards, Tanuj Shori.

Besides on the business side, Square Yards has managed to beat the overall industry average as well. It clocks 1,000+ real estate transactions and another 600+ of loan transactions each month and its annual revenue run rate stands at an impressive USD 30 million.

It dominates most of the Indian markets it operates in while it has already gained a virtual monopoly in major NRI markets across the world. Through its scale, Square Yards has created a platform that not only attracts customers, but also developers, real estate professionals, independent financial agents, business professionals, freelancers and financial institutions.

Square Yards has pioneered a unique online-to- offline (O2O) approach for customer acquisition and service delivery in real estate and it offers a perfect blend of advantages of both channels - the convenience of online-based rich research and data-driven insights and the assurance of a designated salesperson who assists the customer in property research, coordinates site visits, and helps in closing the deal with the developer.

Its sales advisors are able to convince the clients by virtue of their market knowledge, ability to do need based evaluation and many other ways in which they can connect the various dots along the bridge between developers and buyers. (ANI)

207,"Modi Government First In India's History To Manipulate Data, Says Yashwant Sinha After NSSO Report","Former Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha on Thursday hit out at the Modi government over non-disclosure of the the National Statistical Commission (NSC) report that claimed that the unemployment rate was at the highest in last 45 years and said that it was a ""very serious"" issue as it was for the first time in the country's history that a government ""is interfering and manipulating data"".

He said with resignation of two members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC), the body has become defunct because it has only two official members and ex-officials have left.

""This (non-disclosure of the report) is a very serious issue for at least those who understand that this is the first time in our history that a government is interfering with and manipulating data. And the latest is the most shoddy example of this,"" he told IANS in an interview.

His remarks came after the report, which the government had withheld from being released and accessed by Business Standard newspaper, said the unemployment rate was 6.1 per cent in 2017-18, post-demonetisation, and was at its highest level since 1972-73 -- the period since when the jobs data is comparable.

NSC acting chief P.C. Mohanan and his colleague J. Meenakshi, who were unhappy over the non-publication of the job data that had been due for release in December last year, resigned in protest on Tuesday.

Sinha said even before this NSC controversy, the country saw the ""spectacle"" of the back series growth rates where the government appointed the Committee under Sudipto Mondal who is an expert to work out the back series.

""And when they worked out the GDP growth series, which showed that UPA had done better than the present regime, then it was withdrawn. And the NITI Aayog, which has nothing to do with data and statistics, was asked to study those figures.

He alleged that the NITI Aayog then ""revised these figures, manipulated those figures and came out with other set of figures which showed that starting with the (former Prime Minister Atal Bihari) Vajpayee years and under this government India has recorded highest growth rate in the five years of this government"". They did not beleive it,"" he said.

Referring to the unemployement issue, he said first it was demonetisation followed by a ""flawed"" goods and services tax that had a ""tremendous impact"" on the economy especially on the agriculture, the informal sector like construction and the MSME sectors. ""These three sectors were very badly hit, not so much like the corporate organised sector.""

He said specialised centres of production such as Noida, Tirupur, Agra and many such centres spread across the country had to retrench labour because it was not worthwhile for them to carry out business they were doing and many of these people who were employed went home.

""We had an anecdotal evidence but there were no hard evidence which would have been collected to prove the point. So, the government kept on challenging us and saying that it is not true,"" he said.

Sinha said that other anecdotal evidence which was available was the budgetary allocation for MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act).

""The budgetary allocation went up from Rs 55,000 crore to almost Rs 65,000 crore and even that was inadequate to meet the demands. So why did the demand under MGNREGA suddenly go up? Because people went back home and were prepared to work as manual labourers and earn something,"" he said.

Sinha said all their arguments were rejected by the government. ""They kept telling people that everything was fine until this data came. Now, quite clearly, this has demolished the government's case of employment generation and presented a very, very dismal picture.""

Referring to the leaked report of NSC, he said that despite labour participation in the market delcining over the years, ""even then we have a picture where it has gone up to 6.1 per cent joblessness"" and it ""confirms the story that this Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy had come out with a report saying that there was a loss of 11 million jobs in 2018 alone.

""This is the reason why the government did not allow this data to come out, which led to the resignation of the only two official members in the Statistical Commission.""

Sinha said the NSC was set up during ther early UPA (United Progressive Alliance)-I years.

""When I was the Finance Minister I was not satisfied with the way data was collected. We appointed an expert Committee under Rangarajan to study the whole system of data collection, storage, dissemination in our country and suggest the steps to suit the whole system. He gave his report, then this report was studied by the government and finally this NSC was set up, from where these two members have resigned.

He also said that the Labour Bureau, which publishes quarterly data of employment generation, was stopped from doing that work.

Sinha also said that the Standing Committee of Finance had asked for a report from Ministry of Agriculture on impact of demonetisation on agriculture.

208,Women entrepreneurs can generate 150-170 mn jobs in India: Report,"New Delhi, Feb 18 (PTI) Women in entrepreneurship can generate transformational employment in India and generate 150‚Äì170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population by 2030, a joint report by Bain & Company and Google said on Tuesday.

India has 13.5‚Äì15.7 million women-owned enterprises, representing 20 per cent of all enterprises in the country, the report titled ''Women Entrepreneurship in India ‚Äì Powering the economy with her'' said.

The report said a number of enterprises reported as women-owned are not in fact controlled or run by women and a combination of financial and administrative reasons lead to women being ""on paper"" owners with little role to play.

Accelerating quantity and quality of entrepreneurship towards benchmarks from high-performing countries and Indian states can create over 30 million women-owned enterprises, of which 40 per cent (12 million) can generate employment, the report said.

""This can generate potentially transformational employment in India, of 150‚Äì170 million jobs, which is more than 25 per cent of the new jobs required for the entire working age population, from now until 2030,"" it added.

Of all women-owned enterprises, a majority are single-person enterprises with the largest group represented by rural non-farm home-based business owners at 38 per cent, followed by urban self-employed women ""solo-preneurs"" at 31 per cent who usually work from home.

The other dominant segments include rural ""agri-preneurs"" who are farm-based business owners (18 per cent) and small business owners at 14 per cent ‚Äî split across urban (6 per cent) and rural (8 per cent).

In total, these women entrepreneurs provide direct employment to an estimated 22 to 27 million people currently, the report said.

In spite of India''s economic progress in the last decade, women''s participation in the labour force has declined and is expected to be under pressure due to labour trends, technological disruption and constraining social barriers, Megha Chawla, Partner at Bain & Company, and the lead author of the report, said.

""Unlocking entrepreneurship among women in India is a complex effort but it provides an unprecedented opportunity to change the economic and social trajectory of India and its women for generations to come,"" she added.

This will drive tremendous job creation and also deliver transformational social and personal outcomes for women, Chawla said.

""Across all our programmes, we have seen that women are hungry for opportunities to grow their household incomes. Hundreds of women in rural India want to learn more about doing business and many have already made the start to enhance their livelihoods,"" she said.

The report outlined opportunity areas to unlock women entrepreneurship in India. It suggested that level-playing field for high-impact, employment-creating entrepreneurs be provided and expanding the funnel to get more women to start enterprises.

It also recommended that steps be taken to build, strengthen and scale productive rural ""agri-preneurs"".

""Implementing these interventions to accelerate prospective and current women entrepreneurs will need a deep recognition of the urgency, and a multi-year coordinated scaled effort between various ecosystem participants,"" Sri Rajan, partner at Bain & Company, and co-author of the report, said.

These participants include national and state governments, grassroot organisations, investment and banking communities, other private enterprises, educational institutions and media.

The report said that of the about 432 million working-age women in India, about 343 million are not in paid formal work.

An estimated 324 million of these women are not in the labour force and another 19 million are in the labour force but not employed, it said.

By 2030, India''s working-age population will surpass an unprecedented 1 billion, and up to 400 million women''s economic potential may be left unaddressed, it added.

""India needs to take a non-traditional approach. In addition to job creation by private and government sectors, entrepreneurship is a powerful, and largely untapped, opportunity for working-age women in India,"" the report said.

By creating jobs, fuelling innovation and furthering investment in health and education, entrepreneurship among women could transform of India''s economy and society, it said. PTI SR HRS

209,Unprecedented employment opportunities in India today: Modi,"Surat (Gujrat), Oct 25 (PTI) Citing disbursal of loans under the Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojna (PMMY), Prime Minister Narendra Modi Thursday said ""unprecedented"" employment and entrepreneurial opportunities exist in the country today.

Modi addressed the employees of Hari Krishna Exports, a prominent Suarat-based diamond processing-exporting firm, through video conference from Delhi.

The company, led by Savji Dholakia, gifted 600 cars to its employees Thursday as Diwali bonus at an event named as 'Hari Krishna Skill India Incentive Ceremony'.

""Around 14 crore loans were disbursed across the country under this (Mudra) scheme. Out of these, 40 lakh loans were given to the youth of Gujarat. In the last four years, loans worth Rs 7 lakh crore were disbursed under this scheme,"" Modi said in his speech.

""Out of all those who took loans under Mudra, over 3.5 crore youth were first-time entrepreneurs, as they have chosen the path of self-employment for the first time. Today, there exist unprecedented employment as well as entrepreneurial opportunities in the country,"" the prime minister said.

Two women, one of them a disabled person, and two male employees of the firm received keys of their cars from Modi himself in Delhi.

The prime minister said his government has been taking many steps to strengthen the gems and jewellery sector, as it is a significant generator of employment and a key contributor to the exports.

Referring to the ""Main Nahin Hum"" portal and app launched yesterday, Modi urged the company and its employees to dedicate some time for social causes.

He appealed Dholakia and his company to set themselves a target of making at least 100 villages ""digital"" by 2022.

210,Benefits of AI on employment outweigh concerns: Report,"New Delhi, Feb 15 (PTI) The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on employment is expected to be severe, but the benefits outweigh its concerns as it would lead to improved efficiency and cost saving, says a PwC India report.

According to the report titled ""Artificial Intelligence- Hype or Reality"", about 68 per cent of Indian business decision-makers believe AI will help their business in various ways such as boosting productivity, generating growth and addressing societal issues.

""While 65 per cent of participants agreed that AI is likely to have a severe impact on employment in India, a majority believed the benefits outweigh any employment concerns as AI will open up opportunities for people to do more value-added work, apart from allowing for greater flexibility and work-life balance,"" the report said.

Given that AI integration requires significant time and investment, the report also suggests that organisations would do well to prioritise those areas that could be automated with relative ease and with ready availability of data.

Moreover, companies should also focus those areas which would provide the most tangible and immediate returns in terms of improved efficiency, cost savings and customer reach.

""While AI holds the potential to truly transform our lives as individuals and enterprises, its growth and adoption are wholly dependent on overcoming challenges related to reducing costs, securing the right talent and data, and addressing concerns around privacy and trust,"" said Sudipta Ghosh, Partner and Leader, Data & Analytics, PwC India.

Ghosh further said ""the market reality we exist in today demands that we not only work towards upskilling our people, but also produce the smartest machines that can work with us"".

The 'Make in India' programme was also criticised by political leaders after the Vande Bharat Express, India's first semi high-speed train, broke down on Saturday while returning to the capital from Varanasi, a day after it was launched.

The locomotive-less train, previously known as Train18, was manufactured under the ambitious scheme by the Integral Coach Factory, Chennai.

""Modi's 'Make in India', like all his other schemes, has turned out to be a jumla and PR. Investment, employment, and exports in India's manufacturing sector have all declined sharply in the past five years,"" Yechury said on Twitter.

He said agricultural, manufacturing, employment and income growth are at a low under this government.

""Agricultural growth low, manufacturing growth low, employment growth low, income growth low... all things that matter to Indians are going lower under Modi. The only thing going up is the PR budget of Modi and jumlas from his speeches, as his cronies loot the banks,"" he said.

He alleged that the top ""12 crony businessmen friends of this govt owe public money which is TWICE the entire farm loan waiver!""

""Yet, Modi govt has been happy to waive off over 3 lakh crore of unpaid loans of friends and allowed looters to scoot. Nothing for farmers facing an unprecedented crisis,"" the CPI(M) general secretary further said.

""A political ideology which divides Indians and pitches one Indian against another is truly 'anti-national'. We all know who the proponents and leaders of that political ideology are, in our country,"" he alleged.

212,93% of H-4 approved work authorisation from India: US report,"By Lalit K Jha

Washington, May 11 (PTI) A staggering 93 per cent of the total H-4 visa holders in the US having work authorisation are from India, a latest Congressional report on the spouse visa has said.

Over one-fifth of the H-4 visa holders with work authorisation live in California, it said.

Ninety-three per cent of granted applications for employment authorisation were issued to women; seven per cent to men, according to the report on H-4 visas by the independent Congressional Research Service of the US Congress, which prepares periodic reports on issues of interest to US lawmakers.

""Ninety-three per cent of approved applications for H-4 employment authorisation were issued to individuals born in India, and five per cent were issued to individuals born in China. Individuals born in all other countries combined make up the remaining two per cent of approved applications,"" CRS said in its nine-page report.

As of December 25, 2017, US Citizenship and Immigration Services had approved 126,853 applications for employment authorisation for H-4 visa holders. These count all approvals since May 2015 when the rule was implemented.

This number includes 90,946 initial approvals, 35,219 renewals, and 688 replacements for lost cards.

H-4 visa holders are not geographically constrained by law, and approvals for employment authorisation documents have been issued to H-4 non-immigrants living in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the US territories.

California accounts for more than one-fifth (28,033), and Texas and New Jersey together account for another 20 per cent.

Before 2015, H-4 visa holders were not eligible for work authorisation.

As the visa queue increased for individuals in particular those from India and China awaiting employment-based legal permanent resident (LPR) status, policymakers and others raised concerns about the lack of employment authorisation for spouses hindering the US' ability to attract and retain highly educated workers.

In 2015 Federal Register issued a notice establishing work authorisation for certain H-4 spouses referred to three anticipated benefits: reducing personal and financial burdens on H-1B and H-4 non-immigrants, reducing disruption to the US businesses and attracting and retaining highly-skilled workers.

The previous Obama administration argued that allowing H-4 spouses to work would support the US economy because H-1B non-immigrants and their spouses have historically made significant contributions to entrepreneurship and research and development.

Finally, this rule may facilitate attracting and retaining highly skilled workers by bringing US immigration policies more in line with those of other countries that compete for similarly skilled workers, it said.

Unlike work authorisation for H-1B visa holders, employment authorisation that is granted based on H-4 status is not restricted to a specific employer and does not require the employer to get approval from the Department of Labour.

H-4 work authorisation also does not prohibit self-employment, starting a business, or hiring employees.

However, under its America First Policy, the Trump administration is proposing to remove from regulation H-4 spouses of H-1B non-immigrants as a class of foreign nationals eligible for employment authorisation.

The result would be that H-4 visa holders would not have authorisation to work in the US.

The administration anticipates publishing the proposed rule in the Federal Register in June 2018, which would be followed by a public comment period before a final rule would be published, CRS said.

While H-4 EADs have been issued to residents of almost 4,000 cities across the US, CRS said the cities with the highest numbers are around large ""tech hubs"" such as the Silicon Valley, northern New Jersey, Seattle, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, the Washington, DC, region and Atlanta.

CRS said Congress has considered several related pieces of legislation.

The Immigration Innovation Act of 2018 (S.2344), as introduced in the 115th Congress, would codify the current regulation providing work authorisation to H-4 spouses of certain H-1B non-immigrants and would require the employer of the H-4 spouse to attest that they will pay her or him the greater of the prevailing wage for that occupation in the area of employment or the actual wage paid to other workers in the same job with similar qualifications (i.E., applying the same pay standard to the hiring of H-4 visa holders as is applied to their H-1B spouses).

Previous versions of this bill (S.153, as introduced in the 114th Congress, and S.169, as introduced in the 113th Congress) would have provided employment authorisation to the spouse of any H-1B or L (intra-company transferee) non-immigrant, regardless of whether the H-1B or L non-immigrant had begun the process of obtaining LPR status.

These bills would not have required labour attestation.

Likewise, immigration reform bills in the 113th Congress (S.744, as passed by the Senate, and HR 15, as introduced) would have provided employment authorisation to the spouse of any H1B or L non-immigrant, regardless of whether the H-1B or L non-immigrant had begun the process of obtaining LPR status.

213,"Swedish biz delegation to focus on investment, employment opportunities during India visit","New Delhi, Dec 1 (PTI) A high-level delegation comprising of over 100 business leaders from Swedish companies like ABB, Ikea, Ericsson and Volvo is accompanying the King and Queen of Sweden during their six-day official visit to India beginning Sunday.

Giving details about the visit, Anders Wickberg, Swedish Trade Commissioner to India, said the delegation will hold meetings with Indian industry leaders in Delhi as well as Mumbai.

He said the visit is likely to generate high quality investments in the country which in turn will create technology transfer and employment opportunities.

Currently, over 200 Swedish companies are operating in India, employing over 2 lakh people.

In the last two years, employment through Swedish companies and investment have grown at over 20 per cent, Wickberg said.

The business delegation will be in India in conjunction with the state visit of Sweden''s King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia, he said.

India is Sweden''s third largest trade partner in Asia, after China and Japan. Mutual economic interests in areas including manufacturing, cleantech, and healthcare, among others, are driving trade relations between both the countries, he said.

Moreover, there has been an influx of Swedish retail companies, with Ikea and H&M pursuing rapid expansion both online and offline, Wickberg said, adding that media services provider Spotify too recently established its presence in India.

Ikea, which has a store in Hyderabad, plans to open 20-25 more stores in the country, he added.

During Prime Minister Narendra Modi''s visit to Stockholm in 2018, a Joint Action Plan as well as a Joint Declaration on Sweden-India Innovation Partnership for a sustainable future were signed.

This, Wickberg said, is set to deepen bilateral ties in the field of innovation, underpinning a mutual commitment to drive prosperity and address global challenges such as climate change and sustainable development through innovation.

""With this commitment, we work to increase our bilateral impact, and strive to build on joint solutions,"" he added.

With this visit of high-level business delegation, both the countries hope to strengthen their ties and focus on furthering the partnership, specifically in the areas of collaboration and co-creation such as innovation and sustainability, he said.

The delegation''s programme includes a number of networking sessions, panel discussions and roundtable meetings that will facilitate knowledge transfer and experience sharing, Wickberg said. PTI NKD CS RR RVK

214,'World Food India to bring employment in Chhattisgarh',"New Delhi [India], November 3 (ANI): Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Raman Singh on Friday asserted that the 'World Food India 2017' has opened possibilities of employment in Chhattisgarh.

""This event has opened possibilities of employment in Chhattisgarh. I will also be meeting companies interested in investing in the state. Chhattisgarh has a big share in the agriculture sector, and we are growing towards it,"" Raman Singh told ANI.

Applauding Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that the prime minister's speech on the possibilities of food processing was unique.

""This event also shows how all the states can use these possibilities to improve production, and different food processing units,"" Raman Singh asserted.

Singh added that food processing is also one sector, which is so wide that its tapping still needs to be done, adding that every state in India has variety of food and they can work upon developing it.

The chief minister was attending the World Food India 2017, which is a three day-long event, organised by the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, and is set to host a congregation of global investors and business leaders of major food companies from November 3 to 5 in New Delhi. (ANI)

215,ISF organizes conference on future of employment to re-engineer employment ecosystem,"New Delhi [India], June 14 (ANI): Indian Staffing Federation (ISF), an apex body of flexi staffing industry in India, today organizes 11th National Employment Conference themed 'Future of Employment'.

Experts from the government, employment industry, education fraternity and corporates participated in this event. They discussed the present employment ecosystem, mapped it against the future trends, identified future jobs and skill requirements and proposed a way to re-engineer the ecosystem. With the current fall in jobs between April and December 2016 where India just created 2.31 lakhs jobs (according to government's labor survey) these initiatives are most welcomed to streamline the roadmap for skilling and creating more employment opportunities.

Today's job market is witnessing changes at a rapid pace than earlier as the trends of digitalization and automation are affecting the core functioning of organizations. As per the recent report by Indian Staffing Federation only 15 major sectors drove the entire jobs market growth only in 11 states which is comparatively less in a country like India.

Every year 12 million workforce are added and five million people look out of agriculture for new job opportunities which means we need to have 70 to 80 million jobs per year. Thus, the need of the hour is to welcome other forms of employment which will help make people employable. Flexi staffing is integral hence. In the IT industry itself, despite lay-offs on the surge, flexi hiring is likely to grow 53 percent in IT sector by 2018 as staffing players know inside out and can help meet the existing skill gap of the IT industry.

""While further discussing on the future trends of employment, Rituparna Chakraborty, President, Indian Staffing Federation, said, ""The Future of employment is not jobs but creating an ecosystem which enables our youth to create their own work. In the long run the narrative shall shift away from permanent jobs vs temporary jobs, formal jobs vs informal jobs to a job of dignity irrespective of the form of employment,"" said president Indian Staffing Federation, Rituparna Chakraborty.

""Today, we are entering into a new era where shapes of enterprises and livelihoods are undergoing massive transformation which makes embracing lifelong learning an imperative towards ensuring sustainability. Despite the current layoffs and negativity in certain sectors, Indian jobs market seems to look positive in sectors like IT, Startups, Telecom and BPO and blue collar roles will gain prominence in these. It's important for businesses and industries not to find themselves blindfolded and hence we need to show up prepared to be ahead of the employment renaissance,"" added Chakraborty.

On the side lines of the conference, ISF also spearheads first-of-its-kind initiative called Staffing Mentorship Programme for the larger interest of the staffing industry. Twelve top staffing companies in India engage in one-on-one sessions with interested participants on their respective domains of interest and discuss the challenges of staffing business while identifying new growth areas.

216,62% Indians more satisfied with work conditions: survey,"Mumbai, Apr 19 (PTI) Employees in India, 62 per cent, are far more satisfied with their work conditions compared to those in Asia Pacific, as per a survey.

The 'Michael Page's 'Job Confidence Index Q1 2017' (January-March period), revealed that 62 per cent Indian employees are 'satisfied or very satisfied' with their working conditions compared to 53 per cent of employees in Asia Pacific.

However, in a city to city comparison in India, a number of major cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai, slipped in their work satisfaction rating during the first quarter this year compared to the last quarter of 2016, it said.

The Job Confidence Index Q1 2017, analysed the responses of 650 professionals in India and 4,700 across Asia Pacific.

It revealed that the three chief objectives for seeking employment in India remained unchanged, where 48 per cent of individuals aspire to acquire new skills, 39 per cent yearn for better work-life balance and 34 per cent consider income a significant factor.

Employees in India were more positive about work-life balance in the next 12 months (56 per cent compared to 55 per cent in Q4 2016) and development of new skills (85 per cent compared to 81 per cent in Q4 2016), it said.

While job hunting in India, better work-life balance (39 per cent) has surpassed salary (34 per cent) as the second most important factor.

""The Indian government has taken numerous initiatives to accelerate the economy through various sector focused initiatives. A robust demand for qualified professionals in a competitive market has resulted in the importance of skill enhancement among millennials,"" Michael Page India Managing Director Nicolas Dumoulin said.

He said, on the backdrop of an improved economic environment and adaptation to global culture, Indian professionals have a positive outlook towards a rise in job opportunities, wage growth and a better work life balance.

218,India sees rise in solar photovoltaic jobs: IRENA,"New Delhi, June 13 (IANS) India saw expand in solar photovoltaic employment in 2018, while China, the US, Japan and the European Union lost jobs, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) said on Thursday.

In total, 11 million people were employed in renewable energy worldwide in 2018, up from 10.3 million in 2017.

As more and more countries manufacture, trade and install renewable energy technologies, IRENA's latest 'Renewable Energy and Jobs -- Annual Review' finds renewables jobs grew to their highest level despite slower growth in key renewable energy markets, including China.

The diversification of the renewable energy supply chain is changing the sector's geographic footprint.

Until now, renewable energy industries have remained relatively concentrated in a handful of major markets, such as China, the US and the European Union.

Increasingly, however, East and Southeast Asian countries have emerged alongside China as key exporters of solar photovoltaic (PV) panels.

Countries including Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam, were responsible for a greater share of growth in renewables jobs last year, which allowed Asia to maintain a 60 per cent share of renewable energy jobs worldwide.

""Beyond climate goals, governments are prioritising renewables as a driver of low-carbon economic growth in recognition of the numerous employment opportunities created by the transition to renewables,"" said IRENA Director-General Francesco La Camera.

""Renewables deliver on all main pillars of sustainable development -- environmental, economic and social. As the global energy transformation gains momentum, this employment dimension reinforces the social aspect of sustainable development and provides yet another reason for countries to commit to renewables.

Solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind remain the most dynamic of all renewable energy industries.

Accounting for one-third of the total renewable energy workflow, solar PV retains the top spot in 2018, ahead of liquid biofuels, hydropower and wind power.

Geographically, Asia hosts over three million PV jobs, nearly nine-tenths of the global total.

Most of the wind industry's activity still occurs on land and is responsible for the bulk of the sector's 1.2 million jobs.

China alone accounts for 44 per cent of global wind employment, followed by Germany and the US.

Offshore wind could be an especially attractive option for leveraging domestic capacity and exploiting synergies with the oil and gas industry.

The solar PV industry retains the top spot, with a third of the total renewable energy workforce.

Besides India, PV employment expanded in Southeast Asia and Brazil, while China, the US, Japan and the European Union lost jobs.

Rising output pushed biofuel jobs up six per cent to 2.1 million.

Brazil, Colombia, and Southeast Asia have labour-intensive supply chains where informal work is prominent, whereas operations in the US and the European Union are far more mechanised.

Employment in wind power supports 1.2 million jobs.

Onshore projects predominate, but the offshore segment is gaining traction and could build on expertise and infrastructure in the offshore oil and gas sector.

Hydropower has the largest installed capacity of all renewables but is now expanding slowly.

The sector employs 2.1 million people directly, three quarters of whom are in operations and maintenance.

219,"Capgemini to hire up to 30,000 employees in India this year","Capgemini to hire up to 30,000 employees in India this year

Mumbai, Mar 1 (PTI) French tech major Capgemini, which employs close to 1.15 lakh people in India, is looking to hire up to 30,000 employees in the country this year, as it seeks to derive more value from its presence here.

The hiring will be evenly split between freshers and experienced professionals, or laterals, its country chief executive Ashwin Yardi told PTI.

The Indian workforce constitutes for over half of its global employees base.

""India forms a very important part of our business and we will hire 25,000-30,000 people here this year on a gross basis,"" Yardi said.

At present, it is focusing efforts on re-skilling employees for the technologies of the future, he said, adding that this has now become a continuous process.

It has been found that youngsters under 30, who make up for over 65 per cent of its workforce, show a keenness to learn, he said, adding that it is conducting special programmes for the mid-level managers having 10-15 years of experience who would be placed as project managers or architects.

Yardi said there has not been any ""restructuring or involuntary attrition"" beyond the normal course of exits due to performance-related issues.

Clients have become more demanding, wherein employees have to be moved into a project on an immediate basis, Yardi said, adding that the utilisation levels have not been because the training and skilling activities take place along side project work for an employee.

He said there is sufficient space at Airoli (near Mumbai), its biggest development centre, and also added that it has created capacity at other centres over the last two years which can accommodate the new joinees.

At a time when some of its peers are laying a lot of stress on research and development activities and are filing for patents, the company has taken a call not to do ''blue sky thinking'' and adopt the ""applied innovation"" concept to come up with client specific improvements, he said.

The company is also not keen to play on the products front and is happy being a services company, he said. It can be noted that many IT companies are focusing on products, and claim that it helps them maintain or widen profit margins.

The French company is also not investing in startups unlike some peers, but working jointly with over 150 of them on critical technologies, Yardi said.

He said the company believes in offering an entire bouquet of services to a client to meet the entire spectrum of needs, and discloses the work done by a startup to the client.

It has also hired a chief innovation officer from a startup recently, he said. PTI AA DRR

220,US based ITBD commits employment of 200 Indian IT professionals,"New Delhi [India], Sept 5 (ANI): A US based global IT infrastructure support ITBD has expanded its operations in India, post Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the United States in June, providing employment opportunities to more than 200 skilled IT professionals.

Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Minister of State (MoS) in the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore, on Monday inaugurated the new office of ITBD in Noida.

""Prime Minister Modi is a great visionary who started various programmes and schemes to make India the most favourable nation for global businesses and investors. India's efforts in reforming the taxation and licensing policies are well appreciated by economists all over the world, and we are keen to pursue our commitments,"" Rathore asserted.

Delighted to see the overwhelming audience at the inauguration ceremony, CEO ITBD, Sunny Kaila said that ITBD's expansion in India reaffirms the commitment to grow with India, and choose it as a top ITBD FDI strategy, even during the harsh political climate created under the Trump Administration.

The company has invested two million US dollars. The Noida expansion assures immediate hiring of more than 200 IT professionals, including infrastructure engineers, network engineers, Wintel engineers and technical help-desk support engineers.

The company also announced the launch of their IT Skills Development Program that will be providing IT students with 500 paid internships over the next two years. An additional 100 scholarships will also be given to underprivileged students to complete their degrees. (ANI)

221,Walmart lays off 56 employees in India; denies 2nd round of downsizing in Apr,"New Delhi, Jan 13 (PTI) Walmart India on Monday said it is letting go 56 of its employees, including eight from senior management level, as part of restructuring exercise.

The company, which operates 28 cash-and-carry stores in the country, said it is looking at ways to operate more efficiently.

""We are also looking for ways to operate more efficiently, which requires us to review our corporate structure to ensure that we are organized in the right way. As part of this review, we have let go 56 of our associates across levels at the corporate office,"" Walmart India President & CEO Krish Iyer said in a statement.

All of the 56 impacted associates, eight in the senior management and 48 in the middle as well as lower management, have been offered enhanced severance benefits and out placement services to support their transition, he added.

Iyer, however, ruled out a second round of layoffs in April, terming the speculation as baseless and incorrect.

He said the company remains committed to growing its B2B cash and carry business in India.

Walmart opened six new best price modern wholesale stores, one fulfilment centre and the company''s sales grew 22 per cent in 2019, he added.

""We have recently made significant investments to serve our members better and will continue to do so. This includes investments in our brick and mortar stores as well as e-commerce.

""Our members are increasingly becoming omni-channel shoppers. We are thus investing heavily in technology and have a healthy pipeline of best price stores. This will provide our members a true omni-channel and convenient shopping experience in the future,"" Iyer noted.

Layoffs at Walmart''s brick and mortar business began after it bought a majority stake in e-commerce retailer Flipkart in an around USD 16 billion deal in 2018.

Walmart, as per its strategy to strengthen presence in the Indian market and also compete head-on with global rival Amazon, had announced a mega deal to pick up 77 per cent stake in Flipkart.

Walmart had started B2B e-commerce in July 2014 from its Lucknow and Hyderabad ''Best Price Store'' and was later extended to other stores.

It was among one of the first companies in India, which had adopted the omni-channel retail system by integrating online and offline formats here. PTI MSS MR BAL

222,"Adapt Or Perish! As Old Jobs Shrink, Are You Prepared For Jobs Of Future?","Are you a welder or a sold¬≠ering machine operator in a power plant? Chances are, you‚Äôre not. A medical trans¬≠criptionist? Data entry operator? Machi¬≠nist? A teller at a bank? Perhaps, or some¬≠one you know is. Or was‚Ä¶. What‚Äôs common to all of them? They all sound slightly, er, 20th century, don‚Äôt they? This is a small sample-set of a certain kind of job not as universally to be found as before. Many of them did indeed require skills, patience and unceasing hard work, but some¬≠where, tragically but unrelentingly, they have been‚Äîor are in the process of being‚Äîoutstripped by the pace of technological obsolescence. Yes, there are still thousands of welders and machinists, perhaps more than before: it‚Äôs the ratio that‚Äôs changing. It‚Äôs the shrinking proportion of such jobs, in relation to the total, that tells us of a sea-change. And yes, job security. Once you could spend decades in a job, even in the private sector. Now, when even government is downsizing, you could be looking at five years max, if you‚Äôre lucky.

Say you‚Äôre 19, just a year or so short of entering the job market. You‚Äôd be too young to remember a time when learning typing and shorthand was a sureshot way to land a job. Would you do that now? Not such a smart idea, right? So what do you do? First off, you must understand what‚Äôs happening.

We live in a disquieting era. We have the highest recorded unemployment in decades, but it‚Äôs not just about the sheer numbers. Built into that, and feeding those numbers, is a process. It‚Äôs also a qualitative thing: we have a fast-changing job landscape, and not enough of the new skills to grab what vacancies there are. This implies that we could well be without a job when the economy revs up. Yes, they want software developers, systems analysts, business operations specialists and such like. But that doesn‚Äôt necessarily or exclusively mean only high-tech skill sets will be called for. Certain sectors will inevitably expand along with a growing population, and old-school human skills will never go out of fashion. Think of the medical sector, for example: we‚Äôll need more nurses, child/geriatric care-givers, physio¬≠therapists. Customer service represen¬≠tatives are here for good too, but they‚Äôll have to become software-oriented. Good-old engineers are in that flux too. The virtuous cycle will be complete when technology comes to the aid of maids and cleaners. The trick is in attuning to the way society and economy are panning out. And in expanding your repertoire of skills that way. What used to be a 30-year assured work cycle or career 50 years ago, shrunk to a 10-year one around a decade back, and now one needs a thorough upgradation every five years to stay relevant.

Terra Infirma Jobs in mining will also radically change in nature.

The trick is in attuning to the way society and economy are panning out. And in expanding your reportoire of skills that way.

Rajeev Kumar (name changed), a 30-year-old from Faridabad, is depre¬≠ssed these days. Four years into working after a BTech in textiles from Punjab, the going was good: he was an assistant merchandiser in a leading garment export house. But the last six months were a nightmare. ‚ÄúI got an offer from another company, and I switched as they were offering an increment of Rs 5,000 per month.‚Äù Too good to be true, of course. Inside of two months, he was told business was down and he should look for a new job. ‚ÄúI joined another company, where too I was handed a pink slip within three months,‚Äù he says. Nothing wrong with how he worked. It‚Äôs just been the worst time for India‚Äôs garment and textile industry, with robust competition from other South Asian countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Indonesia leading to a drastic fall in orders‚Ä¶and massive job losses.

Where does that leave those like Rajeev? Well, he has to chart the inevitable path of skill upgradation. The family situation had kept him from doing a PG, but now he‚Äôs looking to do one in business management or further specialisation‚Äîperhaps a stint at a foreign university for an MTech in non-woven and nano-materials textiles. That‚Äôs where the future lies.

In the first 12 years of this century, India went through a paradoxical period of jobless growth. Things worsened in the past seven years, with armies of sullen and traumatised job-seekers on a march to nowhere. Their ranks swelled as new columns of the freshly retrenched joined them. Right now, there are more and more people looking for jobs that number lesser and lesser. Most of us haven‚Äôt realised that the job market has changed, not just in India, but globally. The stories are legion. Zomato recently fired 540 people, 10 per cent of its staff. You may have heard the numbers. But did you know why? They were all customer support people, and a chatbot-based app came along that could handle customer queries. The firm wanted chatbot managers now. Technology simply erased the old jobs, and created a demand for new ones. Roshini Malik, 27, lost her job after three years as a data-entry operator in an accountancy firm. Reason: her skills were outdated. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd promised myself I would upgrade my skills. I failed because I thought on-job training would be enough.‚Äù Most of us think that, but it was true only of that largely static world of the past. With the planet spinning faster and faster on its axis, you need way more skills, and must regularly add to them, just to stay where you are. Does that leave you in fear and despair? It need not. There are places, both online and physical, where you can study how to enter the future (see graphic).

The digital waves will wash away old sand sculptures, but create new shapes too. Take retail, for instance. With e-commerce swamping the space, cuts in employment are going to be inevitable. But there will be newer roles‚Äîthey will need professionals literate in digital technology and data sciences: retail data analytics, supply chain analytics, digital marketing, customer experience, fraud analytics professional. You get the drift.

Meanwhile, old jobs shrink. The whole world is feeling the pain, and that‚Äôs expressing itself as economic nationalism (think America First, Brexit). So India will ache on account of that too. The first trend, according to an EY report, will be a slowdown of offshore IT work in India, even as overseas jobs for Indians dry up too. A certain ‚Äúsophistication in demand‚Äù will creep up. If the youth stick to traditional skills, and don‚Äôt acquire higher ones, they will be irreparably squeezed by the ‚Äúhourglass effect‚Äù.

The Hourglass Cometh

As old jobs shrink, the world feels the pain. But the digital waves washing away old sand ¬≠sculptures will create new shapes too.

In the near future, as has happened in the West, the job hierarchy will not look like a pyramid, but a skewed hourglass. The so-called middle jobs that require average skills will constrict; the bulk will slip down to a wide bottom, only a minority will upgrade to that slender top. Say there are hundred employees in the world. The top 20 per cent will earn 80 per cent of the annual incomes. The remaining 20 per cent booty will be split between the dozen or more clinging on to the middle and the vast underclass numbering 60-70. For example, in the world of digital apps, the top floor will be taken up by app designers, and a large number of those who will take instructions from the apps, like cabbies and delivery boys, will crowd the base. ‚ÄúPeople will be expected to be smarter, and be able to work with machines. The need for new skills and change around existing skills has accelerated,‚Äù explains Irwin Anand, MD, India, Udemy, a global online learning platform.

Experts say almost half of present jobs‚Äî47 per cent to be precise‚Äîhave a 70 per cent likelihood of being displaced in a decade. The future will create radically new jobs. According to the EY study, by 2022, as much as 9 per cent of India‚Äôs job market will be constituted by work that doesn‚Äôt exist now, and another 34 per cent by jobs that call for radically changed skills. The trend will be sharper, covering 50-60 per cent of jobs, in sectors such as IT and auto. Almost up to a quarter of existing work will be under threat‚Äînaturally, the highest in IT (20-35%) and financial services (20-25%). A Udemy-Deloitte research found that the half-life of skills in traditional sectors is five years, and a much lower 12-18 months in engineering and technology.

Globally, 21 per cent of existing positions will become redundant, and 27 per cent will comprise entirely new work by 2022, according to the World Economic Forum. The nature of the workplace too will change because of new business models. The gig economy will create new, if highly mobile white-collar jobs. The ‚ÄòUber model‚Äô will take over sectors such as healthcare, maintenance and home services. There will be few jobs that don‚Äôt require any digital skills. A McKinsey study shows that, globally, the demand for digitally literate personnel will grow 55 per cent by 2030, and represent 17 per cent of total manhours, up from 11 per cent in 2016. In India, that spike may be much sharper because it‚Äôs at an earlier phase of technology adoption. Again, this doesn‚Äôt call for mere garden-variety IT literacy, but a highly adaptable, constantly evolving brain‚Äîeven within technology sectors. No course will grant you such a brain. Think of the future employee as a self-learning machine.

The so-called middle jobs that require average skills will constrict; the bulk will slip down to a wide bottom.

‚ÄúThe five sectors with the greatest potential are transport and logistics, retail, food processing, construction, tourism, and hospitality. But employers will seek people with digital acumen, and ability to comprehend data,‚Äù says Ashok Varma, Leader (Social Sector), PwC India. A Brookings Institution study shows that, already between 2002 and 2016, the share of jobs with low digital skill requirements fell from 56 per cent to 30 per cent in the US, while the other side zoomed from 5 per cent to 23 per cent. Expect that to curve further.

A mere engineering degree, once a sureshot passport to attractive designations and lucrative salaries, won‚Äôt suffice. A LinkedIn global survey found engineering and technician roles have diminished in the infrastructure and energy sectors. In IT, system administrators began to give way to those who could do experience design and marketing. Adapt and augment, or perish. Indian students seem to have realised this to an extent, by the way. The official AISHE report says admission to professional courses was at a four-year low in 2018-19. In the past five years, enrolments in BTech and MTech fell by 50 per cent! However, the craze for MBA remains: admissions went up by almost 13 per cent during the same period.

Digital Anganwadi

Sectors hitherto considered low-tech ones have witnessed a transformation too. Digital skills are paramount now in state-sponsored infrastructure and welfare schemes. Anganwadi women workers and ASHAs now have to use mobile apps and digital tools in the Swachh Bharat Mission and POSHAN Abhiyaan: recording data. State officials have to handle that data to monitor these projects. E-governance is filtering down. At the same time, the need for human skills and empathetic engagement will increase too in a variety of social sectors, says McKinsey.

Adapt or perish. Even in state-sponsored ¬≠infrastructure and welfare schemes, ¬≠digital skills have become paramount.

The services sector will emerge as the ‚Äúlargest generator of employment‚Äù in the country, says Kamlesh Vyas, partner, Deloitte India. And here, as elsewhere, ‚Äúself-employment will account for over 50 per cent of (future) jobs,‚Äù he adds. Clearly, entrepre¬≠neurship and start-ups will play a critical role. This, of course, redefines the traditional idea of a ‚Äòjob‚Äô in challenging ways. And the challenge is not just to innovate, but to take these innovations to the market, says Sarit K. Das, director, IIT (Ropar). He sees the ‚Äúbusiness angle‚Äù‚Äîthe ability to fructify ideas in a viable way and monetise them‚Äîas the missing link. Social, emotional and leadership skills are key if a young, imaginative person seeks out schemes like Start-Up India, MUDRA and others.

Higher cognitive skills‚Äîadvanced literacy, quantitative and statistical, critical thinking, information processing, interpretation‚Äîis where the game will be. Jobs that require basic cognitive skills‚Äîdata entry, data processing, cashiers, consumer service‚Äîare what‚Äôs declining. Maybe there will be a time differential between how it unfolds in the West and here, but if you‚Äôre smart, don‚Äôt focus only on competences that will take you to the base of the hourglass. Two reasons. First, it‚Äôs a crowded place with intense competition. That, in turn, will depress wages. The trick is to upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.

Companies need to look at reskilling not as additional cost points, but as the nucleus for future growth.

That‚Äôs why online training has become a new hub for the skill development wheel. Millions of young Indians are gravitating to short-term online courses, such as on the AUS-based platform, Coursera. Of its 43 million learners globally, India has emerged as the second-largest market, after the US. In 2018, it added over a million new learners, an average of 95,000 a month. Over 64 per cent of them are in it for computer/data sciences and business. ‚ÄúMost of them hail from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Delhi-NCR, Tamil Nadu and UP,‚Äù says Raghav Gupta, MD (India and APAC), Coursera. And, while nearly three quarters of them are in the 18-29 age bracket, those between 30-39 account for 20 per cent too. A new, vital break in that old, static paradigm where people are usually able to acquire only 20 per cent of the skills they need, as Sumit Kumar, founder of HR solution provider HeadsUp, points out.

It‚Äôs not just people who need to be creative, of course. An enabling atmosphere for job creation calls for sustainable double-digit GDP growth. EY speaks of a ‚Äúdecoupling effect‚Äù that has delinked growth from new incremental jobs. Couple that with a halving of ‚Äúemployment elasticity‚Äù‚Äîthat is, earlier a 10 per cent GDP growth ensured a 4 per cent growth in new jobs; now it‚Äôs 2 per cent. Industry and government have to put their heads together. Companies must look at reskilling not as additional cost points, but as the nucleus for future growth. The government has to extend its present initiatives‚Äîthe ITIs, poly¬≠technics and other skill develop¬≠ment institutes‚Äîin the light of the future transformation. It must not only impart skills for existing jobs, but to prime the youth for future jobs. No point spending huge efforts and money to teach a skill that will become redundant in a few years. And maybe, if enough people upgrade themselves creatively, that hourglass itself can be shattered.

Scared Of IT? What You Can Do

It is a myth that to become a data scientist you need a PhD. A professional ¬≠certificate is suitable for anyone with some computer skills and a passion for self-learning. No prior computer science or programming knowledge is necessary.

Even those who have studied up to just Class XII can do the Google IT Support Gateway certificate. All it costs is Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000. This five-course certificate, developed by Google, prepares a person for an ¬≠entry-level role in IT support. A job in IT can mean in-person or remote help desk work in a small business or at a global company like Google. The course is recognised by several ¬≠national and global IT firms. It equips you to dev¬≠e¬≠lop your skills further in this direction.

Another pretty useful course is What is Data Science? by IBM, which costs Rs 2,700 per month. This ¬≠program comprises nine courses that provide you with the latest job-ready skills and techniques covering a wide array of data science topics, including open source tools and libraries, ¬≠methodologies, Python, databases, SQL, data visualisation, data analysis and machine learning. You will be practising hands-on in the IBM Cloud using real data science tools and ¬≠real-world data sets.

Besides, anyone can opt for short-term online courses on AUS-based platform, Coursera. Of the 43 million learners globally, over 64 per cent study computer and data sciences. India is Coursera‚Äôs second-largest market, after the US.

223,Just 19 pc employers in India bullish on hiring in Oct-Dec qtr: Survey,"New Delhi, Sep 10 (PTI) Only 19 per cent of employers in the country have bullish hiring plans for the next three months, while 52 per cent expect no change in their payrolls, says a global survey which predict softer employment outlook in many markets for the October-December quarter.

According to the ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook survey released on Tuesday, that covered 5,131 employers across India, a net 19 per cent of employers are anticipating an actual rise in their staffing numbers, while 52 per cent expect no change and 28 per cent are not sure about adding to their existing staff strength.

Despite the modest number, India is the fourth most optimistic nation about hiring plans for the next three months globally.

The strongest hiring sentiment was reported in Japan where 26 per cent of employers were bullish about their hiring plans for the October-December quarter, followed by Taiwan (21 per cent) and US (20 per cent) in the second and third positions, respectively.

""Hiring plans for the next three months vary significantly globally with robust outlooks reported in many large markets while the uncertainty of Brexit and the impact of tariffs contribute to evidence of softer hiring intentions elsewhere,"" said Jonas Prising, ManpowerGroup Chairman and CEO.

Globally, ManpowerGroup interviewed over 59,000 employers in 44 countries and territories. The survey noted that employers expect workforce gains in 43 of 44 countries and territories surveyed in the coming three months.

When compared with the previous quarter, employers in 15 out of 44 countries and territories report stronger hiring prospects, while employers in 23 countries report weaker hiring plans which also includes six who anticipate ""no change"".

The weakest hiring activity was reported in Spain (0 per cent), the Czech Republic (2 per cent), Argentina (3 per cent), Costa Rica (3 per cent), and Switzerland (3 per cent).

Chinese employers reported a cautious hiring climate in the coming quarter, as a net four per cent employers anticipate a rise in their staff numbers -- their weakest outlook in two years.

""Having a workforce strategy that attracts and retains critical talent and develops new skills will be a key priority across all organisations as industries continue to transform in the months and years ahead,"" Prising said.

The survey further noted that in India, a sectoral analysis shows, public administration and education employers reported the strongest hiring intentions with a net employment outlook of 27 per cent. While, respectable payroll gains were also forecast in wholesale and retail trade sector (25 per cent) and services sector (22 per cent).

Positive hiring opportunities are expected in manufacturing sector and the mining and construction sector, where outlooks stood at 16 per cent and 13 per cent, and in the transportation and utilities sector at 11 per cent.

Employers in all four regions expect to add to payrolls during the forthcoming quarter. The strongest labour market is expected in the east, where net employment outlook stood at 38 per cent.

Steady workforce gains were also forecast in all the other three regions, south, west and north with outlooks of 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.

The ManpowerGroup Employment Outlook Survey is conducted quarterly to measure employers‚Äô intentions to increase or decrease the number of employees in their workforces during the next quarter. PTI DRR ANS ANS

224,Sodexo Multi-Benefit Pass In India Is Making Employees‚Äô Lives Easier,"Do the innumerable number of cards in your wallet cause you a nightmare? Employee benefit firm Sodexo has launched Multi-Benefit Pass, in order to enhance the employee experience. This is a solution that does not confine its usage to getting meal benefits but also for fuel or other purchases.

Amruta Dhaktode, 30, a software professional in Pune, is quite elated about the launch of multi-benefit pass and said, ‚ÄúI have always found the concept of e-wallet highly intriguing. As Sodexo helped me in ordering in my office premises, this step is going to benefit me for sure but will impact environment too. As this departure from paper coupons will give more impetus to environment friendly digital shopping. How will it help?

The Sodexo multi-benefit pass is a unique solution where a magnetic strip can be used to avail meal benefits across their 100,000+ strong merchant network and can be used across Rupay‚Äôs network of 36 lakh + outlets pan India. It brings many employee benefits like fuel, gift, meal, uniform and books on one card. The company said this is the first such two-in-one card in India and is going to make life of users far more comfortable by ridding of the daily problems.

Rohit Tripathi, 32, a software professional, said, ‚ÄúThis is a great Go-Green Initiative by Sodexo. With single card we can pay for both meal and non-meal expenses. In addition mobile app gives full control on the vouchers and gives me complete statement of purchases and balance. And now I am excited to use 2-in-1 card for multiple purpose.‚Äù

How does it eliminate hassles?

Sodexo multi-benefit Pass eliminates the hassles of managing paper-based claims, eventually increasing work efficiency and is a 100% tax compliant solution.

Other Benefits

Apart from all other benefits, it will be beneficial in many other ways. If companies want to offer digital gifting options to employee, the virtual wallet can be recharged for the particular amount during festivals like Diwali or Christmas.

225,"Layoffs still commonplace in India, IT sector worst-hit:Report","Mumbai, Apr 13 (PTI) Even as the economy grows, job layoffs continue to remain a ""commonplace"" with the automation prone information technology industry employees experiencing more pain than the others, a report said today.

The report comes amid fears of 'jobless growth' being witnessed in the country at present.

""Even as the economy improves, layoffs - due to cost cutting, reducing redundancies after a merger or acquisition, and restructuring events due to changes in the industry - remain commonplace,"" career transition company Risesmart said in a report after interviewing 1,000 executives.

""The survey concluded that employees in the IT sector experienced more layoffs in comparison to employees in other industries,"" a statement issued here said.

It, however, did not elaborate by quantifying the responses across sectors.

In May last year, the then Union labour minister Bandaru Dattatreya had confirmed fears of the 'jobless growth' by stating that the economic growth was not translating into rise in employment opportunities.

""The current growth is a jobless growth. Many European and Asian countries, including India, are facing it... Growth is being reported but it is not reflecting in employment generation,"" he had said.

The government and the ruling party had later explained that jobs created in sectors such as tourism and aviation were not counted for the purpose.

In the statement, Risesmart said India has been one of the biggest employment creators globally but hiring has ""plummeted"" recently and the spectre of job layoffs is hitting both big and small companies.

The big problem facing India now is creating jobs for the youth, said Congress party President Rahul Gandhi. ""When China is creating 50,000 jobs every 24 hours, our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, despite launching 'Make in India', Start up India' and 'Digital India', has only created 450 to 500 jobs in the country, "" Gandhi told a public rally in Raichur town, as part of his three-day North Karnataka tour.

Gandhi was addressing a rally here, as part of the campaign for Karnataka Assembly election.

The Congress chief has frequently took on the Prime Minister over the state of employment in the country.

At a recent rally in Bengaluru, he reiterated the gaps found between the figures promised by Centre and the actual number of jobs created by the Narendra Modi-led government.

Karnataka goes to polls in the first quarter of the year.

227,India Likely to Weather Recession Better Than Most: ILO,"The International Labour Organisation (ILO) believes India is likely to weather the latest global slowdown better than most countries, provided it ensures rising income levels for the working class and enough jobs for a growing working-age population.According to the annual report on global employment by the ILO, ""The main challenge is not unemployment, but rather the high degree of informality that persists despite strong growth.""""The robust growth witnessed in the South Asian region was driven largely by India and was largely due to the rapid rise in labour productivity, rather than an expansion in employment,"" the report, titled, 'Global Employment Trends 2012: Preventing a Deeper Jobs Crisis', said.This situation is prominent in India, which accounts for 74 per cent of the South Asia region's labour force.In India, total employment grew by only 0.1 per cent over the five years to 2009-10 -- from 457.9 million in 2004-05 to 458.4 million in 2009/10 -- while labour productivity grew by more than 34 per cent over this period.Labour productivity is the amount of goods and services that a worker produces in a given amount of time.A major reason for the slow growth in employment in recent years is the fall in female participation in the labour force. This has been most pronounced in India, where participation of women in labour activities fell from 49.4 per cent in 2004-05 to 37.8 per cent in 2009-10 for rural females and from 24.4 per cent to 19.4 per cent for urban females.This drop in participation can only partly be explained by the strong increase in enrollment in education, because it has been evident across all age groups, the report added.The main labour market challenges in South Asia, including India, are two-fold and consist of achieving the twin goals of increasing labour productivity, to ensure incomes are rising and poverty is falling, and creation of enough jobs for a growing working-age population, which is expanding by around 2 per cent each year, the ILO said.With almost 60 per cent of the population in South Asia under the age of 30, governments should take advantage of this demographic dividend, the report said.The global uncertainty stemming from the euro area sovereign debt crisis and continuing weakness of the United States' economy has negative implications for all countries, including those in the South Asia region.""Overall, the worsening economic conditions will make it more challenging for the South Asia region to promote the creation of productive jobs in the non-farm sector and continue the battle against the persistence of informality, vulnerable employment and specific barriers for women and youth in the labour market,"" the report said."
228,"Unemployment, Agrarian Distress Will Be Key Issues In Congress Campaign: Sam Pitroda","Unemployment, Agrarian Distress Will Be Key Issues In Congress Campaign: Sam Pitroda

Employment, employment, and employment -- will be the focus of the Congress' election campaign, party's manifesto committee member Sam Pitroda has said, asserting that the country was going through a jobs ""crisis"".

Pitroda, a long-time Gandhi family adviser and the chief of the Indian Overseas Congress, said ‚Äúagrarian distress‚Äù is also a major issue facing the country and it needs to be addressed.

In an interview to PTI, he said Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will make a ‚Äúhuge impact‚Äù in the general elections.

Priyanka Gandhi and Jyotiraditya Scindia took charge as AICC general secretary UP East and UP west respectively last month.

Asked what would be the key issues the Congress will focus on during the campaign that will strike a chord with the people, Pitroda said: ‚ÄúEmployment, employment, employment.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe country is going through a big employment crisis. We have not created new employment. We have in fact eaten into the employment base we already had. So, today the real challenge is how do we create new jobs,‚Äù he said.

Pitroda said employment has been affected by factors such as demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST).

‚ÄúIf you don't focus on employment there will be a major crisis,‚Äù the technocrat-turned-politician warned.

On whether the Congress has been able to take up the issue of employment in its campaign and narrative, Pitroda said: ‚ÄúYou will see it in the manifesto.‚Äù

He expressed confidence that Congress will finish the process of stitching up alliances in various states and its tie-ups will become clear soon.

Asked if Congress president Rahul Gandhi was matching up to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in terms of being the prime challenger, Pitroda said he doesn‚Äôt see the contest as a challenge between two individuals.

‚ÄúI think it is a challenge between the idea of India. It is about what kind of a nation you want to build going forward, what are the real challenges you have on employment, inclusion and all that,‚Äù he said

Pitroda also said it was a fight of ideologies and a fight between politics of hate and politics of love.

He asserted that ‚Äúagrarian distress‚Äù is also a major issue.

‚ÄúI was told that there is problem of excess supply of onions and potatoes, and the prices are way down and that hurts farmers,‚Äù he said.

Pitroda, who is credited with being the architect of the telecom revolution under Rajiv Gandhi, also alleged that science and technology had been on the ‚Äòback burner in a big way‚Äù under the Modi government.

Asked how the Congress will bring the narrative back to real issues such as employment and alleged agrarian distress post the Balakot air strikes, he said the party will raise key issues on the ground among people.

Pitroda is part of the 19-member Manifesto Committee set up by the Congress to come out with the party's manifesto for the general elections.

Pitroda has worked on the Knowledge Commission and also founded the National Innovation Council later during the Congress-led UPA rule.

229,"Govt Revives 'Compulsory Retirement' Plan For Central Employees, Unions Protest","The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Narendra Modi government's decision to cut deadwood from bureaucracy has invited sharp criticism from employees' unions and former civil servants. The government has recently revived a premature retirement plans for central government employees who have completed 30 years in service or reach 50 years of age after reviewing their performance on a regular basis.

An order issued by Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) on June 20 notifies that all central government establishments must send detailed monthly reports of how many central government employees were reviewed and how many were recommended for premature retirement. Those who are disqualified will be given three-month notice to retire from service.

However, this is not the first time the Modi government is introducing such a measure. In 2014, too, the government moved an order to give premature retirement to central government officials.

Speaking on the condition of anonymity, a former civil servant said the Centre's move was an attempt to privatize government sector.

He also pointed out that since the government has revived the 2014 order after slight modification, it shows its commitment to implement it.

In a bid to rid the bureaucracy of ‚Äúunproductive officers‚Äù, the Centre has now decided to review the performance of bureaucrats on a regular basis.

But this time, the order has been modified and issued to all ministries and departments‚Äîincluding the Prime Minister's Office, President's Secretariat and Cabinet Secretariat.

The order comes at a time when there is a widespread concern in the bureaucratic circle over Modi government‚Äôs forced retirement of top 27 tax officials on the grounds of corruption and misconduct. An official, familiar with the development, says the government‚Äôs decision to induct 400 private sector specialists at middle-level through lateral entry is indicative of a shake-up in the public administration service.

The DoPT order also says, ""The Ministries should ensure that the prescribed procedure like forming of opinion to retire a government employee prematurely in public interest is strictly adhered to, and that the decision is not an arbitrary one, and is not based on collateral grounds as per the order of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of lJOt & Col. J.N.Sinha [1571 SCR (1) 791]‚Äù.

The latest DoPT order states that the review process must be in accordance with the orders in 2014, 2015, and 2017. Detailed guidelines for performance review have been given in the previous order, citing various Supreme Court observations. The new order applies to employees in the A, B, and C groups, whereas the first order applies only to A and B group level officers.

D Manoharan, General Secretary of Southern Railway Employees Union, points out that three lakh railways employees will be affected if the government implements the order. ‚ÄúThe government has issued the order for the second time. They are serious about implementing it. In our view, the government wants to reduce the workforce of the central government slowly and wants to privatize the central government sectors,‚Äù said Manoharan.

He added that employees union will intensify their agitation if the government begins the process of sacking employees."
230,"Govt to conduct new survey on employment, says Debroy","Govt to conduct new survey on employment, says Debroy

New Delhi, Feb 1 (PTI) The government will conduct a new national sample survey on employment, which will show that there has been ""substantial job creation"", prime minister's economic advisory council chief Bibek Debroy said Friday.

Amid a raging controversy over employment data, Debroy also said states are largely responsible for creating ""business environment"" and jobs.

On Thursday, a media report based on the National Sample Survey Office's (NSSO) periodic labour force survey, said unemployment rate had hit a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017-18. However, the same day, the government said it had not finalised the survey on labour force.

""We will have a new round of the NSS which will soon be announced and I am sure that that particular survey will show that there has been substantial employment and substantial job creation,"" Debroy, who is the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (EAC-PM) chairman, said.

In a video message posted on the Facebook page of Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Debroy also said a large part of what happens to ""jobs, employment, the business environment is in the province of the states"".

The EAC-PM chairman also pointed out that India does not have any robust statistical data on job creation after the year 2011-12.

Stating that India's labour force is still informal and unorganised, he said: ""The enterprise surveys provide a very imperfect understanding of what is happening to employment in India.""

Debroy said the real issue is not the number of jobs created but the quality of jobs and wage rates.

Noting that the government per se can only provide a limited number of jobs, Debroy also said the bulk of jobs would have to be created outside the government.

""And this is precisely what the Modi government has been doing by pushing self-employment, by pushing entrepreneurship.

""This is what the prime minister means when he talks about StandUp India, StartUp India,"" the EAC-PM chief said.

On January 28, acting chairman and another member of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) resigned, saying the government had not released the job numbers despite the commission's approval.

The NSSO job report was previously planned to be released in December 2018. PTI BKS CS HRS

236,"India's unemployment rate rises to 7.78%, highest in 4 months: CMIE","India's unemployment rate rose to 7.78% in February, the highest since October 2019, and up from 7.16% in January, according to data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Monday, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in the economy.

India's economy expanded at its slowest pace in more than six years in the last three months of 2019, with analysts predicting further deceleration as the global coronavirus outbreak stifles growth in Asia's third-largest economy.

In rural areas, the unemployment rate increased to 7.37% in February from 5.97% in the previous month, while in urban areas, it fell to 8.65% from 9.70%, the data released by CMIE, a Mumbai-based private think-tank showed."
237,"Unemployment in October rises to 8.5%, highest in over 3 years","Unemployment in October has gone up to 8.5 per cent, the highest in over three years. (Photo: Reuters)

India's unemployment rate in the month of October jumped to 8.5 per cent, which is the highest in over three years.

Fresh data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) showed that the rise in India's unemployment rate in October was the highest since August 2016.

While the government has been announcing a pool of measures to increase demand, the slowdown in jobs is being viewed as the impact of slowdown on the country's economic growth.

To make matters worse, India's infrastructure output for the month of September contracted 5.2 per cent on a year-on-year or YoY basis. It is one of the worst performances by the eight core infrastructure industries.

It is worth noting that as many as seven of eight core industries saw a contraction in output in September.

A new academic research paper released by the Centre of Sustainable Employment also concluded that there has been a significant decline in total employment in India between 2011-12 and 2017-18, reported The Indian Express.

The research paper by Santosh Mehrotra and Jajati K Parida indicated that total employment during the abovementioned period decline by a whopping nine million, adding that this has happened for the first time in Indian history.

Experts also say that the unemployment wave in India has significantly hurt the unorganised sector, which includes a fair amount of season labour. Daily-wage labourers have also been affected due to demand slowdown.

Witnessing a sharp contraction in demand, several manufacturers cut down on production over the last few months, resulting in higher joblessness among individuals working as daily wage or contractual workers."
238,Why Indian economy is not listening to Modi govt,"It has been the story of anti-climax for past several quarters. Country folks expect new numbers to give some good news signaling ""sab change si"" (all is well) sentiment but the Indian economy fails with as much consistency to live up to their expectations. It was expected the pre-budget mini reform would push the numbers up for key indicators of Indian economy but the wrong indicators shot up even after the Budget reforms were proposed in February.

Unemployment figures have gone up in the latest data, released by the the Mumbai-based private think-tank Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) -- from 7.16 per cent in January this year to 7.78 per cent in February. It is higher than the October 2019 figures from pre-November intervention announced by Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Villages have borne the brunt of economic slowdown. Consumption has been particularly low in rural areas creating a ripple effect on the overall health of the Indian economy. The slowdown in consumption is directly related to declining earning or less money in pocket to spend.

Decline in income is the result of loss of employment or rise in unemployment. The CMIE data shows that unemployment rate increased in rural areas from 5.97 per cent in January to 7.37 per cent in February. Silver lining could be the decline in unemployment in urban areas from 9.7 per cent to 8.65 per cent, according to the CMIE.

Growing unemployment is a direct fallout of extended economic slowdown. Indian economy is growing at a 7-year-low GDP growth rate. It was 4.7 per cent in October-December 2019. This came on the back of a 5 per cent GDP growth rate clocked in previous quarter.

The road ahead is worrisome with continued slump in manufacturing coupled with coronavirus outbreak that has proven to be stifling global economic growth. Analysts predict further deceleration of Indian economy on account of coronavirus scare.

Following measures announced in November and then in February Budget - including restructuring of corporate income tax - it was expected that the manufacturing sector would respond positively. But its growth slowed down in February, according to monthly survey by Nikkei Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).

PMI data show that manufacturing sector growth declined from seven-year high of 55.3 in January to 54.5 in February. However, the index is above 50 showing the sector is still expanding.

Meanwhile, Fitch Solutions in its latest estimate cut down its forecast for India's GDP growth for 2019-20 from 5.1 per cent to 4.9 per cent, and from 5.9 per cent to 5.4 per cent for 2020-21. Simply put, Fitch Solutions does not see much scope of recovery from economic slowdown in India.

Weak manufacturing, weaker domestic demand and coronavirus-induced global supply chain breakdown have applied fresh brakes on India's economic vehicle.

The grim sentiment of the market is reflected in credit flow from the banks. It is a key indicator to gauge the undercurrents of a major economy. In India, the bank credit growth declined to 8.5 per cent in January compared to 13.5 per cent during the same month last year.

The sharp decline in credit growth shows either industries are reluctant in applying for loans or the banks don't have enough faith in the ability of the market for repayment. There is another explanation though. That the banks are wary of too much of regulation by the government, the bankers say this in private conversations.

So, the moot question is, why is Indian economy not listening to the Modi government, which has been unleashing reforms after reforms in the manner that it thinks fit?

There is no clear answer even though one can enlist a number of factors from consumption decline to coronavirus effect. There is a clue though in what Hardeep Singh Puri, the commerce and industry minister said at a function in Pune, Maharashtra on Sunday.

""We are already the third largest domestic civil aviation market and handling 435 million passengers per year. We aim to add 100 new airports in the near future. We have 750 civil aircraft manning our skies and adding 2-3 aircraft per week. Is it slowdown?"" he questioned.

One can interpret this as denial of (a problem) economic slowdown by the government or cherry-picking from economic indicators rather than confronting the issue head on. Puri picked up ""more passengers in air"" for instance to defuse economic slowdown theory.

And, he is not the only minister in the Modi cabinet to defend economic slowdown in the last seven quarters."
239,"Cat finally out of the bag: Unemployment at 45-year high, government defends data","The worst fears have come true. Unemployment in the country is at a four-decade-high. The figures released by the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation (MoSPI) on Friday pegged joblessness at 6.1 per cent. The report was released after a long delay.

The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) job survey for 2017-18 had shown a spike in the unemployment rate to over 6 per cent, a 45-year high, but the report was not released by the government, which termed it as a draft report.

Releasing the data, officials said that they have used a new design methodology for the survey hence it was not comparable with previous data.

The Finance Ministry also issued a statement which said that comparing the recent jobs data with past data was faulty.

The annual report (July 2017-June 2018) of the Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS) pegs the all India unemployment rate at 6.1 per cent in the given year. Unemployment was higher in the urban areas as compared to the rural. For the rural areas, the unemployment rate was 5.3 per cent, while in the urban areas it was 7.8 per cent.

Among the rural men, the unemployment rate was 5.8 per cent while among the women it was 3.8 per cent. While among the urban men it was 7.8 per cent and 5.7 per cent among urban women. MoSPI officials said that the number of households surveyed was 433339 (246809 in rural areas and 46006 in urban areas).

The officials, however, said that this data is comparable to the previous years data.

Recognising India's evolving economy and requirements, it was decided to make a few changes with respect to availability of household data on employment-unemployment.

In the PLFS conducted from 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

The rationale for this decision was based on the act that the education levels in the economy have risen due to this various policy interventions like the Right to Education Act etc, and it would be important to assess the level of employment and unemployment using this as a stratification basis, the officials said.

But the Finance Ministry issued a statement trashing attempts to compare the 2017-18 data with previous years.

""There can be nothing farther away from the truth than saying that unemployment in India is at a 45 year low,"" the statement said.

It further said that past jobs data was measured using expenditure of households as a criteria, the current jobs data uses education as a criteria instead of expenditure.

In India, the labour force surveys (Employment and Unemployment Surveys or EUS) have usually been bundled along with the household Consumer Expenditure Survey, conducted typically once in five years. The employment and unemployment surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey till 2011-12 used the monthly per capita expenditure of the household in the selected villages/blocks as a basis for stratification of households.

In the PLFS conducted from 2017-18, a decision was taken to use education levels as a criterion for stratification at the ultimate level.

The change in criteria from monthly per capita expenditure to education levels for stratification of availability of household data on employment-unemployment has direct implications on the comparability of the results of PLFS with the EUS of earlier years, the finance ministry said.

In view of this, the PLFS needs to be seen as a new series for measuring employment and unemployment on an annual basis, it said.

It is important to note that with the rise in education levels in the economy and rise in household income levels, the aspiration levels of educated youth have also risen. Thus they may no longer be willing to join the labour force or work force requiring low skills and low remuneration, the minstry argued in its statement.

The Finance Ministry said that there are various facets to the employment and unemployment scenario and no single data source is complete by itself. These data sets need to be supplemented by data from other sources so as to collectively give a holistic picture of the overall employment market.

In this direction, the ministry has been bringing out a compilation of new subscribers to EPFO, ESIC and NPS to give an assessment of changes in the formal market employment.

The PLFS survey data complemented by administrative data and data from other sources need to be triangulated to get a complete picture.

Reacting to the data, Congress spokesperson RPN Singh said, ""We are satisfied we raised this issue during the elections but now people have made their choice, I hope the government will focus on joblessness in this tenure.""

Notably, this data has been released after a long delay and controversy.

The withholding of the jobs report had made headlines in January this year when three members of the National Statistical Commission (NSC) had resigned protesting against the withholding of the NSSO‚Äôs first Annual Survey on Employment and Unemployment for 2017-18.

The NSSO job survey for 2017-18 had shown a spike in joblessness to over six per cent which was a 45-year high.

But this report was termed as a draft and withheld by the government.

This is the first comprehensive report on the country‚Äôs employment scenario in the Narendra Modi-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government and assumes significance as it captures the impact of demonetisation on the domestic economy.

240,Money for jobless: 4 MPs offer Modi govt a wayout from unemployment maze,"Four Members of Parliament are ready with Private Member's Bill in the Lok Sabha offering a way out for the Narendra Modi government to deal with high unemployment. The bills propose doling out some form of unemployment allowance to jobless citizens.

Three of these MPs belong to the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) -- Gadchiroli-Chimur MP Ashok Mahadeorao Nete, South Delhi MP Ramesh Bidhuri and Jalgaon MP Unmesh Bhaiyyasaheb Patil. The other is Su Thirunavukkarasar, the Congress MP from Tiruchirappalli.

Nete's Unemployment Allowance Bill 2019 seeks to provide an allowance to all unemployed people. Bidhuri's Financial Assistance to Unemployed Post-Graduates Bill 2019, however, restricts the unemployment allowances to unemployed postgraduates only.

Patil's Unemployed Youth (Allowance and Employment Opportunities) Bill 2019 eyes the twin-purpose of generating gainful employment opportunities and payment of unemployment allowance.

Su Thirunavukkarasar's Unemployment Allowance Bill proposes unemployment allowances for jobless youth until they get gainful employment.

Interestingly, the previous Lok Sabha also saw three similar bills seeking unemployment allowances for unemployed youth. But with the dissolution of the Lok Sabha, the bills lapsed.

Unable to tame rising unemployment has been the biggest criticism against the Narendra Modi government in its near six-year tenure. Part of the blame does lie with the central government itself. More than 6.83 lakh posts are lying vacant in the central government, Minister of State for Personnel Jitendra Singh told Parliament last week, in a written reply. And, this was the figure as on March 1, 2018 - almost two years ago.

Now, these bills offer a way out, howsoever unlikely it may seem for them to get the nod of Parliament. These bills don't have approval of the government. The last Private Member's Bill that Parliament passed was in 1970.

But there has been a rush among political parties to garner popular support in the name of unemployment allowances. The Congress proposed one such scheme, with intelligible help from Nobel Prize-winning economist Abhijit Banerjee, during the Lok Sabha election 2019.

Rahul Gandhi, then as the Congress president, announced a minimum income guarantee scheme called Nyay (Nyuntam Aay Yojana). The Congress proposed to give Rs 6,000 to bottom 20 per cent families of India on the basis of their average income. An estimated 5 crore families or 25 crore individuals were to be benefited from the scheme.

However, either the scheme came late into election campaign and failed to strike a chord with the electorate or the voters believed the counter-narrative of the BJP and PM Modi more than the proponents of Nyay scheme. The BJP returned with bigger mandate at the Centre.

Nevertheless, nearly all major political parties have included unemployment allowances schemes in their manifestos in state elections. Some notable examples include the BJP in Rajasthan (Rs 5,000); the Congress in just-concluded Delhi Assembly election (Rs 5,000-Rs 7,500); the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, TRS in Telangana, TDP in Andhra Pradesh and the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha in Jharkhand last year.

In fact, reports from Jharkhand suggest that huge numbers of youth are lining up at the employment exchanges to get themselves registered. They anticipate the Hemant Soren government will fulfill the promise that the JMM made during the Jharkhand election. The JMM promised an unemployment allowance of Rs 5,000-Rs 7,500 to unemployed youths.

Extended economic slowdown and reported highest unemployment rate in the country have made unemployment allowances sell like a hot cake in election. A recent research paper of the State Bank of India has painted a worrier picture of employment in 2020. It said the year would see 16 lakh fewer job creation than the previous year.

These reports of high unemployment rate are at variance with the claims made by the central government and PM Modi, who in his speeches has cited figures from Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) to assert that the country is creating more jobs than before. He has been seen citing the examples of a ""pakodewallah"" or a street vendor selling tea or vegetables.

The official record shows that unemployment among those above 35 is very low. But critics point out that in the absence of a credible social security scheme, youth who fail to get a job of their choice prefer any kind of self-employment to staying unemployed for eternity. This is disguised unemployment, they say.

The last economic survey (the sixth) -- though it reflects the figures of January 2013-April 2014 (that is, before the Modi government came to power) -- shows that close to 72 per cent of all ""establishments"" (read self-employed youths) have no hired labour. They are in all potential disguised unemployment.

This may also be the reason why grey collar job providers such as Quess Corp and Team Lease -- both Bengaluru-based companies -- are among the top job providers in the private sector. However, these firms yet remain largely ""unknown"". They supply the bulk of delivery boys, support staff in logistic companies, hotels, hospitals, cab and security services, receptions, sales and BPOs, IT workers, construction supervisors, and skilled technicians.

Qess Corp has surpassed the Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) as the biggest job provider in India -- 3.85 lakh to 3.6 lakh. Overall, the TCS has lead at about 4.5 lakh workers including overseas employment.

This makes Indian job market very fluid as well as vulnerable to shocks. Moves like demonetisation and single-phase rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) had a more adverse impact on the grey-collar economy than what the government might have prepared for.

The four bills seeking unemployment allowances may offer the government a way to deal with the unemployment situation temporarily, if not in longer term. However, the governments -- both the Centre and in states -- have shown little attention to already existing unemployment allowance scheme under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS).

This promise of unemployment allowances for unemployed job seekers does not get attention of the government. Reports suggest that NREGS unemployment allowances are rarely paid and many state governments usually don't even keep a record of unemployed job seekers who are legally entitled to get the money for government failing to provide her an employment.

For record, establishment-wise, the Indian Army is the biggest employment provider in India with over 14 lakh personnel, followed by the Railways at around 13 lakh and postal department at about 4.26 lakh. In private sector Infosys, TeamLease and Reliance Industries have around or more than 2 lakh employees after the Quess Corp and the TCS.

241,Mood of The Nation 2020: India most worried about unemployment,"As per the data released by the government, India‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in the financial year 2017-18 (Reuters | File)

Unemployment is India's biggest concern, India Today Group-Karvy Insights Mood of the Nation (MOTN) survey 2020 has found.

As per the survey, conducted in December 2019, 32 per cent of 12,141 respondents interviewed in 19 states expressed worry and anxiety over lack of enough employment opportunities. READ METHODOLOGY

When asked which issues concerned them the most, MOTN respondents pointed mostly to economic issues, with 32 per cent identifying unemployment as their biggest concern, followed by farmers‚Äô distress (15 per cent) and price rise (14 per cent). Ten per cent respondents were concerned about the economic slowdown as a whole.

As per the data released by the government, India‚Äôs unemployment rate stood at 6.1 per cent in the financial year 2017-18. The latest numbers on jobs, Periodic Labour Force Survey of the National Sample Survey Office, say that unemployment rate in India in the financial year 2018-19 was at 5.3 per cent in rural India and 7.8 per cent in urban India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs electoral pitch in 2014 elections was centred around generating jobs and employment. He had promised to generate 10 million a year.

While the government has been on the defensive regarding jobs data in India, alleging that data captured does not reflect the changing dynamics of employment in India, but there is enough data to suggest that the problem of unmet expectations related to employment generation is one of the most definitive issues of our times.

The India Today Group-Karvy Insights Mood of the Nation (MOTN) survey 2020 was conducted from December 21, 2019 to December 31, 2019. A total of 12,141 interviews were conducted (67 per cent rural and 33 per cent urban, and an almost equal number of females and males), spread across 97 parliamentary constituencies in 194 assembly constituencies in 19 states."

243,Unemployment at 45-year high: India living a jobs nightmare,"In the winter of 2013, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was speaking at a rally in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. Modiji, those days, not only understood every problem the nation faced, he also had a solution for them. Six years and some months later, his promises have delivered little as India faces an unprecedented job crisis.

The Prime Minister, in 2013, knew that 2/3rd of the Indian population was below the age of 35 and their energy could be used in nation building. He promised to upskill the youth, create more employment opportunities so that India would emerge as a global growth powerhouse. The vision was great but six years later, India is living a jobs nightmare as unemployment is at a 45-year high.

While the situation has ballooned into a massive crisis now, it has been building up over the last few years as falling consumer demand has hit our ability to create jobs, more so for our graduates. The latest data compiled by CMIE shows that urban unemployment has now reached 9 per cent and what is worse that only two out of three job aspirants in the age group of 20-24 get a job. This is the group which completes its education and gets into the job market. Data indicates that while unemployment remains in all segments under 30 and then slips to a 2.5 per cent as people take up whatever job comes their way to put food on the table."

247,Rahul Gandhi: Unemployment is making youth frustrated and Modi-Shah using that anger to benefit themselves,"Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at both the BJP and the AAP during his third public meeting ahead of the February 8 Assembly elections in Delhi, alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal were least bothered about providing employment to the youth and were only using their anger to grab power.

He also accused the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of not wiping out corruption from the country, saying the two parties were spreading hatred and violence in the name of nationalism.

Addressing a public rally in Kondli Assembly constituency for Congress candidate Amrish Gautam, Rahul Gandhi said, ""The atmosphere in India has changed in the last five years. Brotherhood and peace have vanished from the society. What is the reason for this? Many of you will say that this happened due to Modi, the RSS and the BJP.

""But I will put things in a little different manner. The biggest reason is not taking the youth forward. People are scared due to unemployment.

250,"Consumption and unemployment at 4-decade low, Budget 2020 is crucial for economy","Those who believe that one Budget can fix the deep mess, perhaps still believe in magic and fairy tales. They still believe that this government understands the economy and its plans would work. The reality is that this government is part of the problem, not a part of the solution.

‚ÄúIt is not a tiny command and control economy that can be bullied and directed at will. Nor can it be managed through colourful headlines and noisy media commentary,‚Äù former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh had said. Headline management may help the markets but is unlikely to benefit the economy.

If the government is serious about fixing the economy, restoring consumption growth has to be the key focus area. With agriculture growing at 2 per cent and manufacturing in the negative zone, more than 70 per cent of the population is now hit by the slowdown.

The recovery process must start with agriculture and fixing rural demand before it does anything else. With almost 60 per cent of the population linked to agriculture, a 2 per cent growth rate in this segment would mean consumption will not pick up and unless that happens, all talk of revival is going to be just rhetoric. The problem, however, is that government has already played the PM Kisaan card and that too has failed to make much of an impact.

A marginal increase in PM Kisaan scheme rate would be cosmetic and serious recovery can happen only when prices go up. But that too will have limited impact as farmers get only a small part of the increased prices. Food inflation reached 14 per cent in December and has reached a point where it is hurting the poor and the working class.

Former Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian is among the many economists who believe that there is more pain in store for us as things are going to get worse before they get better. The question is how bad will things get and what price will the country have to pay?

The problem for the BJP is that its winning run ended with the Lok Sabha elections and Delhi is unlikely to bring much cheer. Though the CAA-NRC issues have polarised the nation but the shril discourse is unlikely to benefit them politically unless the economy picks up again.

The fact is that the government has pushed itself into a deep economic mess and its goodwill is running out at a rapid pace. The government and the country would be up against serious trouble if the government does not fix it before the end of the year."

257,Unemployability is a bigger issue than unemployment,"According to Kris Lakshmikanth, founder chairman and MD of The Head Hunters India, the curriculum has not kept pace with the rapidly changing times and therefore vacancies can be hard to fill.

Employability will improve when the syllabus reflects the demands of the industry. A Japanese firm that set up an ancillary unit in Karnataka approached Lakshmikanth for help with hiring CNC machine operators. ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt find five good candidates against the company‚Äôs requirement of 200. The skills required for the job are not taught in the five or six colleges,‚Äù he said.

The employability issue will worsen as the years go by, as many jobs will be lost to robots, he added. The incident reflects a misalignment between industry requirements and available resources, which is a major concern for recruiters across sectors. There seems to be an inherent disconnect between curriculumbased learning at the institution level, with the requisite ‚Äòjob ready‚Äô skills needed by Indian corporates. Since Independence, technical education in our country has grown into a fairly large-sized system, offering opportunities for education and training in a wide variety of trades and disciplines at a certificate, diploma, degree, postgraduate degree and doctoral levels in institutions throughout the country.

The main objective of the technical education is that it makes students skilled and technically fit for industries. In other words people with sound technical knowledge cannot remain unemployed. A few observations seem pertinent. First, there has been increasing concern about the employment gap and skills gap. Second, more than half of India‚Äôs population of 1.3 billion is below the age of 25 and finally, the annual demand for new jobs in India is estimated at 12-15 million.

According to the All India Survey 2018 by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) covering 534 Lok Sabha constituencies, spread among various demographics, ‚Äòbetter employment opportunities‚Äô tops the priorities of voters ‚Äì it comes as no surprise though given the state of affairs. ‚ÄúThe single most important thing I find missing in our education system is its ability to help individuals understand why they are studying what they‚Äôre studying; what are their strengths and how can they impact society,‚Äù said Ketan Kapoor, CEO and co-founder, Mettl, an assessment and skill-measurement company.

‚ÄúThe second reason is this culture of working really hard, to aim to be a perfectionist. It is important to understand that the student or the prospective employee is competing not just among peer groups in India but globally,‚Äù he added. India has been witnessing the age of science and technology for long resulting in a huge demand for technical education. The pattern of life evolving in the age is very much different from the one we find in our society even some years back. Technical education contributes immensely to the education system in general and plays an essential role in the social and economic development of our country.

Besides, in this age of joblessness, only technical education can assure us of a good opportunity for employment and successful career. However, the country‚Äôs technical education is beset with many shortcomings India‚Äôs predicament of substandard engineering education is now widely believed. It has left engineers coming out of most of the institutes almost unemployable. There have been some intermittent efforts to improve the situation but most of the efforts either fell short of desired level or failed to bring about any significant changes. However, in order to scale up the overall technical education in the North Eastern Region a regional workshop of the Directors of Technical Education and Principals of polytechnic education of North Eastern Region was held recently (25-27 April, 2019) in Guwahati.

It was hosted by Directorate of Technical Education, Assam under the aegis of National Institute of Technical Teachers‚Äô Training & Research (NITTTR), Kolkata. As many as six Directors of Technical Education belonging to various states, 40 Principals of different Polytechnic colleges from North Eastern Region and faculties and experts from NITTTR attended the workshop. NITTTR, Kolkata was the first among four such institutes (other three being at Chandigarh, Bhopal & Chennai) established by the Dept. of Education, MHRD, Govt. of India as a fully centrally-funded autonomous institution for providing pre & in-service training to teachers and staff of Degree and Diploma level training institutions.

It‚Äôs also mandated for conducting various activities related to quality improvement of the technical education system of the country. The government in 2003 accorded national status to this institute, (along with the three sister institutes) in recognition of the contribution of these institutes for the expert service rendered for overall improvement of quality of Technical Education System. The 3-day workshop was very methodically organised, with wellcurated content.

The workshop‚Äôs programme schedule set the tone for an atmosphere where people felt comfortable deliberating, expressing their thoughts and learning from one another. The individual participants brought to the fore significant issues ranging from shortage of faculties to lack of internet connection, from poor infrastructure to outdated laboratory equipment to severe supply shortage of electricity and water.

Although All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) had assured to address some of the issues but the onus is on state governments. The economic development and growth of a nation depends largely on technical hands. And, therefore India must more meaningfully prioritise quality technical education to boost the prosperity of the nation.

India is in an awful mess given that unemployability is a bigger worry than unemployment. Technology is changing at a brisk pace, so much so that it‚Äôs challenging to grasp. Thus realising the dream of modern India lies greatly with efficient ways of skilling, up-skilling and re-skilling of country‚Äôs rising youth population. The larger question is whether governments both at the centre and states will be able to crack the unemployability problem, or will the problem crack the governments.

258,The Problem: Unemployment or Unemployability?,"Unemployment today has grown to become a major area of concern on a global level. Despite increasing number of educational institutions, growing volumes of academic courses, and booming industries, unemployment in India seems to be on a constant rise.

In a country like India, inspite of there being is a cultural focus on academic learning and professional qualification, a wide disconnect between education and acquiring skills can be observed. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GRE) for Indian higher education has been just 34% which is very low in comparison to developed countries that have a GRE of 56%. In spite of this, close to 60 lakh students graduate every year in several disciplines. Very few of them are deemed fit for employment. Over 70% of these graduates lack basic employable skills and quality. It is estimated that 10 lakh people will join the labour force every month for the coming 20 years and most of them have inadequate training. This may lead to many layoffs.

In a volatile and ever-evolving environment like that of the IT industry, mere formal educational qualifications are not enough. It is necessary to have the relevant IT skills which are allied to the dynamic changes in IT as an industry as well as job roles. Recruiters today, also prefer candidates with high learnability, adaptability and scalability. The lack of these qualities is becoming a strategic concern.

It is emerging more clearly than ever before that what needs to be fixed is unemployability. Unemployability is the illness and unemployment is merely a symptom thereof. The illness needs to be treated and not the symptom.

The skills mismatch is a stark reality staring into the eyes of graduates. There are millions of graduates hoping to start working, but soon realize that the employers are looking for skills that they never even got. This is when young people end up experiencing the bitter and sometimes almost impossible campus-to-corporate transition. While it is indisputably hard on the students‚Äô side, it is also hard for organizations to find suitable candidates for their many positions. There is a severe shortage of progressive institutions that provide updated, quality, industry-oriented higher education due to lack of awareness and absence of industry orientation.

While India is now shrugging off its ‚Äòdeveloping‚Äô country image, majority of the education sector largely lacks the technology and infrastructure needed for hands-on training in the digital sector. This is when the youth are at a disadvantage in the job market by the lack of skills in terms of application.

The Solution

While basic graduation and technical education can be seen as an entry point, students need to invest in employable skills in relevant technologies with specific learning paths. These learning paths should ultimately set the learners on a career path.

The IT landscape is constantly changing and it is the need of the hour for prospective and existing workforce to continuously upgrade their skills in order to contribute to the growth of the organisation, industries, society and the economy. It is time for individuals, institutions and enterprises to come together and engage with relevant platforms to address this issue. The panacea would be in embracing a holistic approach to learning and architecting relevant training methodologies and curricula that align with the industry requirements and job demands.

The current learning ecosystem needs to thoughtfully consider how to architect learning programmes that can be further customised to meet learning objectives while also supporting different learning styles in holistic environments with an outcome-based approach. By responding to the niche expectations of the 21st-century students, and eliminating restrictions regarding what constitutes a learning space, we need to go beyond the confines of traditional methods. It is the need of the hour that we become facilitators and enablers of an enhanced learning process.

The largely adopted brick-and-mortar approach to learning that dates back to early 18th Century has remained virtually unchanged ‚Äì until now. The rise of new pedagogies (such as Blended Learning) has been dominating today‚Äôs educational and learning reforms. Despite the challenges, lack of understanding and a steep learning curve, embracing blended learning is increasingly less of an option and more of a mandate.

Learning as a concept needs to change. It needs to happen beyond the limitations of time and space. It becomes an immersive and engaging indulgence with a series of rich experiences on the pathway to get more employable, and a result fight unemployment. Multiple approaches are needed to solve a problem as large as this. But we need to remember, what needs to be fixed is unemployability, then unemployment will fix itself.

259,"India‚Äôs unemployment touches 8.5%, highest in 3 years: CMIE","Reflecting on the impact of a slowdown in the economy, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) on Friday released its data on unemployment across the country stating, it was increased to 8.5 per cent in October, reports said.

The falling percentage was highest since August 2016 and up from 7.2 per cent in September, stated an article issued in Reuters.

From a year earlier in September 2019, the nation‚Äôs infrastructure output fell 5.2 per cent, the worst performance in years, government data showed on Thursday, stated the report.

The current unemployment percentage as of November 01 on the CMIE site was at 8.1 per cent.

260,Lessons from India‚Äôs jobless growth story,"Jobless growth means that the economy under consideration is experiencing growth, i.e., increasing GDP but at the same time either employment is constant or is in fact decreasing. This term was coined by economist Nick Perna in the early 1990s. Policy makers, academicians and political analysts have time and again shifted focus on the alarming situation of jobless growth in India, especially in the last two decades. The National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO) estimates for the year 2017-18 show that India‚Äôs joblessness was 6.1 per cent of the labour force, which is amongst the highest since 1972-73.

In fact, this unemployment crisis seems to be cutting across location and gender. At 27.2 per cent, urban women are worst-affected, followed by their male counterparts at 18.7 per cent. More men in villages (17.4 per cent) are jobless than women (13.6 per cent). Although it cannot be disputed that the presence of jobless growth in India has been apparent for the past decade and more, the numbers today have become strikingly high. Starting from 2000, India was second only to China in terms of GDP growth. What is being hailed in India is the potential of demographic dividend ‚Äì the large percentage of labour force (essentially in the age group 18-60 years) which is available for employment.

This age group is called the independent workforce as against the dependent population which consists of the age group 0-18 years (children) and above 60 years (older people). Thus, to understand whether India can take advantages of her demographic dividend it is imperative to examine whether growing GDP numbers have actually translated into increasing employment figures. As the economy develops, there is a conventional pattern of a movement of surplus labour from the traditional agriculture or informal sectors to the modern sector (industrial or formal sectors) of the economy.

This is not merely restricted to the theoretical understanding of the models like Lewis and Harris-Todaro but a similar pattern has also been exhibited by the East Asian tiger economies namely Taiwan and South Korea who had achieved a turning point in their development curve by the mid 1990S. As surplus labour gets exhausted, the real wages start increasing. This movement of higher wages essentially means an improvement in the skill and educational levels of the workforce along with the emergence of new industries which demand higher labour skills.

But what has been noticed in India is a slow rate of non-agricultural job generation despite massive escalation in the GDP. Manufacturing sector which is deemed to be the backbone of any economy has largely remained as a ‚Äúmissing-middle‚Äù for India in terms of the employment generation. The trends show that the size of the manufacturing workforce in the country has actually declined between 2004-05 and 2009-10 and in fact India experienced the highest GDP growth rate between 2005-2008 (2005-2006: 9.48%; 2006-2007: 9.57% and 2007-08: 9.32%).

The sluggish growth of the manufacturing sector has remained as a continuous challenge for India‚Äôs growth story. What can be deduced after studying the estimates from various quinquennial rounds of NSSO‚Äôs Employment- Unemployment Schedule is the behaviour of agricultural employment. When the GDP growth rate was the fastest i.e. between 2005-2008, there was a stagnation in the agricultural sector. The growth of the agricultural sector had come down from 3.62 per cent in 1990-91 to 1.97 per cent by 2004-05 and the share of agriculture in GDP has registered a steady decline from 36.4 per cent in 1982-83 to 18.5 per cent in 2006-07.

Yet this sector continues to support approximately 50 per cent of the workforce. Agricultural employment declined during the second half of the 2000s, which led to the slow growth of overall employment in India. Yet another unique feature of India‚Äôs journey of jobless growth is the employment pattern registered for rural women. Between 2004-05 and 2009-10, nearly 22 million women left agricultural work. While the first decade of the millennium witnessed a steep rise in female agricultural employment which was distress driven, the second had an equivalent withdrawal of women from the labour force.

What has been noticed as the possible reason for the movement of women back to the household during the latter period is improvement in the availability of income-earning opportunities for male members of the family. Thus, one can conclude that women enter the workforce only to supplement the income of male members of the family and if they start earning reasonably well, they withdraw from the workforce. This could then be taken to be one of the factors of declining employment while growth was increasing.

The recent trends characterize Indian labour market by three features: 1) There is a predominance of agriculture and the informal sector in total employment. This means that a majority of workers are self-employed and in low quality employment. There has been a slow growth of labour productivity in these sectors. 2) Poverty and distress lead to a situation of vulnerability where participation in the labour market is not out of choice but is governed by changes in the income level. This is clearly indicated by the number of women entering the labour force. 3) The decision to enter and exit the labour market is primarily a response to household earnings.

Besides the above structural inadequacies with respect to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors of the Indian economy, the decision to go in for demonetisation and faulty implementation of GST in recent times has had a serious impact on growth in India. Raghuram Rajan, ex-governor of the Reserve Bank of India, while addressing an audience at the University of Berkley in November 2018 stated that a 7 per cent GDP growth rate is not enough for the kind of people entering the labour market. India needs to create millions of jobs a year to take advantage of the demographic dividend and this can only happen if the Indian economy boosts up both the manufacturing and the agricultural sector.

Stop gap and knee-jerk reaction to the above crisis is not going to help the economy in the long-run. What has been seen in recent months is that the distress in the agricultural and informal sectors have now percolated to the formal sectors. This can be clearly seen by the shutdown policies of the automobile industry, the FMCG sectors amongst others as also the stress in the MSME sectors. All of the above requires recognition of the problem which is equally of the demand-side as it is of the supply side and simultaneously addressing it in all sectors of the economy.

261,‚ÄòUnemployment rate of Bengal lowest in India‚Äô,"Taking a dig at the Opposition, who have been criticising the ever-increasing rate of unemployment in the state, Partha Chatterjee, state parliamentary affairs minister today claimed that the rate of unemployment has come down drastically in the state and is the lowest compared to other states.

‚ÄúThe state of West Bengal registered a lowest ever unemployment rate in recent times. The Opposition, who always cry foul of the state‚Äôs unemployment as one of the grey areas that the government has not been able to fix, should see for themselves the statistics on the unemployment. The rate of unemployment has come down drastically and registered at 4.6 per cent against the national unemployment index of 6.1 per cent,‚Äù Chatterjee observed. It is the lowest among other ‚Äòdeveloped states,‚Äô he claimed.

Listing the names of states among which the state of Bengal registered the lowest ever figure in unemployment, the minister claimed that Gujarat had registered 4.8%, UP 6.4 %, Tamil Nadu 7.6 %, Telangana 7.6 % Rajasthan 5% and Odisha 7.1%."
262,Not by the 3‚ÄôR‚Äôs alone,"As India plunges into an unemployment abyss, comes the grimmer report of the unemployability abyss. Close on the heels of the data released by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy showing India‚Äôs October unemployment rate at 8.5 per cent, the highest since August 2016, come extremely worrisome tidings from the Global Business Coalition for Education, 2030 skills scorecard, prepared by the Unicef and Education Commission.

Of the 300 million children, supposedly the key to India‚Äôs demographic dividend, set to pass school by 2030, 47 per cent will bit a roadblock when seeking entry into the workforce, irrespective of the vocation that they might wish to engage in. Attributing this chasm in the skilling to ‚Äúlow quality of education and sub-optimal vocational training‚Äù, the report clearly establishes that imparting the three ‚ÄòR‚Äôs, Indian style, without insights into how the graduating classes will fit into the rural or urban, tech or nontech, workspace, is making much of the school education system irrelevant for the students and indeed disempowering the future citizen.

Along with the equally appalling numbers from the rest of South Asia, the situation assumes explosive dimensions for the aspirational youth across the region, a situation that may still be avoided by a concerted shift in the teaching paradigm to address current job needs.

The daily addition to the rolls of these poorly-qualified job seekers is ‚Äúnearly 100,000 young South Asians‚Äù, as the Unicef emphasizes, with ‚Äúalmost half of them not on track to find 21st century jobs‚Äù.

The unfortunate circumstances created by their often inconsequential passage of a decade in school is not ameliorated by any corrective mechanism in higher education, which in fact intensifies the malaise; another ailment diagnosed by several studies over the past few years. Thus much of the education ecosystem is rendered out of sync with the knowledge ~ and even the not-soknowledge ~ based economy.

Back in 2016, an Assocham study talked of 93 per cent of business management graduates being unemployable; only seven per cent standing a chance of participating productively in the management ecosystem because their schools did not have the rigorous academic instruction structure considered de rigeur for grappling with management complexities in the world today.

Matters do not improve with engineering education either, with upwards of 80 per cent of graduating engineers being deemed unemployable for want of technical, cognitive and linguistic requirements for softwarerelated jobs and certainly not for such esoteric spheres as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science and mobile development.

Regrettably, schools do not even train students for very simple, mechanical work that could make them useful for the rural sector, for instance.

The bottomline, for a populace ill equipped to handle livelihood issues is the perpetuation of poverty and faltering economic growth. The writing is clearly on the wall today; as is India‚Äôs unpreparedness to address mass poverty clubbed with depression and anxiety."
263,Solution for unemployment,"The Indian economy continues to expand. As a corollary of rapid economic expansion more jobs are available today than before, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

Most Indian leaders see the growth of the manufacturing sector as a solution for unemployment and underemployment across the country. Demand in the developed world for manufactured goods has led more than one exporting nation to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty.

In spite of the rise in automation, leaders and intellectuals in India, believe that a manufacturing-led export-driven growth model is a way to superior economic growth.

Industries are creating more jobs than ever before: Potentially, within seven years the size of the manufacturing sector in India may generate huge revenues. Be it in manufacturing, construction or mining, new jobs are being created in India and the pace of new job growth is expected to continue rising.

Hence the employment landscape is already being transformed into one, which generates jobs in relatively higher paying manufacturing industries. Since the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990‚Äôs, a third of the new jobs have been created in the construction sector.

Manufacturing to pave the way to future prosperity: Manufacturing create products by using raw materials or components. Over the next 5 to 7 years, millions of new jobs are expected to be created in the domestic manufacturing sector.

Indian economists believe that the manufacturing sector will comprise of a quarter of the size of the Indian economy by 2025. Currently, manufacturing‚Äôs share in the Indian economy is approximately 16 per cent.

The largest number of jobs that will be created may be low paying unskilled or semiskilled jobs that nonetheless, for innumerable diligent and enterprising young workers, could pay the way for a financially rewarding and personally fulfilling career. The creation of a large number of such jobs will help move millions of Indians into the middleclass.

High value manufacturing jobs exist today: However what is truly exciting is that a significant number of jobs in this sector require much technical expertise, which comes after years of education and training.

Graduates and mechanical engineers and those with post-graduate degrees today have ample opportunity to thrive in this field in India.

An expanding domestic manufacturing sector will lead to the creation of many more such well-paying jobs that will be able to employ young Indians for decades to come.

Specifically, there are attractive jobs for engineers and for those with advanced degrees in production management and quality testing.

Furthermore, today there also many ancillary jobs in areas such as procurement, storage, supply chain, finance and accounting and the availability of such jobs will also increase in the future.

Manufacturing industries have created tertiary jobs: Job opportunities today extend beyond simple assembly line manufacturing jobs. Many white collar jobs have been created by the manufacturing industry in tertiary industries such as customer support and management.

Much of the demand for skilled engineers, draftsmen, programmers, electricians and technicians is being created by the manufacturing industry in India.

Furthermore, rising consumer expectations have led manufacturers to take quality initiatives and hire production experts who ensure finished products meet quality standards.

Indian manufacturers have also realised the need for quick and efficient customer service, which has led to the direct creation of numerous support and backend jobs.

PPE‚Äôs in era of manufacturing led growth: As the manufacturing sector expands, even more people will be employed in the innumerable factories and workshops that will manufacture products in India.

After the creation of new and varied jobs in hazardous manufacturing environments, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) will also grow.

Already most large and small Indian manufacturers recognise the importance of worker safety and so there is great demand for PPE across India. The manufacturers of personal protective equipment are themselves, manufacturers.

As the number of factories and industries grows in India, the size of the PPE manufacturing sector will also grow. Manufacturers of safety equipment create safety products that are in great demand by those in the construction and mining industries.

The buying and selling of these equipments have also created numerous new jobs. For the next few decades, the number of jobs created by manufacturers of PPE will increase in lockstep with the increase in the number of manufacturing jobs in India.

264,A better skilled India,"Despite the contrary view of Niti Aayog, unemployment in India has reached alarming proportions. As of now, 4.83 crore job-seekers are registered with the employment exchanges‚Ä¶ of whom only 3.39 lakh have been placed. These statistics do not cover masons and labourers, who seek employment only in the informal sector. These figures also do not include rural unemployment and under-employment, for which no reliable statistics are available.

Such a high level of unemployment entails a humongous cost in terms of human capital going waste. There is a still greater social cost because parents who had spent beyond their capacity to educate their children at expensive private institutions feel duped by the system; the children themselves feel inadequate and depressed. Often one sees an unedifying spectacle of thousands of highly qualified young men and women competing for some lowly job, which is much below their capabilities. There are reports of lakhs of unfilled posts of primary school teachers, constables etc. This is a major anomaly.

Such paradoxes have their genesis in the way Indians imagine the desiderata of a job. For many, a permanent Government job means the freedom to work according to their whims‚Ä¶ seldom with a view to achieve organisational goals. Since even the lowest Government functionary wields enormous power, the effect of such a lackadaisical attitude is disastrous for good governance. On the other hand, the Government, being a model employer, provides its employees with all benefits which a prosperous company provides. No wonder the Government is not enamoured of the idea of providing further employment though the shortfall in ranks often results in sub-standard services for the poor citizen.

India contends with such a high level of unemployment primarily because our social planners have failed to take note of ever-changing job requirements. At the time of Independence, with few exceptions, education was only for the rich. Many zamindars and moneyed people went to college, not to prepare themselves for employment but only to add the letters B.A. or M.A. to their names. For those so inclined, a good arts degree was enough to land a good job. The varna vyavastha took care of the aspirations of the rest (about whom no one bothered). However, with the democratisation of education and an exponential growth in population, unemployment posed a forbidding challenge in the early 1970s. Nonetheless, the economy was expanding and there still was no real problem for well-qualified youths in landing a job ~ even if it was in the USA.

The advent of computerisation in the first decade of the current millennium exacerbated the unemployment problem to calamitous levels. Suddenly, entry-level office jobs became scarce. At the same time, liberalisation filled our markets with high-class imported goods which slowed down the growth of the indigenous manufacturing sector. These developments ensured that the growth in jobs did not keep pace with the growth in the economy. Overseas opportunities also declined because the entire globe became a single market so far as goods and services were concerned. At the same time our traditional job markets like the US and the Middle East put in place firewalls to prevent the entry of non-citizens.

The process and skill-sets required to land a good job in India are completely at odds with the processes and skill-sets required in other countries. The Civil Services Examination is the gold standard for conducting a job test. This examination, which tests around 8 lakh job aspirants, mainly in general topics, takes around 18 months and selects only 1000 persons. A similarly structured examination for bank officers has 18 lakh applicants, selecting only 3,000 persons. The cost and inefficiency of such exercises is evident but all Government examinations mimic this model. So we have similar examinations for geologists, foresters, inspectors and clerks resulting in extraordinary wastage of time and manpower with attendant frustration.

Our job position can only worsen given the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and Robotics which have led to a situation where humans would face an uncertain future in the job market. Robots are fast replacing humans in high precision factories in Europe. If we are to manufacture high quality goods, we would have to follow suit, leading to job losses. Already, online sellers are cornering the retail market ~ a development which portends a gloomy future for small businesses. Driverless cars, powered by AI, have the potential of making millions of drivers jobless‚Ä¶ though given our chaotic traffic and potholed roads it would take some time for such cars to reach our shores.

So we have two challenges before us. After tackling the current unemployment problem, we would have to re-skill our workforce for the future. Skilling India was a commendable initiative, which never took off. Sadly, before the Skilling India programme could commence in right earnest we are faced with a situation where traditional jobs are vanishing and totally new ones are taking their place. Obviously, the time has come to re-imagine the jobs and job requirements of the future. Trying to look into the future, one can safely assume that the agriculture and infrastructure sectors will always remain relevant. With more time and money available, tourism, entertainment, leisure and sports are some of the sectors which may bloom in the future. To be competitive in the new job market, we would have to visualise the skill-sets required for these new age jobs. Then, we would have to impart the requisite skill-sets to our youth in our colleges and universities.

Finally, we will have to construct exact mathematical models to predict job requirements in the emerging sectors so that we can avoid a glut in some sectors and drought in others. Our current system is so unprepared for the real world that even the elite IITs are looking at an unprecedented crunch in placements for many branches of engineering ~ a situation that could easily have been avoided by juggling courses.

Re-skilling would be difficult, requiring a thorough revamp of education as we know it. The generalist education model would have to be discarded. We would have to direct school children to the vocational stream of their choice right from the secondary level. Courses would have to be specifically designed for all categories of occupations be it farmer, shopkeeper, office worker, mechanic etc. Re-skilling would ultimately lead to excellence in all branches of enterprise.

To avoid unemployment, it would have to be ensured that the input in each stream would be proportionate to the anticipated vacancies in that particular line at the time students complete their courses. We may keep the German model in view, which works on similar lines and yield excellent results.

Thomas Carlyle once observed, ‚ÄúA man willing to work, and unable to find work, is perhaps the saddest sight that fortune‚Äôs inequality exhibits under this sun.‚Äù (Chartism) Unfortunately, we have a large number of desperate jobseekers. To prevent human misery, if for no other reason, we have to ensure that all those who are willing to work get gainful employment."
265,The Gig Economy,"Hardly a generation ago, a person with a decent university degree, if he tried hard enough, could land a job proportionate to his qualifications. Today, we have the spectre of engineers, post-graduates and MBAs vying for peons‚Äô and constables‚Äô jobs. A long-delayed report released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation shows unemployment at a 45 year high of 6.1 per cent and urban unemployment still higher at 7.8 per cent.

With the working age population slated to rise by 96.5 million during 2021-31 and by 41.5 million during 2031- 41, the coming days would see the pressure on jobs increasing to horrifying levels. Yet, at the same time, corporate honchos are bemoaning the non-availability of qualified persons for jobs in their organisations. It would appear that there is a complete mismatch between the qualifications that job-seekers have and the qualifications desired by job givers.

Our present education system trains students for clerical jobs which are now extinct thanks to the computerisation of business processes. The almost complete absence of students for arts, science and even engineering courses in most colleges ~ which has led to the closure of many educational institutions ~ shows that there is no future for mediocre students in traditional jobs. Decision makers are still required, for which employers look to top students of top colleges. Almost thirty lakh positions are lying vacant in Central and State Governments which the Government fights shy of filling for various reasons, mainly because persons hired by the Government soon forget their duties and insist on an amplified sense of entitlement.

Practical reasons like the existence of many types of quotas increases the difficulty in hiring a person to work in the Government. To get over such problems, the Government has started outsourcing its ministerial and menial work in a big way which results in poor service to the public and reduces the chances of regular employment in Government jobs. With regular employment opportunities shrinking both in the Government and the private sector, the jobs on offer are of a different kind ~ drivers for Ola and Uber, delivery boys for Swiggy and Zomato and repairmen for Urban Clap.

The term ‚Äúgig‚Äù has been coined for such jobs, that is, for jobs for which workers are paid for each individual gig (piece of work) they do ~ such as food delivery or a car journey ~ instead of monthly salary/days wage/hourly wage. ‚ÄúGig workers‚Äù reduce operational costs and companies like Uber employ ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers on a large scale. The downside is that gig workers cannot be relied on for confidentiality and proper teamwork, which lessens the quality of their output.

Yet, the movement towards a ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù is a world- wide phenomenon, with almost 30 per cent of the workforce in the US and Europe being employed in the ‚Äúgig economy.‚Äù ‚ÄúGig‚Äù jobs can be a perfect solution for people who do not want to work for regular hours or at a defined workplace, but ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs cannot be said to be jobs in the sense we understand it. If backed by a social security system, like that of the West, taking up ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs may still make sense but in India with no social security worth the name, ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs are taken up only in desperation.

What are called ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs today were more correctly classified as under-employment by economists like John Maynard Keynes. Studying under-employment at the time of the Great Depression, Keynes concluded that economies land into an undesirable under-employment equilibrium because of oversupply and insufficient demand for labour. There is said to be oversupply when the labour force is over-educated for the skill level of available employment opportunities in the economy. Insufficient demand amplifies the problem.

At a time of undesirable under-employment equilibrium, well-qualified workers face a tougher job market and have to settle for jobs originally meant for less skilled individuals. Learning a lesson from the rampant under-employment during the Great Depression, the US Bureau of Labour Statistics calculates the ‚ÄúUnder-employment Rate‚Äù every month from 1948. Regrettably, under-employment is not an issue in mainstream discussions in India. Even under-employment statistics are not maintained by the Government.

Maybe, for this reason, our leaders laud and treat the jobs created by the ‚Äúgig‚Äù economy on par with regular jobs, little realising that a rising level of ‚Äúgig‚Äù employment is a symptom of a slowing economy and ‚Äúgig‚Äù jobs are a slow poison for workers because ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers work for extremely long hours in pitiable conditions. Labour laws classify ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as independent contractors which means they have no fixed working hours, no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holidays or sickness pay.

The wretched condition of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers has persuaded a London Employment Tribunal to classify ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as ‚Äúworkers‚Äù, entitled to basic rights. A fortnight ago, the state of California passed a bill that requires companies like Uber to treat ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers as employees. Reacting belatedly, our Government has proposed a Social Security Code that would, inter alia, address the problems of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers.

However, the proposed Social Security Code would subsume eight central labour Acts, which may result in delay and lack of focus on the plight of ‚Äúgig‚Äù workers. ‚ÄúSkill India‚Äù and ‚ÄúMake in India‚Äù are excellent programmes to tackle unemployment and under-employment, but the problem is that little has been done to push these programmes. Reacting to the current slowdown in the economy, the Government is trying to revive the economy from the supply side by cutting tax rates and re-capitalising Public Sector Banks, which would increase investment. Given the time lag between investment and production, we may have to wait for some time for employment to pick up.

Quicker results would have followed had the Government invested the same amount of money in rural jobs and infrastructure. If we want to avoid becoming a permanent ‚Äúgig economy‚Äù we have to link our education system to trade and industry to ensure that a student coming out of the education system has requisite skills for the jobs on offer and there is no oversupply in any discipline. The New Education Policy (NEP) could have ensured such a synergy but making students job-ready is not an objective of the NEP. That said, the NEP has a commendable intention of promoting vocational education but given the huge paucity of institutions imparting vocational education, the desired results may be difficult to achieve in the near future.

Probably, it is time the Government stepped in with a wellstructured employment generation programme to ameliorate the misery of the youth who are forced to take up jobs much below their qualifications. Jobless growth is a terrifying prospect.

266,Tripura: Unemployment paints a gloomy picture as BJP govt turns one,"The Bharatiya Janata Party, which came to power on the mantra of ‚ÄúSabka Saath, Sabka Vikas‚Äù to lead a coalition government in Tripura completed its first year in office on 9 March. According to Chief Minister Biplab Deb, Tripura is on the path towards becoming a model state. One of the major issues, which BJP promised to solve, was unemployment. However, after one year of rule, it seems the BJP has failed to curb the burning issue of Tripura unemployment.

The data compiled by the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy lucidly indicates that the employment scenario continues to be on a sticky wicket. The CMIE data of February 2019 puts the Tripura unemployment rate at 26.1 per cent, which is the highest in the country. It is to be mentioned that during February 2018, the last month of the Left government, the percentage of unemployment was 30.2 per cent, which was again the highest in the country.

The CMIE data of February this year compared to February last year points out that there has been a 4.1 per cent reduction and this may be seen as a small achievement of the BJP government. However, this is the other side of the picture. Only in March and April 2018, Tripura didn‚Äôt feature as the state with the highest percentage of unemployment in the country. But for the later months, barring July, till the latest report of February, Tripura registered the most number of unemployed people in India. In September, the unemployment percentage rose to 39.1 per cent ‚Äî the highest within a year. In October and November, the percentage was more than 30 per cent. These figures clearly show that the Deb-led BJP government has failed to curb rising unemployment in the state, which was the main election issue highlighted by the saffron party during its Assembly election campaign.

The CMIE data of Tripura is available from September 2017. In that year, Tripura‚Äôs unemployment was the highest in India at 19.4 per cent. For the later three months ‚Äî October, November and December ‚Äî the percentage was reduced to 8.5, 8.2 and 13.2, respectively. Unemployment again rose to 31.2 and 30.2 per cent respectively in January and February 2019. So, it means that during the Left era, Tripura was not always the state with the highest percentage of unemployed in the country.

The state government‚Äôs dramatic decision in August last year of cancelling ongoing recruitment raised eyebrows about its seriousness to control the issue of joblessness. The order included cancellations of exams that were to be held under the Tripura Public Service Commission, which affected around 14,000 candidates. Many alleged that the decision was mainly political rather than administrative as it cancelled the recruitment earlier initiated by the CPM-led Left government. There were allegations that by cancelling the TPSC recruitment, the BJP government was trying to dictate an autonomous body.

Also, interviews taken under the monitoring of High Court of Tripura in January 2018 for the Tripura Civil Services and Tripura Police Services were cancelled by the state government inviting more criticism.

Recently, as mentioned by a leading media wire of Tripura, the High Court in the state has issued a show cause notice to the government questioning it about the cancellation of the recruitment drive for filling up 838 posts of male constables. The decision of the High Court came after four writ petitions by the job aspirants, who had qualified for the posts in 2017.

In the writ petitions, they stated that they were qualified for the posts but due to the declaration of the Assembly polls, the police authority couldn‚Äôt release letters of offer. However, the new government cancelled the entire process of interviews.

Last year, in August, a news daily of the state reported that the Left government was ready with a list of around 2,000 candidates for the Tripura State Rifles and Tripura Police but that couldn‚Äôt be released due to the declaration of the Assembly elections. Later, the recruitment process was again done away with by the new BJP government.

Also, there have been allegations against the BJP government of limiting the vacant posts of the Teachers‚Äô Eligibility Test. As local media reported, the present government declared only 180 vacant posts for TET-I, against the advertisements of 6,422 vacant posts done by the previous Left government. In case of TET-II, the number of vacant posts declared by the CPM government was 1,470. But the new government recruited only 319 teachers. Last year, Deb in an interview to a national daily, had spoken of creating 700,000 jobs within 30 months. But after the completion of 12 months, the ground situation presents a gloomy picture regarding jobs.

Curbing unemployment in the state was the major election promise of BJP. However, the BJP government seems to have failed to control joblessness in the state with the percentage of unemployment even higher under its rule. Tripura is still figuring as the state with the most number of unemployed in the country. These facts question the seriousness of the BJP government in solving the most burning issue of the state.

267,"50 lakh jobs lost after demonetisation, youth, women worst hit: Report","Nearly 50 lakh people in India lost their jobs between 2016-2018, a report said highlighting that the ‚Äúbeginning of the decline‚Äù coincided with demonetisation, although ‚Äúno direct causal relationship could be established‚Äù between the trends.

The report by Azim Premji University‚Äôs titled State of Working India was based on the CMIE-CPDX data that highlighted India‚Äôs unemployed were mostly the youth.

‚ÄúIn general, women are much worse affected than men. They have higher unemployment rates, as well as lower labour force participation rates,‚Äù it added.

The report revealed that unemployment, in general, has risen steadily post 2011. Both the Periodic Labour Force Survey and the CMIE-CPDX report the overall unemployment rate to be around 6 per cent in 2018, double of what it was in the decade from 2000 to 2011.‚Äù

‚ÄúAmong urban women, graduates are 10 per cent of the working age population but 34 per cent of the unemployed. The age group 20-24 years is hugely over-represented among the unemployed.

‚ÄúAmong urban men, for example, this age group accounts for 13.5 per cent of the working age population but 60 per cent of the unemployed.‚Äù

Besides, the report noted that ‚Äúin addition to rising open unemployment among the higher educated, the less educated (and likely, informal) workers have also seen job losses and reduced work opportunities since 2016.

Earlier in February, the National Sample Survey Office‚Äôs (NSSO‚Äôs) periodic labour force survey (PLFS) had stated that India‚Äôs unemployment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 per cent in 2017.

The NSSO report was reportedly based on data collected between July 2017 and June 2018 and is the first official survey post-demonetisation.

However, the NITI Aayog debunked claims of jobless growth saying that the report was not a final one.

Earlier, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) had stated that 1.5 million jobs were lost just in the first four months of 2017‚Äîimmediately after demonetisation of old 500 and 1000 rupee notes.

The issue hogged the limelight after two independent members of the National Statistical Commission ‚Äî acting Chairman PC Mohanan and JV Meenakshi ‚Äî resigned on January 28 over a disagreement with the Government on certain issues.

One issue pertains to the government withholding the release of the results of NSSO‚Äôs quinquennial survey, for the year 2017-18 even though the commission approved the report. This gains significance in the wake of the government being criticised for a scarcity of jobs in the country.

268,Solution for unemployment,"The Indian economy continues to expand. As a corollary of rapid economic expansion more jobs are available today than before, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

Most Indian leaders see the growth of the manufacturing sector as a solution for unemployment and underemployment across the country. Demand in the developed world for manufactured goods has led more than one exporting nation to lift millions of its citizens out of poverty.

In spite of the rise in automation, leaders and intellectuals in India, believe that a manufacturing-led export-driven growth model is a way to superior economic growth.

Industries are creating more jobs than ever before: Potentially, within seven years the size of the manufacturing sector in India may generate huge revenues. Be it in manufacturing, construction or mining, new jobs are being created in India and the pace of new job growth is expected to continue rising.

Hence the employment landscape is already being transformed into one, which generates jobs in relatively higher paying manufacturing industries. Since the liberalisation of the Indian economy in the early 1990‚Äôs, a third of the new jobs have been created in the construction sector.

Manufacturing to pave the way to future prosperity: Manufacturing create products by using raw materials or components. Over the next 5 to 7 years, millions of new jobs are expected to be created in the domestic manufacturing sector.

Indian economists believe that the manufacturing sector will comprise of a quarter of the size of the Indian economy by 2025. Currently, manufacturing‚Äôs share in the Indian economy is approximately 16 per cent.

The largest number of jobs that will be created may be low paying unskilled or semiskilled jobs that nonetheless, for innumerable diligent and enterprising young workers, could pay the way for a financially rewarding and personally fulfilling career. The creation of a large number of such jobs will help move millions of Indians into the middleclass.

High value manufacturing jobs exist today: However what is truly exciting is that a significant number of jobs in this sector require much technical expertise, which comes after years of education and training.

Graduates and mechanical engineers and those with post-graduate degrees today have ample opportunity to thrive in this field in India.

An expanding domestic manufacturing sector will lead to the creation of many more such well-paying jobs that will be able to employ young Indians for decades to come.

Specifically, there are attractive jobs for engineers and for those with advanced degrees in production management and quality testing.

Furthermore, today there also many ancillary jobs in areas such as procurement, storage, supply chain, finance and accounting and the availability of such jobs will also increase in the future.

Manufacturing industries have created tertiary jobs: Job opportunities today extend beyond simple assembly line manufacturing jobs. Many white collar jobs have been created by the manufacturing industry in tertiary industries such as customer support and management.

Much of the demand for skilled engineers, draftsmen, programmers, electricians and technicians is being created by the manufacturing industry in India.

Furthermore, rising consumer expectations have led manufacturers to take quality initiatives and hire production experts who ensure finished products meet quality standards.

Indian manufacturers have also realised the need for quick and efficient customer service, which has led to the direct creation of numerous support and backend jobs.

PPE‚Äôs in era of manufacturing led growth: As the manufacturing sector expands, even more people will be employed in the innumerable factories and workshops that will manufacture products in India.

After the creation of new and varied jobs in hazardous manufacturing environments, the demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) will also grow.

Already most large and small Indian manufacturers recognise the importance of worker safety and so there is great demand for PPE across India. The manufacturers of personal protective equipment are themselves, manufacturers.

As the number of factories and industries grows in India, the size of the PPE manufacturing sector will also grow. Manufacturers of safety equipment create safety products that are in great demand by those in the construction and mining industries.

The buying and selling of these equipments have also created numerous new jobs. For the next few decades, the number of jobs created by manufacturers of PPE will increase in lockstep with the increase in the number of manufacturing jobs in India.

274,It‚Äôs official: Unemployment rate at 45-year high,"It is now official that the country has indeed been witnessing jobless growth.

Months after rejecting the claim by a leaked report that India‚Äôs unemployment rate had touched a 45-year high, the government admitted the same on Friday with the latest data showing that joblessness had indeed touched 6.1 per cent in the 12-month period from July 2017 to June 2018.

The government had earlier brushed aside a leaked official report on the country‚Äôs poor job scenario and maintained that the unemployment data was yet to be finalised.

The Centre had come under fire for witholding the key macro data, with the opposition parties alleging that it was a deliberate attempt to hide its non-performance.

Moreover, some members of the Statistical Commission had earlier resigned to protest against the government decision to withold the data.

The official release has come a day after Narendra Modi took oath as Prime Minister for the second time on Thursday in the backdrop of high public expectations on jobs and economic growth.

The official data showed 7.8 per cent of all employable urban youth as being jobless during the survey period, while the percentage for the rural areas stood 5.3 per cent.

The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of persons unemployed among the total the labour force. Nearly 10 million youth join the country‚Äôs workforce every year.

The data poses a huge challenge to the Modi government which has returned to power for the second term on the promise that it will set policies right and ensure faster economic growth and employment.

The gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate has plunged to its lowest in the last five years to touch 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2018-19.

280,"Over 15 lakh Assam youths are jobless, says Industry minister","More than 15 lakh educated youths are unemployed in the state, of which 1.5 lakh jobless will be given skill development training to make them employable in 2017-18, Assam government informed the Assembly on Wednesday.

Replying to a query by BJP MLA Chakradhar Gogoi during Question Hour, Industry Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said the total number of registered educated unemployed youth in Assam is 15,23,531.

""In 2017-18 financial year, initiatives are taken to train 1.5 lakh educated unemployed youths under various skill development programmes and make them self reliant and job worthey,"" Patowary said.

During the current financial year, various long-term and short-term training were imparted across the state, he added.

Asked about the measures to provide jobs, the minister said, ""we shall talk to all the new industries coming to the state and ask for thir manpower requirements. Accordingly, we'll provide the manpower and they will take skilled youths.""

In a written reply to a separate question by AGP member Phani Bhusan Choudhury, Patowary said Assam currently had 35 government and 96 private skill development centres."
281,"‚ÄòAll-round mismanagement‚Äô by the Govt responsible for economic slowdown, says Former PM Manmohan Singh","As the GDP growth fell further in the last quarter, former prime minister and finance minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday said the state of country‚Äôs economy was ‚Äúdeeply worrying‚Äù and urged the government to put aside ‚Äúvendetta politics‚Äù and reach out to sane voices to steer the economy out of the ‚Äúman-made crisis.‚Äù

The Congress leader said ‚Äúall-round mismanagement‚Äù by the Modi government was responsible for the slowdown. ‚ÄúThe state of the economy today is deeply worrying. The last quarter‚Äôs GDP growth rate of 5 per cent signals that we are in the midst of a prolonged slowdown. India has the potential to grow at a much faster rate but all-round mismanagement by the Modi government has resulted in this slow down,‚Äù he said in a statement.

Singh said the country‚Äôs youth, farmers and farm workers, entrepreneurs and the marginalised sections deserve better. India cannot afford to continue down this path, he said, adding, ‚ÄúI urge the government to put aside vendetta politics, and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds, to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.‚Äù

Singh said it is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector‚Äôs growth is tottering at 0.6 per cent. ‚ÄúThis makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST,‚Äù he said.

The former PM alleged that institutions are under attack and their autonomy is being eroded. On government taking Rs1.76 lakh crore from the RBI reserves, Singh said the resilience of the RBI will be tested after this record transfer to the government.

This, he said, ‚Äúclaims that it (government) does not have a plan on what it will do with this windfall.‚Äù Noting that domestic demand is depressed and consumption growth is at an 18-month low and nominal GDP growth is at a 15 year low, he said, ‚ÄúThere is a gaping hole in tax revenues. Tax buoyancy remains elusive as businessmen, small and big, are hounded and tax terrorism continues unabated. Investor sentiments are in doldrums. These are not the foundations for economic recover.‚Äù

Blaming Modi government‚Äôs policies for massive job-less growth, he said more than 3.5 lakh jobs have been lost in the automobile sector alone. There will similarly be large-scale job losses in the informal sector, hurting most vulnerable workers, he said. He said rural India is in terrible shape as farmers are not receiving adequate prices and rural incomes have declined.

The low inflation rate that the Modi government likes to showcase comes at the cost of our farmers and their incomes, by inflicting misery on over 50 per cent of India‚Äôs population, he alleged. The former prime minister, a noted economist, said the credibility of India‚Äôs data has come under question under this government.

‚ÄúBudget announcements and rollbacks have shaken the confidence of international investors. India has not been able to increase its exports to take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in global trade due to geopolitical realignments. Such is the state of economic management under the Modi government,‚Äù he alleged. The scathing attack by the former prime minister comes after the country reported a slow GDP growth rate of 5 per cent for the first quarter of this fiscal.

Sharp deceleration in manufacturing output and subdued farm sector activity pulled down India‚Äôs gross domestic product (GDP) growth to over six-year low of 5 per cent in the April-June quarter of 2019-20.

Singh‚Äôs prediction of GDP decline post demonestisation was also realised. Widely credited for launching India‚Äôs economic reforms in 1991, Singh had termed Modi government‚Äôs demonetisation move, ‚Äúorganised loot and legalised plunder.‚Äù He had also warned that the drastic step would bring down country‚Äôs GDP growth by 2 per cent, which it did in the following year."
282,"‚ÄòGodse, Modi believe in same ideology‚Äô: Rahul Gandhi attacks PM over CAA, NRC, jobs","Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP from Kerala‚Äôs Wayanad constituency, Rahul Gandhi on Thursday lashed out at the Prime Minister saying that Mahatma Gandhi assassin ‚ÄúNathuram Godse and Narendra Modi believe in the same ideology‚Äù.

Speaking at a public meeting in Kalpetta, Gandhi further said that ‚Äúthere is no difference except that PM Modi does not have the guts to say he believes in Godse‚Äù.

Further drawing similarities between Godse and PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi said: ‚ÄúNathuram Godse shot Mahatma Gandhi because he loved no one, cared for nobody and believed in nobody, and that is the same with our Prime Minister, he only loves himself, only believes in himself.‚Äù

Rahul Gandhi remarks regarding Godse comes as India pays tributes to Mahatma Gandhi on his death anniversary.

Rahul Gandhi said that PM Modi does not have words when asked about issues of unemployment and jobs and tries to divert the attention.

‚ÄúNRC and CAA are not going to get jobs. The situation in Kashmir and burning Assam are not going to get jobs for our youth,‚Äù he added.

Rahul Gandhi further said that Indians are being forced to prove their citizenship and questioned how Prime Minister Narendra Modi could decide if one is an Indian or not.

‚ÄúIndians are being made to prove that they are Indians, who is Narendra Modi to decide if I am Indian? Who has given him the licence to decide who is Indian and who is not? I know I am an Indian and I do not have to prove it to anybody,‚Äù he asserted.

Earlier in the day, the Congress leader led the ‚ÄòSave the Constitution‚Äô march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad.

Accompanied by senior party leaders and workers from the state, Gandhi began his march from the SKMJ High School road to the new bus stand at Kalpetta ‚Äî a distance of two km.

Gandhi waved to a huge crowd which had rallied along the route to have a glimpse of their MP.

The Congress leader had arrived here on Wednesday night."
283,Underemployment more serious than unemployment: Niti Aayog,"""Severe underemployment"" and not unemployment is a more serious problem as a job that needs to be done by one person is often performed by two or more workers, says the government's policy think tank Niti Aayog.

This assertion comes amid Congress's criticism of the Narendra Modi government over creating lesser jobs.

In its draft three-year action agenda report for 2017-18 to 2019-20, the Niti Aayog stressed on the need for creation of high-productivity and high-wage jobs.

""Indeed, unemployment is the lesser of India's problems.

The more serious problem, instead, is severe underemployment.

A job that one worker can perform is often performed by two or more workers,"" it said.

The draft report was circulated among the Governing Council members (consisting of chief ministers of all states and others) of the Niti Aayog on 23 April.

Contrary to some assertions that India's growth has been jobless, the Employment Unemployment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO), which till date remain the most reliable sources of information on the country's employment situation, have consistently reported low and stable rates of unemployment over more than three decades, it said.

Citing examples, the Niti Aayog said as per NSSO survey, in 2011-12, 49 per cent of the work force was employed in agriculture but the sector contributed only 17 per cent of India's GDP at current prices.

Second in 2010-11, firms with less than 20 workers employed 72 per cent of India's manufacturing workforce but contributed only 12 per cent of manufacturing output, it said.

According to 2006-07 NSSO survey of service firms, the 650 largest enterprises accounted for 38 per cent of services output but only employed two per cent of service workers.

""Put another way, the remaining service firms employed 98 per cent of the work force but produced only 62 per cent of the outcome,"" the report said.

Citing the example of China's ageing work force, the Niti Aayog stressed on attracting big firms working in that country to India which has availability of large workers at competitive wages.

""The experience of countries that managed to transform rapidly, such as South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and China, shows that the manufacturing sector and the ability to compete in the vast global marketplace hold the key to the creation of well-paid jobs for law and semi-skilled workers.

""The 'Make in India' campaign needs to succeed by manufacturing for global markets,"" it said.

The report said due to an ageing work force in China with high wages, many large-scale firms in labour-intensive sectors currently manufacturing in that country are looking for lower-wage locations.

""With its large workforce and competitive wages, India would be a natural home for these firms,"" the report said."
284,BJP led Central govt trying to hide economic slump by data manipulation: Congress,"The Delhi Congress on Saturday started a ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô rally to protest against the BJP-led government at the Centre, calling it responsible for the ‚Äòfinancial ruin‚Äô in the country and saying the Centre was trying to cover up the economic slump through manipulation of data.

The ‚ÄòHalla Bol‚Äô rally continued today as well. Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee President Subhash Chopra led the party workers in the rally. They held the the Central government responsible for the large scale unemployment, price rise, the heavy losses suffered by businessmen and industrialists following demonetisation and the resultant economic slump.

The rally saw the participation of the former Union Minister Ajay Maken, Chairman of Campaign Committee Kirti Azad and AICC Secretary Kuljeet Singh Nagra .

Senior Congress leader Maken while addressing the rally said that if the Modi government stated the truth instead of juggling with statistics, the ground reality would be very frightening, as in the first quarter of 2019-20, GDP growth was at an abysmal low of 5 per cent, which was ‚Äúvery shameful‚Äù for the Central government.

‚ÄúThe Modi government is trying to cover up the economic slump through manipulation of data,‚Äù Maken said.

‚ÄúIMF, Fitch, World Bank, Moody‚Äôs and even the Reserve Bank of India have cut India‚Äôs growth forecast,‚Äù he said, adding that India has dropped to the level of 7th largest economy from being the 5th largest in the world.

He further added that the people of Delhi were the worst-affected by the economic slump."
285,Labour reforms the antidote to India‚Äôs perpetual job crisis,"The lack of jobs is beginning to haunt the Modi government. The Reserve Bank of India‚Äôs recent Consumer Confidence Survey shows that public perception is also beginning to take account of the fact that there are no jobs available in the economy. According to the survey, 43.7 percent of responders felt that the employment situation had worsened as compared to 31.9 percent a year ago.

The official unemployment numbers, which hover at around five per cent, will never reflect the true picture since in a developing economy, where poverty is high and unemployment benefits are virtually non-existent, no one can afford to remain out of the workforce for long. They usually find employment doing odd jobs or in the agricultural sector.

However, job creation numbers do give a clearer picture. According to the Labour Bureau, the Indian economy was generating around 900,000 jobs in 2010 and 2011. Since then, the jobs created in the economy have consistently fallen, reaching around 135,000 in 2015 as opposed to the need for an annual generation of over 11,00,000 jobs. The situation has not improved since.

However, this is not a recent phenomenon. The Indian economy has never been good at creating jobs. As per popular estimates, including those of the RBI, India‚Äôs employment elasticity, which is a measure of the percentage in employment for a one percent change in economic growth, has been around 0.2 in the post-reform period. This implies that as the real GDP rises by 10 percent, employment will merely rise by two percent. To put things in perspective, International Labour Organisation (ILO ) estimates Brazil‚Äôs employment elasticity to be an impressive 0.9.

This long-term trend shows that there is a structural reason behind this problem. When an economy transitions from agricultural-led to a modern one, it undergoes three key transformations: Movement of labour out of agriculture into industry and then services, shift of workers from informal into the formal sector and finally a rapid pace of urbanisation as more industries are set up in the rural areas around cities.

India has missed the bus on all three of these fronts. Industrial development never took place in India and the economy became service-led right away. Employment in industry and services remains predominantly informal. Consequently, the pace of urbanisation has slowed in India.

Moreover, whatever industrial development has taken place in India has been either capital-intensive or skilled labour-intensive. India‚Äôs labour-capital ratio in a vast majority of industries has been lower than other countries at similar levels of development. The very opposite is needed for job creation in a developing economy. But why has the pace of development been so skewed for India? What is so different about India that made it deviate from the historical trend of structural transformation for economies around the world?

India‚Äôs notoriously rigid labour laws are the leading cause behind these anomalies. Labour falls under the concurrent list of the constitution, which implies that both the Centre and the states can form laws on it and neither has been miserly about this. When combined, each state ends up with over 200 different labour laws. These disincentivise firms from growing beyond a point. For instance, the Trade Unions Act of 1926 requires firms with seven or more workers to form trade unions. The Factories Act of 1948 mandates manufacturing units with 10 or more workers to have several working hour limits and work place conditionalities that become stricter with more workers.

The most burdensome of all is the Industrial Disputes Act (IDA) of 1947, which covers all industrial disputes and makes it almost impossible for firms with 100 or more workers to fire anyone. Establishments require permission from the labour department to lay anyone off and such permissions are rarely given even if the firm is unprofitable. Therefore, firms with six or less employees have the most labour flexibility.

As expansion of firms comes with high legislative costs in India, it is rational for them to remain small. This is why 84 per cent of manufacturing employment is restricted to micro and small enterprises in stark contrast with other developing countries (46 per cent for South Korea and Thailand, 27 per cent for Malaysia and 25 per cent for China).

India‚Äôs labour laws have inhibited the growth of manufacturing firms, which lose out on the gains they could have made from economies of scale and innovation. Due to these reasons India has not been able to undergo industrial development and is finding it difficult to gain from the rise in labour costs in China. India could have been the next manufacturing hub after China but since there is a sheer lack of capability; countries like Bangladesh and Vietnam have been thriving in labour-intensive sectors like textiles.

Labour reforms are, therefore, the antidote to India‚Äôs perpetual job crisis ‚Äî but this is politically sensitive topic. The Modi government is in a unique position of being capable enough of pushing through such bold reforms since it has the numbers needed for this. However, considering how most of its attempts at reform have backfired, this will be the farthest thing on the government‚Äôs mind. A piecemeal attempt at labour reform with the Small Factories Bill, which aims to exempt factories with 40 workers from 14 labour laws, has been in limbo for the last two years.

However, on a positive note, some state governments are beginning to allow larger firms to retrench workers without seeking permission with their own amendments to IDA. Hopefully, it will not be too late before India manages to extricate itself from this mess of its own creation."
286,Jobless growth won‚Äôt help India,"As Narendra Modi completes three years as prime minister, he must seriously worry about his government's inability to meet the single biggest promise he had made in his election speeches in 2014 ‚Äì providing jobs to new entrants in India's labour market.

""I can't do much about those in their fifties but I want to transform the lives of those in their twenties who are seeking new employment,"" Modi had said.

Providing gainful employment opportunities is essential for enabling people to improve their standard of living. For a country like India, which has surplus labour and a strong affinity for new technologies, employment generation in the 21st century poses a new challenge. More recently, the sluggish growth of various sectors of the economy, especially post demonetisation, has made this challenge more severe.

According to the labour ministry's 27th Quarterly Employment Survey of eight employment intensive industries -textile, leather, metals, automobile, gems, Transport, IT and handloom & power loom, there were 43,000 job losses in the first quarter of FY 2015-16. The second quarter was somewhat better, with 134,000 new jobs.

During the decade 2001-11, the growth rate of the labour force (2.23 per cent) was significantly higher than the growth rate of employment (1.4 per cent), which itself was several-fold less than the growth rate of the economy.

According to Census 2011, the average growth rate of the economy was 7.7 per cent per annum, when it was only 1.8 per cent for employment.

The trend of a significant gap between the pace of GDP growth and that of employment growth has given rise to the phenomenon of ""jobless growth"" in India. The limited impact of booming growth on employment generation is captured in an indicator called employment elasticity or the rate of change of employment per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) growth.

This has been secularly declining in the 2000s from 0.44 from 1999-2000 to 2004-05 to a near-zero level of 0.01 from 2004-05 to 2009-10. The situation has worsened due to weak industrial growth, a struggling agriculture sector with widespread drought, cost rationalizations in several sectors and the knock-on effect of a global slowdown. Also, traditionally labour-intensive industries are beginning to increasingly mechanize their operations.

While it makes them more productive and profitable, it also shrinks job opportunities.

The economy has become less labourabsorbent. In 2015, the government expanded the scope of organised industry from just eight manufacturing sectors to include some key services industries such as education and health. This was clearly done to bump up the employment growth figures because the manufacturing sector was showing a very poor growth trend ‚Äì around 1.5 per cent annually ‚Äì whereas the service sector was doing much better and growing at 7-8 per cent.

Adding service sectors to the organised sector employment data has helped the government show a slight improvement in new jobs growth in 2016. Prima facie, it is difficult to believe that industries were hiring when the economy was paralyzed by notebandi for about four months.

The bulk of the organised industry was busy managing the new situation caused by demonetisation, with a fall in the sales of manufactured items nearly across the board.

Large manufacturers are trimming operations, throwing many jobs into jeopardy. Nokia, locked in a tax dispute with Indian authorities, shut down its factory in Chennai in November 2014, rendering 8,000 workers jobless. Zomato, a food tech company, laid off 300 employees, or 10 per cent of its workforce, last year as the business went through a squeeze. Currently, the manufacturing sector has an overall employment share of 12-13 per cent.

While this share has been growing, the manufacturing sector has been losing people to the services sector, which is seen as more glamorous, better paid and gain international exposure.

Yet, there are some areas that still stand out when it comes to job creation, notably the financial services and the financial technology sectors. Ever since the RBI granted licenses to around 21 banks in 2015, employment opportunities have been growing. The banks have been opening new branches and hiring personnel to augment their services. Similarly the entry of outfits such as PayTM which combine technology with financial services is also giving a new impetus to job creation.

There is a need to understand that there will always be a trade-off between technology and the workforce previously performing that task. Jobless growth will only ensure that the demographic dividend becomes a demographic curse. There are several steps the government would need to take to bring the country out of this jobless growth trap.

One of them is the reform of labour regulations. Labour law reform that encourages greater flexibility while providing a safety net for the unemployed is equally necessary. Rajasthan has set an example through a recent state-level amendment where it raised employment threshold for enforcement of some of the restrictive provisions of the Factories Act and also raised the minimum membership for the registration of a labor union from 15 to 30 per cent of the firm's employment.

Encouraging states to make their own amendments is a step in the right direction. Additionally, the Centre has rightly set up a web portal for the self-filing of compliance reports pertaining to various central labour laws. India also needs to enable its workforce to adapt to the changing skills requirements accompanying technological progress.

Regulation of enterprises is a major factor that affects job creation. Simplification coupled with ""smarter regulations"" is the way to go. Encouraging people's entrepreneurial instincts will generate sustainable outcomes. The government could incentivise job creation by giving infrastructure a push. The credibility of employmentunemployment data needs to be established.

At present, the source used for estimating the employment/unemployment rate in India is NSSO data. However, this data is not available annually. Since 12 million people enter the labour force annually, frequent periodic assessment of the labour market is essential.
