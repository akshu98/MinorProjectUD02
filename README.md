<h1>Reliability and Bias Reporting of Online News Media</h1>
The proliferation of online news media has made content creation, sharing news and spread of information very easy. On one hand this has given rise to faster spread of information but on the other there has been an increase in the spread of false and unreliable information. Although there are many platforms that are developing methods for filtering out unreliable content, most of them involve manual fact checking of unreliable news. The objective of the project is to take a large set of articles from various news sources, group them into related stories, then further analyse them to determine the reliability of news articles. We are also identifying the political bias of the news sources. We present here multiple features and metrics that have been determined to capture the reliability of news articles and bias of the news sources.
