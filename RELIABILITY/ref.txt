doc to vec - entire doc to vector dense vector representation


all possible tokens in the doc - check number of tokens - if it is in million

gensim - doc to vec - train on all document -- generate vectors for those docs
use those vectors to perform the agglomerative or k-means clustering


cosine similarity thresholding may not be a good approach
