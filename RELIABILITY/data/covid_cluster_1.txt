explaining several people couple week covid virus virus escaped lab united state china pandemic hit every year evidence behind conspiracy theory quite widely circulated people say virus virus released institute virology tell institute virology outstanding virologist quality work good conspiracy theory u actually taking virus virus china releasing military game held evidence lot sequencing study done one good thing particular outbreak ready people share sequence come virus around globe sequence analysed people really know nice thing know virus virus modified tell virus virus modified signature way modifying virus virus understood virologist looking evidence modification people done multiple group modified virus virus virus virus evolved time virus link virus found animal evident link engineered virus virus based best analytic technique available today reputed credible biologist multiple laboratory evidence actually coming theory going around plague happened great cholera outbreak south southeast happened flu happened covid well remember even read little bit would read flu actually start started lasted soldier returning world war took virus virus around world go whole theory pandemic happening every year think ready prepared hospital capacity prepared everything know think important understand disturb ecosystem thing happen keep destroying forest contact higher probability virus animal getting human evidence glacier melting permafrost melting come glacier melting know hidden think lesson lesson taking care ecosystem really taking care world many people want know see peak outbreak model prevalent one believe many people would get infected many would likely die pandemic understand model exactly model based certain assumption valid given time model always fail uncertainty human biggest uncertainty virus virus exploit human therefore brings big uncertainty heard extreme one model say crore going get infected lakh lakh death essentially mean anywhere population get infected really feel bit extreme seen reasonable model come group called study group made scholar based u mainly student faculty prediction best case scenario roughly infection roughly death worst case scenario lakh infection death say model model based assumption involved group spent fair amount time sitting advisory committee world health organisation view model one thing remember model model actually lot data data patient really based testing done far testing limited imported case contact last week last week report case known contact look building model need know population life structure population interacts term structure occupation general nutritional profiling lot survey done country inform building model like look survey look census data information disease based incoming traveller actually happening outside country look model currently available three model highlighted great model built using assumption based data coming part world given viral infection expect behave differently different population one piece information important transmission model shape form country called social mixing interacts long would important refine data social mixing model derived population know much greater density population mean transmission likely high far possible looking generate data better inform existing model pedestrian covering face protect coronavirus walk past wall graffiti march photo know virus virus behaving different age group people initial thinking child get infected know child get infected rate age group seem see milder disease age go see severe disease individual know get get severe disease mortality higher virus virus behave differently really response host ability infected person handle virus virus determines severity outcome seeing severe disease respiratory distress multi organ failure factor age reason lot chemical modulators released infection see younger people seem tide better know young people smaller proportion young people get severe disease severe symptom die proportion higher get older age effect seeing something unique virus virus many virus show mild asymptomatic disease child grow get infection get severe disease two example think immediately chickenpox hepatitis get chickenpox child get fairly quickly get chickenpox adult bad course infection second hepatitis people growing almost everyone age hepatitis infection antibody get protect life grow environment bottled water get infection adult hepatitis bad infection far old age concerned realise older people accumulated lot disease high blood pressure bad lung either growing polluted city smoking virus virus affect lung accumulate grow older probably getting far higher mortality effective government response system far need done curb spread virus virus term government response think thing understand quickly need move pandemic seen last day rapid acceleration government responding look government done place look look south shut country focused approach essentially tested lot lot lot people identified infected people isolated infected people made sure contact followed look government started exactly thing identify infected people coming follow contact make sure thing going well term isolating contact following quickly started see story escaping quarantine people hiding travel history lot thing happened made u insecure ability identify case coming country ability trace contact response situation trying much possible limit people interacting people think one thing reflects back people asked age structure referred disease level talk term transmission source transmission largely young people working people young school college lot interaction working people whether formal informal sector lot contact idea shutdown idea limiting travel stay place stay place long take disease manifest need ready test baseline say two week nobody going anywhere anybody developed symptom tested find whether coronavirus stayed place number contact relatively small able quarantine contact let everybody right move around much want contact people much want rapidly reach stage able test people people get sick hospital facility available enough bed available big worry right data know dealing government exactly right thing need get message people everywhere far possible treat self family potential source infection try infect people initially short period time buy u enough time build system allow u test treat biggest worry right mean people live place isolation difficult instruction around hand washing difficult know may toilet home need moving communicate kind message give think important thinking advice give practical actionable granular level water think could think designating paper towel piece cloth use touch frequently touched object wash hand time day enough water wash cloth careful touching health department official doctor participate mock drill hospital march photo term research main priority right focus diagnostics first vaccine building capacity ventilator middle pandemic urgent thing capacity building ensure enough hospital enough personal protective equipment health worker without grave risk need get ready making sure enough ventilator doubt mind situation need build capacity treat people top priority research think important thing cooperation collaboration opportunity really good research low hanging fruit one mentioned sequence virus know world put different strain covid virus virus public database country size capability put two idea virus virus evolving country enough expertise country quickly sequence capacity nobody access virus virus virus virus national institute virology council medical research nobody else access able sequence example lab containment facility grow virus virus way fairly easy virus virus grow culture imagine lab lab culture going one could testing whole bunch molecule somebody may come nice hit somebody may come existing drug work covid opportunity always lose reluctance country share high probability community transmission already started think likely community transmission given case without known contact history extent community transmission know yet speaking looking whether hospital admitting large number case severe respiratory infection patient ventilator think every hospital always function capacity little difficult test widely start get data testing patient currently admitted severe respiratory infection must remember testing regime liberalised last week laboratory unable test notification went weekend next week going lot laboratory ramping capacity test hope testing severe acute respiratory illness patient give u sense much get going hospital need looking testing need done community give u sense big problem keep time get sense trajectory well better inform model allow u make prediction need emphasising stronger response believe community transmission happening right unable measure testing scale really unreasonable believe outbreak like community transmission happening simply look number reported daily basis see steep curve becoming hard believe community transmission happening alarmed gather evidence build proper contingency lab going testing one hope reliable data term number country size testing really limited conversation transcribed lightly edited clarity
